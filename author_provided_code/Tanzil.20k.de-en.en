In the name of Allah, most benevolent, ever-merciful.
ALL PRAISE BE to Allah, Lord of all the worlds,
Most beneficent, ever-merciful,
King of the Day of Judgement.
You alone we worship, and to You alone turn for help.
Guide us (O Lord) to the path that is straight,
The path of those You have blessed, Not of those who have earned Your anger, nor those who have gone astray.
ALIF LAM MIM.
This is The Book free of doubt and involution, a guidance for those who preserve themselves from evil and follow the straight path,
Who believe in the Unknown and fulfil their devotional obligations, and spend in charity of what We have given them;
Who believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed to those before you, and are certain of the Hereafter.
They have found the guidance of their Lord and will be successful.
As for those who deny, it is all the same if you warn them or not, they will not believe.
God has sealed their hearts and ears, and veiled their eyes. For them is great deprivation.
And there are some who, though they say: "We believe in God and the Last Day," (in reality) do not believe.
They (try to) deceive God and those who believe, yet deceive none but themselves although they do not know.
Sick are their hearts, and God adds to their malady. For them is suffering for they lie.
When asked to desist from spreading corruption in the land they say: "Why, we are reformers."
Yet they are surely mischief-mongers, even though they do not know.
When asked to believe as others do, they say: "Should we believe like fools?"
And yet they are the fools, even though they do not know.
When they meet the faithful they say: "We believe;" but when alone with the devils (their fellows), they say: "We are really with you; we were joking."
But God will turn the joke against them and allow them to sink deeper into evil and wander perplexed in their wickedness.
They are indeed those who bartered away good guidance for error and gained nothing from the deal, nor found the right way.
They are like a man who kindles a fire, and when its glow has illumined the air God takes away their light leaving them in the dark where they will not be able to see.
They are deaf, dumb and blind, and shall never return;
Or like rain pouring from the sky which hides within it darkness, thunder and lightning. They thrust their fingers into their ears for safety against noise and death.
But God surrounds those who believe not from all sides.
Verily the lightning could snatch away their eyes. When it flashes forth they walk in its flare.
When darkness returns they stand still. And if the Lord wills so He could take away their hearing and sight; surely God is all-powerful.
So, O you people, adore your Lord who created you, as He did those before you, that you could take heed for yourselves and fear Him
Who made the earth a bed for you, the sky a canopy, and sends forth rain from the skies that fruits may grow -- your food and sustenance. So, do not make another the equal of God knowingly.
If you are in doubt of what We have revealed to Our votary, then bring a Surah like this, and call any witness, apart from God, you like, if you are truthful.
But if you cannot, as indeed you cannot, then guard yourselves against the Fire whose fuel is men and rocks, which has been prepared for the infidels.
Announce to those who believe and have done good deeds, glad tidings of gardens under which rivers flow, and where, when they eat the fruits that grow, they will say: "Indeed they are the same as we were given before," so like in semblance the food would be.
And they shall have fair spouses there, and live there abidingly.
God is not loath to advance the similitude of a gnat or a being more contemptible; and those who believe know whatever is from the Lord is true.
But those who disbelieve say: "What does God mean by this parable?"
He causes some to err this way, and some He guides; yet He turns away none but those who transgress,
Who, having sealed it, break God's covenant, dividing what He ordained cohered; and those who spread discord in the land will suffer assuredly.
He gave you life when you were dead. He will make you die again then bring you back to life: To Him then you will return.
He made for you all that lies within the earth, then turning to the firmament He proportioned several skies: He has knowledge of everything.
Remember, when your Lord said to the angels: "I have to place a trustee on the earth," they said: "Will You place one there who would create disorder and shed blood, while we intone Your litanies and sanctify Your name?"
And God said: "I know what you do not know."
Then He gave Adam knowledge of the nature and reality of all things and everything, and set them before the angels and said: "Tell Me the names of these if you are truthful."
And they said: "Glory to You (O Lord), knowledge we have none except what You have given us, for You are all-knowing and all-wise."
Then He said to Adam: "Convey to them their names."
And when he had told them, God said: "Did I not tell you that I know the unknown of the heavens and the earth, and I know what you disclose and know what you hide?"
Remember, when We asked the angels to bow in homage to Adam, they all bowed but Iblis, who disdained and turned insolent, and so became a disbeliever.
And We said to Adam: "Both you and your spouse live in the Garden, eat freely to your fill wherever you like, but approach not this tree or you will become transgressors.
But Satan tempted them and had them banished from the (happy) state they were in.
And We said: "Go, one the antagonist of the other, and live on the earth for a time ordained, and fend for yourselves."
Then his Lord sent commands to Adam and turned towards him: Indeed He is compassionate and kind.
And We said to them: "Go, all of you.
When I send guidance, whoever follows it will neither have fear nor regret;
But those who deny and reject Our signs will belong to Hell, and there abide unchanged."
O children of Israel, remember the favours I bestowed on you.
So keep your pledge to Me, and I will mine to you, and be fearful of Me,
And believe in what I have sent down which verifies what is already with you; and do not be the first to deny it, nor part with it for little gain; and beware of Me.
Do not confuse truth with falsehood, nor conceal the truth knowingly.
Be firm in devotion; give zakat (the due share of your wealth for the welfare of others), and bow with those who bow (before God).
Will you enjoin good deeds on the others and forget your own selves?
You also read the Scriptures, why do you then not understand?
Find strength in fortitude and prayer, which is heavy and exacting but for those who are humble and meek,
Who are conscious that they have to meet their Lord, and to Him they have to return.
Remember, O children of Israel, the favours I bestowed on you, and made you exalted among the nations of the world.
Take heed of the day when no man will be useful to man in the least, when no intercession matter nor ransom avail, nor help reach them.
Remember, We saved you from the Pharaoh's people who wronged and oppressed you and slew your sons but spared your women: In this was a great favour from your Lord.
Remember, We parted the sea and saved you, and drowned the men of Pharaoh before your very eyes.
Yet, remember, as We communed with Moses for forty nights you took the calf in his absence (and worshipped it), and you did wrong.
Even so, We pardoned you that you may be grateful.
Remember, We gave Moses the Book and Discernment of falsehood and truth, that you may be guided.
Remember, Moses said: "My people, by taking this calf you have done yourselves harm, so now turn to your Creator in repentance, and kill your pride, which is better with your Lord."
And (the Lord) softened towards you, for He is all-forgiving and merciful.
Remember, when you said to Moses: "We shall not believe in you until we see God face to face," lightning struck you as you looked.
Even then We revived you after you had become senseless that you might give thanks;
And made the cloud spread shade over you, and sent for you manna and quails that you may eat of the good things We have made for you. No harm was done to Us, they only harmed themselves.
And remember, We said to you: "Enter this city, eat wherever you like, as much as you please, but pass through the gates in humility and say: 'May our sins be forgiven.'
We shall forgive your trespasses and give those who do good abundance.
But the wicked changed and perverted the word We had spoken to a word distorted, and We sent from heaven retribution on the wicked, for they disobeyed.
And remember, when Moses asked for water for his people, We told him to strike the rock with his staff, and behold, twelve springs of gushing water gushed forth so that each of the tribes came to know its place of drinking.
Eat and drink, (enjoy) God's gifts, and spread no discord in the land.
Remember, when you said: "O Moses, we are tired of eating the same food (day after day), ask your Lord to give us fruits of the earth, herbs and cucumbers, grains and lentils and onions;" he said: "Would you rather exchange what is good with what is bad?
Go then to the city, you shall have what you ask."
So they were disgraced and became indigent, earning the anger of God, for they disbelieved the word of God, and slayed the prophets unjustly, for they transgressed and rebelled.
Surely the believers and the Jews, Nazareans and the Sabians, whoever believes in God and the Last Day, and whosoever does right, shall have his reward with his Lord and will neither have fear nor regret.
Remember the day We made the covenant with you and exalted you on the Mount and said: "Hold fast to what We have given you, and remember what is therein that you may take heed."
But you went back (on your word), and but for the mercy and grace of God you were lost.
You know and have known already those among you who had broken the sanctity of the Sabbath, and to whom We had said: "Become (like) apes despised,"
And whom We made an example for the people (of the day) and those after them, and warning for those who fear God.
Remember, when Moses said to his people: "God demands that you sacrifice a cow," they said: "Are you making fun of us?"
And he said: "God forbid that I be of the ignorant."
"Call on your Lord for us," they said, "that He might inform us what kind she should be."
"Neither old nor young, says God, but of age in between," answered Moses.
"So do as you are bid."
"Call on your Lord," they said, "to tell us the colour of the cow."
"God says," answered Moses, "a fawn coloured cow, rich yellow, well pleasing to the eye."
"Call on your Lord," they said, "to name its variety, as cows be all alike to us.
If God wills we shall be guided aright."
And Moses said: "He says it's a cow unyoked, nor worn out by ploughing or watering the fields, one in good shape with no mark or blemish."
"Now have you brought us the truth," they said; and then, after wavering, they sacrificed the cow.
Remember when you killed a man and blamed each other for the deed, God brought to light what you concealed.
We had pronounced already: "Slay (the murderer) for (taking a life)."
Thus God preserves life from death and shows you His signs that you may understand.
Yet, in spite of this, your hearts only hardened like rocks or even harder, but among rocks are those from which rivers flow; and there are also those which split open and water gushes forth; as well as those that roll down for fear of God.
And God is not negligent of all that you do.
How do you expect them to put their faith in you, when you know that some among them heard the word of God and, having understood, perverted it knowingly?
For when they meet the faithful, they say: "We believe;" but when among themselves, they say: "Why do you tell them what the Lord has revealed to you? They will only dispute it in the presence of your Lord.
Have you no sense indeed?"
Do they not know that God is aware of what they hide and what they disclose?
Among them are heathens who know nothing of the Book but only what they wish to believe, and are only lost in fantasies.
But woe to them who fake the Scriptures and say: "This is from God," so that they might earn some profit thereby; and woe to them for what they fake, and woe to them for what they earn from it!
Yet they say: "The Fire will not touch us for more than a few days."
Say.. "Have you so received a promise from God?"
"Then surely God will not withdraw His pledge. Or do you impute things to God of which you have no knowledge at all?"
Why, they who have earned the wages of sin and are enclosed in error, are people of Hell, where they will abide for ever.
But those who believe and do good deeds are people of Paradise, and shall live there forever.
Remember, when We made a covenant with the people of Israel and said: "Worship no one but God, and be good to your parents and your kin, and to orphans and the needy, and speak of goodness to men; observe your devotional obligations, and give zakat (the due share of your wealth for the welfare of others)," you went back (on your word), except only a few, and paid no heed.
And remember, when We made a covenant with you whereby you agreed you will neither shed blood among you nor turn your people out of their homes, you promised, and are witness to it too.
But you still kill one another, and you turn a section of your people from their homes, assisting one another against them with guilt and oppression.
Yet when they are brought to you as captives you ransom them, although forbidden it was to drive them away.
Do you, then, believe a part of the Book and reject a part?
There is no other award for them who so act but disgrace in the world, and on the Day of Judgement the severest of punishment; for God is not heedless of all that you do.
They are those who bought the life of the world at the cost of the life to come; and neither will their torment decrease nor help reach them.
Remember We gave Moses the Book and sent after him many an apostle; and to Jesus, son of Mary, We gave clear evidence of the truth, reinforcing him with divine grace.
Even so, when a messenger brought to you what did not suit your mood you turned haughty, and called some imposters and some others you slew.
And they say: "Our hearts are enfolded in covers."
In fact God has cursed them for their unbelief; and only a little do they believe.
And when the Book was sent to them by God verifying what had been revealed to them already even though before it they used to pray for victory over the unbelievers and even though they recognised it when it came to them, they renounced it.
The curse of God be on those who deny!
They bartered their lives ill denying the revelation of God out of spite that God should bestow His grace among His votaries on whomsoever He will, and thus earned wrath upon wrath.
The punishment for disbelievers is ignominious.
And when it is said to them: "believe in what God has sent down," they say: "We believe what was sent to us, and do not believe what has come thereafter," although it affirms the truth they possess already.
Say: "Why have you then been slaying God's apostles as of old, if you do believe?"
Although Moses had come to you with evidence of the truth, you chose the calf in his absence, and you transgressed.
Remember when We took your pledge and exalted you on the Mount (saying:) "Hold fast to what We have given you, firmly, and pay heed," you said: "We have heard and will not obey."
(The image of) the calf had sunk deep into their hearts on account of unbelief.
Say: "Vile is your belief if you are believers indeed!"
Tell them: "If you think you alone will abide with God to the exclusion of the rest of Mankind, in the mansions of the world to come, then wish for death if what you say is true."
But they will surely not wish for death because of what they had done in the past; and God knows the sinners well.
You will see they are covetous of life more than other men, even more than those who practise idolatry.
Each one of them desires to live a thousand years, although longevity will never save them from punishment, for God sees all they do.
Say: "Whosoever is the enemy of Gabriel who revealed the word of God to you by the dispensation of God, reaffirming what had been revealed before, and is a guidance and good news for those who believe, --
Whosoever is the enemy of God and His angels and apostles, and of Gabriel and Michael, then God is the enemy of such unbelievers."
We have sent clear signs to you, such as none can deny except those who transgress the truth.
And every time they made a pledge some of them pushed it aside, and many of them do not believe.
When a messenger was sent to them by God affirming the Books they had already received, some of them put (His message) behind their backs as if they had no knowledge of it.
And they follow what devilish beings used to chant against the authority of Solomon, though Solomon never disbelieved and only the devils denied, who taught sorcery to men, which, they said, had been revealed to the angels of Babylon, Harut and Marut, who, however, never taught it without saying: "We have been sent to deceive you, so do not renounce (your faith)."
They learnt what led to discord between husband and wife.
Yet they could not harm any one or without the dispensation of God.
And they learnt what harmed them and brought no gain.
They knew indeed whoever bought this had no place in the world to come, and that surely they had sold themselves for something that was vile. If only they had sense!
Had they come to believe instead, and taken heed for themselves, they would surely have earned from God a far better reward. If only they had sense!
Say not (to the Prophet), O Believers: "Have regard for us (ra'ina)," but "look at us (unzurna)," and obey him in what he says. Painful is the nemesis for disbelievers.
Those without faith among the people of the Book, and those who worship idols, do not wish that good should come to you from your Lord. But God chooses whom He likes for His grace; and the bounty of God is infinite.
When We cancel a message (sent to an earlier prophet) or throw it into oblivion, We replace it with one better or one similar.
Do you not know that God has power over all things?
Do you not know that God's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and that there is none to save and protect you apart from God?
Do you too, O believers, wish to question your Apostle as Moses was in the past?
But he who takes unbelief in exchange for belief only strays from the right path.
How many of the followers of the Books having once known the truth desire in their hearts, out of envy, to turn you into infidels again even after the truth has become clear to them!
But you forbear and overlook till God fulfil His plan; and God has power over all things.
Fulfil your devotional obligations and pay the zakat.
And what you send ahead of good you will find with God, for He sees all that you do ill.
And they say: "None will go to Paradise but the Jews and the Christians;" but this is only wishful thinking.
Say: "Bring the proof if you are truthful."
Only he who surrenders to God with all his heart and also does good, will find his reward with his Lord, and will have no fear or regret.
The Jews say: "The Christians are not right," and the Christians say: "The Jews are in the wrong;" yet both read the Scriptures; and this is what the unread had said too.
God alone will judge between them in their differences on the Day of Reckoning.
And who is more unjust than he who prohibits the name of God being used in His mosques, who hurries to despoil them even though he has no right to enter them except in reverence?
For them is ignominy in the world and severe punishment in the life to come.
To God belong the East and the West. Wherever you turn the glory of God is everywhere: All-pervading is He and all-knowing.
Yet they say that God has begotten a son.
May He be praised!
Indeed everything in the heavens and the earth belongs to Him, and all are obedient to God.
Creator of the heavens and the earth from nothingness, He has only to say when He wills a thing: "Be", and it is.
But those who are ignorant say: "Why does God not speak or show us a sign?"
The same question had been asked by men before them, who were like them in their hearts.
But to those who are firm in their faith We have shown Our signs already.
And We have sent you with the truth to give glad tidings and to warn. You will not be questioned about those and who are inmates of Hell.
The Jews and Christians will never be pleased with you until you follow their way.
Say: "God's guidance alone is true guidance;" for if you give in to their wishes after having received the (Book of) knowledge from God, then none will you have as friend or helper to save you.
Those to whom We have sent down the Book, and who read it as it should be read, believe in it truly; but those who deny it will be losers.
O children of Israel, remember the favours I bestowed on you, and made you exalted among the nations of the world.
Fear the day when no man will stand up for man in the least, and no ransom avail nor intercession matter nor help reach.
Remember, when his Lord tried Abraham by a number of commands which he fulfilled, God said to him: "I will make you a leader among men."
And when Abraham asked: "From my progeny too?" the Lord said: "My pledge does not include transgressors."
Remember, We made the House (of Ka'bah) a place of congregation and safe retreat, and said: "Make the spot where Abraham stood the place of worship;" and enjoined upon Abraham and Ishmael to keep Our House immaculate for those who shall walk around it and stay in it for contemplation and prayer, and for bowing in adoration.
And when Abraham said: "O Lord, make this a city of peace, and give those of its citizens who believe in God and the Last Day fruits for food," He answered: "To those will I also give a little who believe not, for a time, then drag them to Hell, a dreadful destination!"
And when Abraham was raising the plinth of the House with Ishmael, (he prayed): "Accept this from us, O Lord, for You hear and know everything;
And make us submit, O Lord, to Your will, and our progeny a people submissive to You.
Teach us the way of worship and forgive our trespasses, for You are compassionate and merciful;
And send to them, O Lord, an apostle from among them to impart Your messages to them, and teach them the Book and the wisdom, and correct them in every way; for indeed You are mighty and wise.
Who will turn away from the creed of Abraham but one dull of soul?
We made him the chosen one here in the world, and one of the best in the world to come,
(For) when his Lord said to him: "Obey," he replied: "I submit to the Lord of all the worlds."
And Abraham left this legacy to his sons, and to Jacob, and said: "O my sons, God has chosen this as the faith for you. Do not die but as those who have submitted (to God)."
Were you present at the hour of Jacob's death? "What will you worship after me?" he asked his sons, and they answered: "We shall worship your God and the God of your fathers, of Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac, the one and only God; and to Him we submit."
Those were the people, and they have passed away. Theirs the reward for what they did, as yours will be for what you do.
You will not be questioned about their deeds.
They say: "Become Jews or become Christians, and find the right way."
Say: "No.
We follow the way of Abraham the upright, who was not an idolater."
Say: "We believe in God and what has been sent down to us, and what had been revealed to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and their progeny, and that which was given to Moses and Christ, and to all other prophets by the Lord.
We make no distinction among them, and we submit to Him."
If they come to believe as you did, they will find the right path. If they turn away then they will only oppose; but God will suffice you against them, for God hears all and knows everything.
"We have taken the colouring of God; and whose shade is better than God's?
Him alone we worship."
Say: "Why do you dispute with us about God when He is equally your Lord and our Lord?
To us belong our actions, to you yours; and we are true to Him."
Or do you claim that Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and their offspring were Jews or Christians?
Say: "Have you more knowledge than God?"
Who is more wicked than he who conceals the testimony he received from God?
God is not unaware of all you do.
They were the people, and they have passed away. Theirs the reward for what they did, as yours will be for what you do.
You will not be questioned about their deeds.
The foolish will now ask and say: "What has made the faithful turn away from the Qiblah towards which they used to pray?"
Say: "To God belong the East and the West. He guides who so wills to the path that is straight."
We have made you a temperate people that you act as witness over man, and the Prophet as witness over you.
We decreed the Qiblah which you faced before that We may know who follow the Apostle and who turn away in haste. And this was a hard (test) except for those who were guided by God.
But God will not suffer your faith to go waste, for God is to men full of mercy and grace.
We have seen you turn your face to the heavens. We shall turn you to a Qiblah that will please you.
So turn towards the Holy Mosque, and turn towards it wherever you be.
And those who are recipients of the Book surely know that this is the truth from their Lord; and God is not negligent of all that you do.
Even though you bring all the proof to the people of the Book they will not face the direction you turn to, nor you theirs, nor will they follow each other's direction.
And if you follow their whims after all the knowledge that has reached you, then surely you will be among transgressors.
Those to whom We have sent down the Book know this even as they know their sons. Yet a section among them conceals the truth knowingly.
The truth is from your Lord, so be not among those who are sceptics.
Each has a goal to which he turns.
So strive towards piety and excel the others: God will bring you all together wheresoever you be. God has power over everything.
Wherever you come from turn towards the Holy Mosque: This in truth is from your Lord.
God is not negligent of all you do.
Whichever place you come from turn towards the Holy Mosque, and wherever you are, turn your faces towards it so that people may have no cause for argument against you, except such among them as are wicked.
But do not fear them, fear Me that I may accomplish My favours on you, and you may find the right way perchance.
Even as We sent a messenger from among you to convey Our messages to you and cleanse you, and teach you the Book and the wisdom, and what you did not know;
So, therefore, remember Me, and I shall remember you; and give thanks and do not be ungrateful.
O you who believe, seek courage in fortitude and prayer, for God is with those who are patient and persevere.
Do not say that those who are killed in the way of God, are dead, for indeed they are alive, even though you are not aware.
Be sure We shall try you with something of fear and hunger and loss of wealth and life and the fruits (of your labour); but give tidings of happiness to those who have patience,
Who say when assailed by adversity: "Surely we are for God, and to Him we shall return."
On such men are the blessings of God and His mercy, for they are indeed on the right path.
Truly Safa and Marwa are the symbols of God. Whoever goes on pilgrimage to the House (of God), or on a holy visit, is not guilty of wrong if he walk around them; and he who does good of his own accord will find appreciation with God who knows everything.
They who conceal Our signs and the guidance We have sent them and have made clear in the Book, are condemned of God and are condemned by those who are worthy of condemning.
But those who repent and reform and proclaim (the truth), are forgiven, for I am forgiving and merciful.
But those who deny, and die disbelieving, bear the condemnation of God and the angels and that of all men,
Under which they will live, and their suffering will neither decrease nor be respite for them.
Your God is one God; there is no god other than He, the compassionate, ever-merciful.
Creation of the heavens and the earth, alternation of night and day, and sailing of ships across the ocean with what is useful to man, and the rain that God sends from the sky enlivening the earth that was dead, and the scattering of beasts of all kinds upon it, and the changing of the winds, and the clouds which remain obedient between earth and sky, are surely signs for the wise.
And yet there are men who take others as compeers of God, and bestow on them love due to God; but the love of the faithful for God is more intense.
If only the wicked could see now the agony that they will behold (on the Day of Resurrection), they will know that to God belongs the power entirely'. And the punishment of God is severe.
When those who were followed will disclaim those who followed them, and see the torment all ties between them shall be severed,
And the followers will say: "Could we live but once again we would leave them as they have abandoned us now."
God will show them thus their deeds, and fill them with remorse; but never shall they find release from the Fire.
O men, eat only the things of the earth that are lawful and good. Do not walk in the footsteps of Satan, your acknowledged enemy.
He will ask you to indulge in evil, indecency, and to speak lies of God you cannot even conceive.
When it is said to them: "Follow what God has revealed," they reply: "No, we shall follow only what our fathers had practiced," -- even though their fathers had no wisdom or guidance!
The semblance of the infidels is that of a man who shouts to one that cannot hear more than a call and a cry.
They are deaf, dumb and blind, and they fail to understand.
O believers, eat what is good of the food We have given you, and be grateful to God, if indeed you are obedient to Him.
Forbidden to you are carrion and blood, and the flesh of the swine, and that which has been consecrated (or killed) in the name of any other than God.
If one is obliged by necessity to eat it without intending to transgress, or reverting to it, he is not guilty of sin; for God is forgiving and kind.
Those who conceal any part of the Scriptures that God has revealed, and thus make a little profit thereby, take nothing but fire as food; and God will not turn to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor nourish them for growth; and their doom will be painful.
They are those who bartered away good guidance for error, and pardon for punishment: How great is their striving for the Fire
That is because God has revealed the Book containing the truth; but those who are at variance about it have gone astray in their contrariness.
Piety does not lie in turning your face to East or West: Piety lies in believing in God, the Last Day and the angels, the Scriptures and the prophets, and disbursing your wealth out of love for God among your kin and the orphans, the wayfarers and mendicants, freeing the slaves, observing your devotional obligations, and in paying the zakat and fulfilling a pledge you have given, and being patient in hardship, adversity, and times of peril. These are the men who affirm the truth, and they are those who follow the straight path.
O believers, ordained for you is retribution for the murdered, (whether) a free man (is guilty) of (the murder of) a free man, or a slave of a slave, or a woman of a woman.
But he who is pardoned some of it by his brother should be dealt with equity, and recompense (for blood) paid with a grace.
This is a concession from your Lord and a kindness.
He who transgresses in spite of it shall suffer painful punishment.
In retribution there is life (and preservation).
O men of sense, you may haply take heed for yourselves.
It is ordained that when any one of you nears death, and he owns goods and chattels, he should bequeath them equitably to his parents and next of kin.
This is binding on those who are upright and fear God.
And any one who changes the will, having heard it, shall be guilty and accountable; for God hears all and knows everything.
He who suspects wrong or partiality on the part of the testator and brings about a settlement, does not incure any guilt, for God is verily forgiving and merciful.
O believers, fasting is enjoined on you as it was on those before you, so that you might become righteous.
Fast a (fixed) number of days, but if someone is ill or is travelling (he should complete) the number of days (he had missed); and those who find it hard to fast should expiate by feeding a poor person.
For the good they do with a little hardship is better for men.
And if you fast it is good for you, if you knew.
Ramadan is the month in which the Qur'an was revealed as guidance to man and clear proof of the guidance, and criterion (of falsehood and truth).
So when you see the new moon you should fast the whole month; but a person who is ill or travelling (and fails to do so) should fast on other days, as God wishes ease and not hardship for you, so that you complete the (fixed) number (of fasts), and give glory to God for the guidance, and be grateful.
When My devotees enquire of you about Me, I am near, and answer the call of every supplicant when he calls.
It behoves them to hearken to Me and believe in Me that they may follow the right path.
You are allowed to sleep with your wives on the nights of the fast: They are your dress as you are theirs.
God is aware you were cheating yourselves, so He turned to you and pardoned you.
So now you may have intercourse with them, and seek what God has ordained for you.
Eat and drink until the white thread of dawn appears clear from the dark line, then fast until the night falls; and abstain from your wives (when you have decided) to stay in the mosques for assiduous devotion.
These are the bounds fixed by God, so keep well within them.
So does God make His signs clear to men that they may take heed for themselves.
And do not consume each other's wealth in vain, nor offer it to men in authority with intent of usurping unlawfully and knowingly a part of the wealth of others.
They ask you of the new moons.
Say: "These are periods set for men (to reckon) time, and for pilgrimage."
Piety does not lie in entering the house through the back door, for the pious man is he who follows the straight path.
Enter the house through the main gate, and obey God.
You may haply find success.
Fight those in the way of God who fight you, but do not be aggressive: God does not like aggressors.
And fight those (who fight you) wheresoever you find them, and expel them from the place they had turned you out from. Oppression is worse than killing.
Do not fight them by the Holy Mosque unless they fight you there.
If they do, then slay them: Such is the requital for unbelievers.
But if they desist, God is forgiving and kind.
Fight them till sedition comes to end, and the law of God (prevails).
If they desist, then cease to be hostile, except against those who oppress.
(Fighting during) the holy month (if the sanctity) of the holy month (is violated) is (just) retribution. So if you are oppressed, oppress those who oppress you to the same degree, and fear God, and know that God is with those who are pious and follow the right path.
Spend in the way of God, and do not seek destruction at your own hands.
So do good for God loves those who do good.
Perform the pilgrimage and holy visit ('Umra, to Makkah) in the service of God.
But if you are prevented, send an offering which you can afford as sacrifice, and do not shave your heads until the offering has reached the place of sacrifice.
But if you are sick or have ailment of the scalp (preventing the shaving of hair), then offer expiation by fasting or else giving alms or a sacrificial offering.
When you have security, then those of you who wish to perform the holy visit along with the pilgrimage, should make a sacrifice according to their means.
But he who has nothing, should fast for three days during the pilgrimage and seven on return, completing ten.
This applies to him whose family does not live near the Holy Mosque.
Have fear of God, and remember that God is severe in punishment.
Known are the months of pilgrimage. If one resolves to perform the pilgrimage in these months, let him not indulge in concupiscence, sin or quarrel.
And the good you do shall be known to God.
Provide for the journey, and the best of provisions is piety.
O men of understanding, obey Me.
It is no sin to seek the favours of your Lord (by trading).
When you start from 'Arafat in a concourse, remember God at the monument that is sacred (al-Mash'ar al-haram), and remember Him as He has shown you the way, for in the olden days you we're a people astray.
Then move with the crowd impetuously, and pray God to forgive you your sins.
God is surely forgiving and kind.
When you have finished the rites and ceremonies, remember God as you do your fathers, in fact with a greater devotion.
There are some who say: "Give us, O Lord, in the world;" but they will forego their share in the life to come.
But some there are who pray: "Give us of good in the world, O Lord, and give us of good in the life to come, and suffer us not to suffer the torment of Hell."
They are those who will surely have their share of whatsoever they have earned; for God is swift at the reckoning.
Remember God during the stated days; but if a person comes away after two days, it will not be a sin; and if one tarries, he will not transgress, if he keep away from evil.
Follow the law of God, and remember that you will have to gather before Him in the end.
There is a man who talks well of the world to your pleasing, and makes God witness to what is in his heart, yet he is the most contentious;
For when his back is turned he goes about spreading disorder in the land, destroying fields and flocks; but God does not love disorder.
Whenever he is told: "Obey God," his arrogance leads him to more sin; and sufficient for him shall be Hell: How evil a place of wide expanse!
And there is a man who is willing to sell even his soul to win the favour of God; and God is compassionate to His creatures.
O believers, come to full submission to God.
Do not follow in the footsteps of Satan your acknowledged foe.
If you falter even after Our signs have reached you, then do not forget that God is all-powerful and all-wise.
Are they waiting for God to appear in the balconies of clouds with a host of angels, and the matter to be settled?
But all things rest with God in the end.
Ask the children of Israel how many a clear sign We had given them.
But if one changes the favour of God after having received it, then remember, God is severe in revenge.
Enamoured are the unbelievers of the life of this world, and scoff at the faithful.
But those who keep from evil and follow the straight path will have a higher place than they on the Day of Reckoning; for God gives in measure without number whomsoever He will.
Men belonged to a single community, and God sent them messengers to give them happy tidings and warnings, and sent the Book with them containing the truth to judge between them in matters of dispute; but only those who received it differed after receiving clear proofs, on account of waywardness (and jealousies) among them. Then God by His dispensation showed those who believed the way to the truth about which they were differing; for God shows whom He please the path that is straight.
Do you think you will find your way to Paradise even though you have not known what the others before you have gone through?
They had suffered affliction and loss, and were shaken and tossed about so that even the Apostle had to cry out with his followers: "When will the help of God arrive?"
Remember, the help of God is ever at hand.
They ask you of what they should give in charity.
Tell them: "What you can spare of your wealth as should benefit the parents, the relatives, the orphans, the needy, the wayfarers, for God is not unaware of the good deeds that you do."
Enjoined on you is fighting, and this you abhor.
You may dislike a thing yet it may be good for you; or a thing may haply please you but may be bad for you.
Only God has knowledge, and you do not know.
They ask you of war in the holy month.
Tell them: "To fight in that month is a great sin.
But a greater sin in the eyes of God is to hinder people from the way of God, and not to believe in Him, and to bar access to the Holy Mosque and turn people out of its precincts; and oppression is worse than killing.
They will always seek war against you till they turn you away from your faith, if they can.
But those of you who turn back on their faith and die disbelieving will have wasted their deeds in this world and the next.
They are inmates of Hell, and shall there abide for ever.
Surely those who believe, and those who leave their homes and fight in the way of God, may hope for His benevolence, for God is forgiving and kind.
They ask you of (intoxicants,) wine and gambling.
Tell them: "There is great enervation though profit in them for men; but their enervation is greater than benefit.
And they ask you what they should give.
Tell them: "The utmost you can spare."
So does God reveal His signs: You may haply reflect
On this world and the next. And they ask you about the orphans. Tell them: "Improving their lot is much better; and if you take interest in their affairs, they are your brethren; and God is aware who are corrupt and who are honest; and if He had pleased He could surely have imposed on you hardship, for God is all-powerful and all-wise.
Do not marry idolatrous women unless they join the faith.
A maid servant who is a believer is better than an idolatress even though you may like her.
And do not marry your daughters to idolaters until they accept the faith.
A servant who is a believer is better than an idolater even though you may like him.
They invite you to Hell, but God calls you to Paradise and pardon by His grace. And He makes His signs manifest that men may haply take heed.
They ask you about menstruation.
Tell them: "This is a period of stress.
So keep away from women in this state till they are relieved of it. When they are free of it, you may go to them as God has enjoined.
For God loves those who seek pardon, and those who are clean."
Women are like fields for you; so seed them as you intend, but plan the future in advance.
And fear God, and remember, you have to face Him in the end.
So convey glad tidings to those who believe.
Do not implicate God in your oaths to avoid doing good and being pious and keeping peace among men, for God hears all and knows everything.
God will not call you to account for that which is senseless in your oaths, but only for what is in your hearts; for God is forgiving and forbearing.
Those who swear to keep away from their wives (with intent of divorcing them) have four months of grace; then if they reconcile (during this period), surely God is forgiving and kind.
And if they are bent on divorce, God hears all and knows everything.
Women who are divorced have to wait for three monthly periods, and if they believe in God and the Last Day they must not hide unlawfully what God has formed within their wombs.
Their husbands would do well to take them back in that case, if they wish to be reconciled.
Women also have recognised rights as men have, though men have an edge over them.
But God is all-mighty and all-wise.
Divorce is (revokable) two times (after pronouncement), after which (there are two ways open for husbands), either (to) keep (the wives) honourably, or part with them in a decent way.
You are not allowed to take away the least of what you have given your wives, unless both of you fear that you would not be able to keep within the limits set by God.
If you fear you cannot maintain the bounds fixed by God, there will be no blame on either if the woman redeems herself.
Do not exceed the limits of God, for those who exceed the bounds set by God are transgressors.
If a man divorces her again (a third time), she becomes unlawful for him (and he cannot remarry her) until she has married another man.
Then if he divorces her there is no harm if the two unite again if they think they will keep within the bounds set by God and made clear for those who understand.
When you have divorced your wives, and they have reached the end of the period of waiting, then keep them honourably (by revoking the divorce), or let them go with honour, and do not detain them with the intent of harassing lest you should transgress.
He who does so will wrong himself.
Do not mock the decrees of God, and remember the favours God has bestowed on you, and revealed to you the Book and the Law to warn you of the consequences of doing wrong.
Have fear of God, and remember, God is cognisant of everything.
When you have divorced your wives and they have completed the fixed term (of waiting), do not stop them from marrying other men if it is agreed between them honourably.
This warning is for those among you who believe in God and the Last Day.
This is both proper and right for you, for God knows and you do not know.
The mothers should suckle their babies for a period of two years for those (fathers) who wish that they should complete the suckling, in which case they should feed them and clothe them in a befitting way; but no soul should be compelled beyond capacity, neither the mother made to suffer for the child nor the father for his offspring.
The same holds good for the heir of the father (if he dies).
If they wish to wean the child by mutual consent there is no harm.
And if you wish to engage a wet nurse you may do so if you pay her an agreed amount as is customary.
But fear God, and remember that God sees all that you do.
Wives of men who die among you should wait (after their husbands death) for four months and ten days; and when the term is over there is no sin if they do what they like with themselves honourably, for God is aware of all that you do.
There is no harm in proposing in secret to (any of) these women, or keeping the intention to yourself: God is aware that you will keep them in mind. Yet do not make a promise in secret, unless you speak in a manner that is proper; and do not resolve upon marriage till the fixed term of waiting is over. Remember that God knows what is in your hearts; so be fearful of Him, and remember that God is forgiving and forbearing.
There is no sin in divorcing your wives before the consummation of marriage or settling the dowry; but then provide adequately for them, the affluent according to their means, the poor in accordance with theirs as is befitting.
This is surely the duty of those who do good.
And if you divorce them before the consummation of marriage, but after settling the dowry, then half the settled dowry must be paid, unless the woman forgoes it, or the person who holds the bond of marriage pays the full amount.
And if the man pays the whole, it is nearer to piety.
But do not forget to be good to each other, and remember that God sees all that you do.
Be wakeful of your service of prayer, and the midmost service; and honour God by standing before Him in devotion.
If you fear (war or danger), pray while standing or on horseback; but when you have safety again remember God, for He taught you what you did not know.
Those among you about to die leaving wives behind, should bequeath a year's maintenance and lodging for them, without expelling them from home.
But if they leave (of their own accord), you will not be blamed for what they do with themselves in their own rights.
God is all-mighty and all-wise.
Making a fair provision for women who are divorced is the duty of those who are God-fearing and pious.
So does God pronounce His decrees that you may understand.
Have you never thought of men who went out of their homes as a measure of safety against death, and they were thousands, to whom God said: "Die," then restored them to life?
Indeed God bestows His blessings on men; only most men are not grateful.
Fight in the way of God, and remember that God hears all and knows everything.
Who will give a goodly loan to God which He might double many times?
For God withholds and enlarges, and to Him you will return.
Have you thought of the elders of Israel after Moses, and how they said to their apostle: "Set up a king for us, then we shall fight in the way of God?"
He replied: "This too is possible that when commanded to fight you may not fight at all."
They said: "How is it we should not fight in the way of God when we have been driven from our homes and deprived of our Sons?"
But when they were ordered to fight they turned away, except for a few; yet God knows the sinners.
And when their prophet said to them: "God has raised Saul king over you," they said: "How can he be king over us when we have greater right to kingship than he, for he does not even possess abundant wealth?" "God has chosen him in preference to you," said the prophet "and given him much more wisdom and prowess; and God gives authority to whomsoever He will: God is infinite and all-wise."
Their prophet said to them: "The sign of his kingship will be that you will come to have a heart full of peace and tranquility from your Lord and the legacy left by Moses' and Aaron's family supported by angels.
This shall be a token for you if you really believe."
When Saul led his armies, he said: "God will test you by a stream.
Whoever drinks its water will not be of me; but those who do not drink shall be on my side. The only exception will be those who scoop up a palmful of water with their hands."
And but for a few they all drank of its water.
When they had crossed it, and those who believed with him, they said: "We have no strength to combat Goliath and his forces today.
But those who believed they have to face their Lord, said: "Many a time has a small band defeated a large horde by the will of God.
God is with those who are patient (and persevere)."
And when they were facing Goliath and his hordes they prayed: "O Lord, give us endurance and steady our steps, and help us against the deniers of truth."
By the will of God they defeated them, and David killed Goliath, and God gave him kingship and wisdom, and taught him whatsoever He pleased.
If God did not make men deter one another this earth would indeed be depraved.
But gracious is God to the people of the world.
These are the messages of God.
We recite them to you in all truth, as indeed you are one of the apostles.
Of all these apostles We have favoured some over the others.
God has addressed some of them, and the stations of some have been exalted over the others.
And to Jesus, son of Mary, We gave tokens, and reinforced him with divine grace. If God had so willed those who came after them would never have contended when clear signs had come to them.
But dissensions arose, some believed, some denied.
And if God had willed they would never have fought among themselves.
But God does whatsoever He please.
O believers, expend of what We have given you before the day arrives on which there will be no barter, and no friendship or intercession matter, and those who are disbelievers will be sinners.
God: There is no god but He, the living, eternal, self-subsisting, ever sustaining.
Neither does somnolence affect Him nor sleep.
To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth: and who can intercede with Him except by His leave?
Known to Him is all that is present before men and what is hidden (in time past and time future), and not even a little of His knowledge can they grasp except what He will.
His seat extends over heavens and the earth, and He tires not protecting them: He alone is all high and supreme.
There is no compulsion in matter of faith.
Distinct is the way of guidance now from error.
He who turns away from the forces of evil and believes in God, will surely hold fast to a handle that is strong and unbreakable, for God hears all and knows everything.
God is the friend of those who believe, and leads them out of darkness into light; but the patrons of infidels are idols and devils who lead them from light into darkness. They are the residents of Hell, and will there for ever abide.
Have you thought of the man who argued with Abraham about his Lord because God had given him a kingdom?
When Abraham said: "My Lord is the giver of life and death," he replied: "I am the giver of life and death."
And Abraham said: "God makes the sun rise from the East; so you make it rise from the West," and dumbfounded was the infidel.
God does not guide those who are unjust.
Or take the man who passed by a town which lay destroyed upside down.
He said: "How can God restore this city now that it is destroyed?"
So God made him die for a hundred years, then brought him back to life, and inquired: "How long did you stay in this state?"
"A day or less than a day," he replied.
"No," He said, "you were dead a hundred years, yet look at your victuals, they have not decomposed; and look at your ass!
We shall make you a warning for men.
And regard the bones, how We raise them and clothe them with flesh."
When this became clear to him, the man said: "Indeed God has power over all things."
Remember, when Abraham said: "O Lord, show me how you raise the dead," He said: "What! Do you not believe?"
"I do," answered Abraham.
"I only ask for my heart's assurance."
(The Lord) said: "Trap four birds and tame them, then put each of them on a (separate) hill, and call them, and they will come flying to you.
Know that God is all-powerful and all-wise."
The semblance of those who expend their wealth in the way of God is that of a grain of corn from which grow seven ears, each ear containing a hundred grains.
Truly God increases for whomsoever He will, for God is infinite and all-wise.
Those who spend in the way of God, and having spent do not boast or give pain (by word or deed), will get their reward from their Lord, and will neither have fear nor regret.
Saying a word that is kind, and forgiving is better than charity that hurts. (Do not forget that) God is affluent and kind.
O believers, do not nullify your charity by giving to oblige and flaunting (your favours) like a man who spends of his wealth only to show off, but does not believe in God and the Last Day.
His semblance is that of a rock covered with earth which is washed away by rain exposing the hard rock bare.
So they gain nothing from their earnings. God does not guide a people who do not believe.
But the semblance of those who expend their wealth to please God with firm and resolute hearts, is like a garden on a height on which the rain falls and it yields its fruits twice as much; and even if the rain does not fall the dew will suffice.
For God sees all that you do.
Does any of you wish to have an orchard full of date-palm trees and vines, and streams of running water and fruits of all kinds, and then old age should overtake him while his children are small, and a scorching whirlwind should smite and burn it down?
Thus God makes His signs clear to you that you may reflect.
O believers, give in charity what is good of the things you have earned, and of what you produce from the earth; and do not choose to give what is bad as alms, that is, things you would not like to accept yourself except with some condescension. Remember that God is affluent and praiseworthy.
Satan threatens you with want, and orders you (to commit) shameful acts. But God promises His pardon and grace, for God is bounteous and all-knowing.
He gives wisdom to whomsoever He please; and those who are bestowed wisdom get good in abundance. Yet none remembers this save men of wisdom.
Whatsoever you give away in alms or vow as offering, is all known to God; but the wicked will have none to help them.
If you give alms openly, it is well; but if you do it secretly and give to the poor, that is better. This will absolve you of some of your sins; and God is cognisant of all you do.
It is not for you to guide them: God guides whom He will.
Whatever you spend you will do so for yourself, for you will do so to seek the way that leads to God; and what you spend in charity you will get back in full, and no wrong will be done to you.
(Give to) the needy who are engaged in the service of God who are not able to move about in the land, whom the ignorant consider to be affluent as they refrain from asking.
You can know them from their faces for they do not ask of men importunately.
God is surely cognisant of good things that you spend.
Those who spend of their wealth in the way of God, day and night, in secret or openly, have their reward with their Lord, and have nothing to fear or regret.
Those who live on usury will not rise (on Doomsday) but like a man possessed of the devil and demented.
This because they say that trading is like usury.
But trade has been sanctioned and usury forbidden by God.
Those who are warned by their Lord and desist will keep (what they have taken of interest) already, and the matter will rest with God.
But those who revert to it again are the residents of Hell where they will abide for ever.
God takes away (gain) from usury, but adds (profit) to charity; and God does not love the ungrateful and sinners.
Those who believe and do good deeds, and fulfil their devotional obligations and pay the zakat, have their reward with their Lord, and will have neither fear nor regret.
O believers, fear God and forego the interest that is owing, if you really believe.
If you do not, beware of war on the part of God and His Apostle.
But if you repent, you shall keep your principal. Oppress none and no one will oppress you.
If a debtor is in want, give him time until his circumstances improve; but if you forego (the debt) as charity, that will be to your good, if you really understand.
Have fear of the day when you go back to God.
Then each will be paid back in full his reward, and no one will be wronged.
O believers, when you negotiate a debt for a fixed term, draw up an agreement in writing, though better it would be to have a scribe write it faithfully down; and no scribe should refuse to write as God has taught him, and write what the borrower dictates, and have fear of God, his Lord, and not leave out a thing.
If the borrower is deficient of mind or infirm, or unable to explain, let the guardian explain judiciously; and have two of your men to act as witnesses; but if two men are not available, then a man and two women you approve, so that in case one of them is confused the other may prompt her.
When the witnesses are summoned they should not refuse (to come).
But do not neglect to draw up a contract, big or small, with the time fixed for paying back the debt.
This is more equitable in the eyes of God, and better as evidence and best for avoiding doubt.
But if it is a deal about some merchandise requiring transaction face to face, there is no harm if no (contract is drawn up) in writing.
Have witnesses to the deal, (and make sure) that the scribe or the witness is not harmed.
If he is, it would surely be sinful on your part.
And have fear of God, for God gives you knowledge, and God is aware of everything.
If you are on a journey and cannot find a scribe, pledge your goods (against the Loan); and if one trusts the other, then let him who is trusted deliver the thing entrusted, and have fear of God, his Lord. Do not suppress any evidence, for he who conceals evidence is sinful of heart; and God is aware of all you do.
To God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth; and whether you reveal what is in your heart or conceal it, you will have to account for it to God who will pardon whom He please and punish whom He will, for God has the power over all things.
The Prophet believes in what has been revealed to him by his Lord, and so do the faithful. Each one believes in God and His angels, His Books and the prophets, and We make no distinction between the apostles.
For they say: "We hear and obey, and we seek Your forgiveness, O Lord, for to You we shall journey in the end."
God does not burden a soul beyond capacity.
Each will enjoy what (good) he earns, as indeed each will suffer from (the wrong) he does.
Punish us not, O Lord, if we fail to remember or lapse into error.
Burden us not, O Lord, with a burden as You did those before us.
Impose not upon us a burden, O Lord, we cannot carry.
Overlook our trespasses and forgive us, and have mercy upon us; You are our Lord and Master, help us against the clan of unbelievers.
ALIF LAM MIM.
God: there is no god but He, the living, eternal, self-subsisting, ever sustaining.
He has verily revealed to you this Book, in truth and confirmation of the Books revealed before, as indeed He had revealed the Torah and the Gospel
Before this as guidance for men, and has sent the criterion (of falsehood and truth).
As for those who deny the signs of God, the punishment is severe; for God is all powerful and great His requital.
There is nothing in the earth and the heavens that is hidden from God.
He shapes you in the womb of the mother as He wills.
There is no god but He, the all-mighty and all-wise.
He has sent down this Book which contains some verses that are categorical and basic to the Book, and others allegorical. But those who are twisted of mind look for verses metaphorical, seeking deviation and giving to them interpretations of their own; but none knows their meaning except God; and those who are steeped in knowledge affirm: "We believe in them as all of them are from the Lord." But only those who have wisdom understand.
"Let us not go astray, O Lord, having guided us already.
Bestow on us Your blessings for You are the benevolent.
You will gather mankind together, O Lord, on a day that is certain to come, and God does not fail in His promise.
As for those who deny, neither their wealth nor their children will help them in the least against God.
They shall be but faggots for (the fire of) Hell,
Like the people of the Pharaoh, and those before them, who rejected Our signs, and were punished for their sins by God; and the punishment of God is severe.
So tell the disbelievers: "You will surely be subdued and driven to Hell: How bad a preparation!"
There was a token for you in the two armies which clashed (in the battle of Badr), one fighting for God, the other of unbelievers who saw with their own eyes the faithful to be two times as many as they, for God reinforces with His help whomsoever He will.
In this is a lesson for those who have eyes.
Enamoured are the people of the lust of (earthly) pleasures, of women and of children and hoarded heaps of gold and silver, well-bred horses, and tilled land and cattle, all (vain) goods and chattels of the life of this world, while the best of abodes is with God.
Say: "Shall I tell you of (things) even better?
With the Lord are gardens with running streams of water for those who keep from evil and follow the straight path, where they will live unchanged with the purest of companions and blessings of God."
And under God's eyes are devotees
who say: "O Lord, we believe; forgive our trespasses and save us the torment of Hell."
They are the patient, the sincere and devout, full of charity, who pray for forgiveness in the hours of dawn.
God is witness there is no god but He, and so are the angels and men full of learning. He is the upholder of justice.
There is no god but He, the mighty and all-wise.
The true way with God is peace; and the people of the Book did not differ until knowledge (of this revelation) had come to them, out of mutual opposition.
But those who deny the signs of God (should remember) He is swift in the reckoning.
Even then if they argue, tell them: "I have bowed in submission to God, and so have my followers."
And tell the people of the Book and the Arabs: "Do you submit?"
If they do, they will find the right path; if they turn away, your duty is to deliver the message.
And God keeps an eye on His votaries.
To those who deny the signs of God, and slay the apostles unjustly, and slay the upholders of justice, give news of painful punishment.
Their good deeds will be wasted in this world and in the next, and none will they have to help them.
Have you not seen the people who have received a part of Revelation who are called to the Book of God that it may judge (in their disputes) between them?
But some, being averse turn away,
For they say: "The Fire will not touch us for more than a few days."
They have been deceived by the lies they have themselves fabricated, and stray from their faith.
How shall it be when We gather them together on a day that is certain to come, when each will receive his reward without (favour or) wrong?
Say: "O Lord of all dominions, You give whom it pleases You the kingdom, and You take away the power from whosoever You will; You exalt whom You please and debase whom You will.
All goodness is Yours (entirely). Indeed You have the power over all things.
You make the night succeed the day, the day succeed the night, raise the living from the dead, the dead from the living, and give whomsoever You please, and in measure without number."
Those who believe should not take unbelievers as their friends in preference to those who believe -- and whoever does so should have no (expectations) of God -- unless to safeguard yourselves against them.
But God commands you to beware of Him, for to God you will journey in the end.
Say: "Whether you conceal or reveal whatsoever is in your hearts it is all known to God, as is known to Him all that is in the heavens and the earth; and God has the power over all things."
On the day when every man will find whatever of good he has earned and of evil, and is confronted with it, he shall wish that a distance appeared between him and that day -- (that it were far away).
God bids you beware of Him, though compassionate is God to His votaries.
Say: "If you love God then follow me that God may love you and forgive your faults; for God is forgiving and kind."
Say: "Obey God and His Messenger;" and if they refuse (then remember) God does not love disbelievers.
God had chosen Adam and Noah and the families of Abraham and 'Imran in preference to others.
They were descendants of one another; and God hears all and knows everything.
Remember, when the wife of 'Imran prayed: "O Lord, I offer what I carry in my womb in dedication to Your service, accept it, for You hear all and know everything."
And when she had given birth to the child, she said: "O Lord, I have delivered but a girl." -- But God knew better what she had delivered: A boy could not be as that girl was.
"I have named her Mary," (she said), "and I give her into Your keeping. Preserve her and her children from Satan the ostracized."
Her Lord accepted her graciously, and she grew up with excellence, and was given into the care of Zachariah.
Whenever Zachariah came to see her in the chamber, he found her provided with food, and he asked: "Where has this come from, O Mary?"
And she said: "From God who gives food in abundance to whomsoever He will."
Then prayed Zachariah to his Lord: "O Lord, bestow on me offspring, virtuous and good, for You answer all prayers."
Then the angels said to him as he stood in the chamber at prayer: "God sends you good tidings of John who will confirm a thing from God and be noble, continent, and a prophet, and one of those who are upright and do good."
"How can I have a son, O Lord," he said, "for I am old and my wife is barren?"
"Thus," came the answer, "God does as He wills."
And Zachariah said: "Give me a token, O Lord."
"The token will be," was the reply, "that you will speak to no man for three days except by signs; and remember your Lord much, and pray at evening and sunrise."
The angels said: "O Mary, indeed God has favoured you and made you immaculate, and chosen you from all the women of the world.
So adore your Lord, O Mary, and pay homage and bow with those who bow in prayer."
This is news of the Unknown that We send you, for you were not there when they cast lots with quills (to determine) who should take care of Mary, nor when they disputed it.
When the angels said: "O Mary, God gives you news of a thing from Him, for rejoicing, (news of one) whose name will be Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, illustrious in this world and the next, and one among the honoured,
Who will speak to the people when in the cradle and when in the prime of life, and will be among the upright and doers of good."
She said: "How can I have a son, O Lord, when no man has touched me?"
He said: "That is how God creates what He wills. When He decrees a thing, He says 'Be', and it is.
He will teach him the Law and the judgement, and the Torah and the Gospel,
And he will be Apostle to the children of Israel, (saying:) 'I have come to you with a prodigy from your Lord that I will fashion the state of destiny out of mire for you, and breathe (a new spirit) into it, and (you) will rise by the will of God.
I will heal the blind and the leper, and infuse life into the dead, by the leave of God. I will tell you what you devour and what you hoard in your homes.
In this will be a portent for you if you do believe.
I (have come to) confirm the truth of the Torah which was sent down before me, and make certain things lawful which have been forbidden until now; and I come to you with a sign from your Lord; so be fearful of God and follow me.
Surely God is my Lord, and your Lord, so worship Him; and this is the right path.
When Jesus perceived their unbelief he asked: "Who will help me in the way of God?"
"We," the disciples answered, "shall be the helpers of God. We believe in God; and you be our witness that we submit and obey.
"O Lord, we believe in Your revelations and follow this Apostle.
Enroll us among the witnesses."
But they (the unbelievers) contrived a plot, and God did the like; and God's plan is the best.
When God said: "O Jesus, I will take you to Myself and exalt you, and rid you of the infidels, and hold those who follow you above those who disbelieve till the Day of Resurrection.
You have then to come back to Me when I will judge between you in what you were at variance."
Those who are infidels will surely receive severe punishment both in this world and the next; and none will they have to help (or save) them.
But those who believe and do good deeds shall be given their recompense in full; but God does not love the unjust.
These verses that We read to you are signs and reminder full of wisdom.
For God the likeness of Jesus is as that of Adam whom He fashioned out of dust and said "Be" and he was.
This is the truth from your Lord, so do not be in doubt.
Tell those who dispute this with you even after the knowledge that has reached you: "Come, let us gather our sons and your sons, our women and your women, ourselves and yourselves, and pray and solicit God to condemn those who lie."
And this verily is the true account. There is no god but God, and God is all-mighty and all-wise.
If they turn away (remember) God knows the mischief-mongers.
Tell them: "O people of the Book, let us come to an agreement on that which is common between us, that we worship no one but God, and make none His compeer, and that none of us take any others for lord apart from God."
If they turn away you tell them: "Bear witness that we submit to Him."
O people of the Book, why dispute about Abraham? The Torah and the Gospel were sent down after him: Do you not understand?
Remember you are those who disputed the things you knew; so wherefore dispute about things you do not know?
And God has the knowledge, while you do not know.
Neither was Abraham a Jew nor a Christian, but upright and obedient, and not an idolater.
Of all men the nearest to Abraham are those who follow him, and then this Prophet and the faithful; and God is the protector of all believers.
Some among the people of the Book wish to lead you astray, yet they lead none astray but themselves, though they do not realise.
O people of the Book, why do you disbelieve the signs of God having witnessed them yourselves?
O people of the Book, why do you mix the false with the true, and hide the truth knowingly?
A section of the people of the Book say: "Believe in the morning what has been revealed to the faithful, and deny in the evening; they might perhaps turn back;
"And do not believe those who do not belong to your faith."
Say: "True guidance is the guidance of God -- that any may be given the like of what has been given you."
Will they argue with you before your Lord? Say: "God's is the bounty.
He gives whomsoever He please, for He is infinite and all-wise."
He may choose whom He likes for His favours, for great is His bounty.
There are some among the people of the Book who return a whole treasure entrusted to them; yet some there are who do not give back a dinar until you demand and insist, because they say: "It is not a sin for us to (usurp) the rights of the Arabs."
Yet they lie against God, and they know it.
But certainly whoever keeps his promise and follows the right path (will be blessed), for God loves those who shun evil and follow the right course.
Those who trade on the promises of God, and who purchase a little gain from their oaths, will have no share in the life to come. God will not address or even regard them on the Day of Resurrection, nor perfect them, and their suffering will be painful.
Among them is a section which distorts in reading the Scripture in a way that though it sounds like the Scripture, in fact it is not; yet they say it is from God, when they know it is not; and they lie about God, and knowingly.
It is not for a mortal to whom God reveals the Book and the judgement and the prophethood to say to the people: "Be my votaries instead of God's," but (to say): "Become learned in divine law, by virtue of teaching and studying the Book."
He will surely not bid you make the angels and the prophets your lords.
Would he order you disbelief after you have submitted (and accepted the law of God)?
Remember when God covenanted the prophets (and said): "If after I have given you the Law and the judgement there comes an apostle to you who confirms the truth already with you, you will surely believe him and help him;" and asked: "Do you accept and agree to the terms of My covenant?"
They said: "We accept."
"Then you be witness," said God, "and I shall be witness with you.
Then any one who turns away will be a transgressor."
Do they seek another way than God's?
But whosoever is in the heavens and the earth is submissive to God and obedient (to Him), by choice or constraint, and will be returned to Him.
Say: "We believe in God, and in what has been revealed to us, and in what had been sent down to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and their offspring, and what had been revealed to Moses and to Jesus and to all other prophets by their Lord. We make no distinction between them, and we submit to Him and obey."
And whoever seeks a way other than submission to God, it will not be accepted from him, and he will be a loser in the world to come.
How can God show the way to those who, having come to faith, turned away, even though they had borne witness that the Messenger was true, and the clear signs had reached them?
God does not show the unrighteous the way.
For such the requital is the curse of God and the angels and of men.
They shall live under it, and none of their agony decrease nor be respite for them.
But those who repent and reform, God is surely forgiving and merciful.
Those who deny, having once come to faith, and persist in denial, will not have their repentance accepted, for they have gone astray.
From those who deny and die disbelieving will never be accepted an earthful of gold if proferred by them as ransom.
For them is grievous punishment, and none will help them.
You will never come to piety unless you spend of things you love; and whatever you spend is known to God.
To the children of Israel was lawful all food except what Israel forbade himself before the Torah was revealed.
Say: "Bring the Torah and recite it, if what you say is true."
And anyone who fabricates lies about God even after this, is wicked indeed.
Say: "God has veritably spoken the truth.
So now follow the way of Abraham the upright, who was not of idolaters."
The first House of God to be set up for men was at Bakkah the blessed, a guidance for the people of the world.
It contains clear signs, and the spot where Abraham had stood.
And anyone who enters it will find security.
And whosoever can afford should visit the House on a pilgrimage as duty to God.
Whosoever denies, should remember that God is independent of the peoples of the world.
Say: "O people of the Book, why do you reject the word of God when God is a witness to all that you do?"
Then say: "O people of the Book, why do you turn the believers away from the path of God, looking for obliquities in the way when you are witness to it?
And God is aware of all that you do."
O believers, if you follow what some of the people of the Book say, it will turn you into unbelievers even after you have come to belief.
And how can you disbelieve? To you are being recited the messages of God, and His prophet is among you.
And whosoever holds fast to God shall verily be guided to the path that is straight.
O believers, fear God as He should be feared, and do not die but submitting (to Him).
Hold on firmly together to the rope of God, and be not divided among yourselves, and remember the favours God bestowed on you when you were one another's foe and He reconciled your hearts, and you turned into brethren through His grace.
You had stood on the edge of a pit of fire and He saved you from it, thus revealing to you His clear signs that you may find the right way perchance.
So let there be a body among you who may call to the good, enjoin what is esteemed and forbid what is odious. They are those who will be successful.
So be not like those who became disunited and differed among themselves after clear proofs had come to them. For them is great suffering.
On the Day when some faces would be bright, and some others will be black (with despair), those with black faces (will be told): "Having come to the faith you denied it; now taste therefore the penalty for you disbelieved."
And those with bright faces shall be under God's grace and enjoy it for ever.
These are the commandments of God We recite to you verily; God does not wish injustice to the creatures of the world.
For to God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth, and to God do all things return.
Of all the communities raised among men you are the best, enjoining the good, forbidding the wrong, and believing in God.
If the people of the Book had come to believe it was best for them; but only some believe, and transgressors are many.
They will do you no harm but annoyance; and if they fight you they will only turn their backs, then no help will reach them.
Degraded they shall live wheresoever they be unless they make an alliance with God and alliance with men, for they have incurred the anger of God, and misery overhangs them.
That is because they denied the signs of God and killed the prophets unjustly, and rebelled, and went beyond the limit.
Yet all of them are not alike.
Among the people of the Book is a section upright, who recite the scriptures in the hours of the night and bow in adoration and pray,
And believe in God and the Last Day, and enjoin what is good and forbid what is wrong, and who hasten to give in charity: they are among the upright and the doers of good.
And the good they do will not go unaccepted; for God is aware of those who keep away from evil.
As for those who disbelieve, neither wealth nor children will avail them in the least against God. They are the residents of Hell where they will live for ever.
What they spend in the life of this world is like a frosty wind which smites and destroys the crops of a people who had wronged themselves.
God did not wrong them, they wronged themselves.
O believers, do not make others except your own people your confidants.
They will spare no effort to ruin you: They surely desire your annihilation.
Hate is on their tongues, and what they hide in their hearts is worse.
We have shown you the signs if you have sense.
Just think!
You hold them as your friends but they do not, even though you believe in all the Scriptures.
When they meet you they say: "We believe;" but when they are alone they bite their fingers in rage.
Say: "Die of your rage.
God is aware of the secrets of the hearts."
If good comes your way, they are vexed; but if evil befalls you they are pleased and rejoice; yet if you are patient and guard yourselves against evil, their cunning will not harm you in the least, for whatsoever they do is well within the reach of God.
Remember when you set forth in the morning from your house assigning the faithful positions for the battle, God heard everything and knew all.
When two of your bands were about to lose heart God befriended them; and in Him should the faithful place their trust.
For God had helped you during the Battle of Badr at a time when you were helpless. So act in compliance with the laws of God; you may well be grateful.
Remember when you said to the faithful: "Is it not sufficient that your Lord should send for your help three thousand angels from the heavens?
Indeed if you are patient and take heed for yourselves, and the (enemy) come rushing at you suddenly your Lord will send even five thousand angels on chargers sweeping down."
And God did not do so but as good tidings for you, and to reassure your hearts for victory comes from God alone, the all-mighty and all-wise --
In order that He may cut off a part of unbelievers or overthrow them, and they turn back in frustration.
You have no say in the matter if He pardon them or punish them, for they are unjust.
To God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth: He may pardon whom He please and punish whom He will. Yet God is forgiving and kind.
O you who believe, do not practice usury, charging doubled and redoubled (interest); but have fear of God: you may well attain your goal.
Keep away from the Fire prepared for the infidels;
Obey God and the Prophet, that you may be treated with mercy.
And hasten for the pardon of your Lord, and for Paradise extending over the heavens and the earth, laid out for those who take heed for themselves and fear God,
Who expend both in joy and tribulation, who suppress their anger and pardon their fellowmen; and God loves those who are upright and do good,
And those who, if they commit a shameful act or some wrong against themselves, remember God and seek forgiveness for their sins: For who can forgive except God? They should not be perverse about their doings, knowingly.
Their recompense is pardon by their Lord, and gardens with streams of running water where they will abide for ever. How fair is the recompense of those who act!
There have been many dispensations before you; so travel in the land and see what befell those who denied the truth.
This is a clear declaration for mankind, and a guidance and a warning for those who preserve themselves from evil.
So do not lose heart or be grieved, for you will surely prevail if you are believers.
If you have been wounded they too have suffered a wound.
We cause this alternation of night and day in the affairs of men so that God may know those who believe, taking some as witness (of truth) from your ranks, for God does not like those who are unjust.
This is so that God may try the faithful and destroy the unbelievers.
Do you think you will go to Paradise while God does not know who among you strive and persist?
You had wished to know death before you faced it (in battle); so now you have seen it before your own eyes.
Muhammad is only a messenger; and many a messenger has gone before him.
So what if he dies or is killed! Will you turn back and go away in haste?
But he who turns back and goes away in haste will do no harm to God. But God will reward those who give thanks (and are grateful).
No one can die before his appointed term except in accordance with the law of God.
And to him who desires a reward in this world, We shall give it; and to him who desires a reward in the life to come, We shall do that. We shall certainly reward those who are grateful.
Many a seeker after God has fought in the way of God by the side of many an apostle, undaunted (by disaster), and did not disgrace themselves; -- verily God loves those who are steadfast.
Nor did they say aught but: "O our Lord, forgive us our sins and excesses in our acts, and steady our steps, and help us against unbelieving people."
So God rewarded them in this world, and a better reward awaits them in the next; for God loves those who do good.
O believers, if you listen to the infidels they will make you turn your backs, and you will be the losers.
But God is your protector, and He is the best of helpers.
We shall strike terror into the hearts of unbelievers for ascribing compeers to God for which He has sent down no sanction. Hell is their residence, the evil abode of the unjust.
The promise made to you by God was verified when you destroyed (the foe) by His leave, until you were unmanned and disputed the order, and thus disobeyed (the Apostle) even after He had brought you in sight of (victory) you longed for.
Some of you desired this world, and some of you the next.
Then He put you to flight before (them) in order to try you.
But (now) He has forgiven you, for surely God is kind to the faithful.
Remember, as you were rushing up (the hill) without turning back to look, though the Prophet was calling you from the rear, He requited you with anguish for an anguish that you do not fret for missed opportunity and what befell you, for God is aware of all that you do,
Then after affliction He Sent you a drowsiness as comes after security, overwhelming some among you, and making some anxious for themselves, and made them think thoughts of pagan ignorance; and they said: "Have we a say in any affair?"
Say: "All affairs rest with God."
They hide in their hearts what they do not disclose to you.
They say: "If we had a say in the affair we would not have been killed in this place."
Tell them: "Even had you stayed at home, those of you who were ordained to fight would have gone to their place of (eternal) rest. God had to try them to bring out what they concealed in their breasts, and to bring out the secrets of their hearts, for God knows your innermost thoughts.
All those among you who turned their backs on the day the two armies clashed (at 'Uhud) were surely induced by Satan to fail in their duty because of their sinful deeds.
But God has already forgiven them, for God is forgiving and kind.
O you who believe, do not be like those who deny, and say of their brethren (who died) travelling in the land or fighting: "Had they stayed with us here they would not have died or been killed."
This happened so that God may fill their hearts with grief.
God is the giver of life and death and sees all that you do.
If you are killed in the cause of God or you die, the forgiveness and mercy of God are better than all that you amass.
And if you die or are killed, even so it is to God that you will return.
It was through God's mercy that you dealt with them gently; for had you been stern and hard of heart they would surely have broken away from you.
So pardon them and pray that forgiveness be theirs, and seek their counsel in all affairs, And when you have come to a decision place your trust in God alone, for He loves those who place their trust in Him.
If God is there to help you none will overcome you; and if He forsake you, who will help you other than Him?
So only in God should the faithful place their trust.
It is not for a prophet to be false; and whoever is false will indeed bring his falsehood with him on the Day of Reckoning when each will receive his reward without favour or wrong.
Is a man who has followed the pleasure of God the same as he who has incurred His wrath, whose abode is surely Hell, a dreadful place?
There are different ranks with God, And God sees everything you do.
God has favoured the faithful by sending an apostle to them from among themselves, who recites to them His messages, and reforms and teaches them the Law and the judgement, for they were clearly in error before.
How is it that when misfortune befell you, you said: "Where has this come from?" -- even though you had inflicted disaster twice as great on (the enemy).
Say: "This has come from your own selves."
Surely God has power over all things.
What you suffered on the day the two armies had met was by God's dispensation, so that He may distinguish the faithful,
And may distinguish the hypocrites who were told: "Fight in the way of God, or defend yourselves," and who had replied: "If we knew of the fight we would have followed you." They were nearer unbelief than faith on that day, and they said with their tongues what was not in their hearts; but God is aware of what they hide.
To those who sit at home and say of their brothers: "They would never have been killed had they listened to us, say: "Drive away death from your midst if what you say is true."
Never think that those who are killed in the way of God are dead. They are alive, getting succour from their Lord,
Rejoicing at what God has given them of His grace, and happy for those who are trying to overtake them but have not joined them yet, and who will have no fear or regret.
They rejoice at the kindness and mercy of God; and God does not suffer the wages of the faithful to go waste.
Those who obeyed the call of God and His Messenger, even after they were wounded, and took heed for themselves, shall indeed have an ample reward,
Those who were told: "They have gathered an army, beware," and their faith increased and they said: "God is sufficient for us, and the best of protectors,"
And returned with God's favour and grace without harm, for they attended the pleasure of God; and great is the benevolence of God.
It is no one but Satan who frightens you with his allies. But do not fear him, fear Me, if indeed you are believers.
And do not be grieved by those who rush into disbelief. They do no harm to God; and God will not give them any share in the life to come, and their torment shall be great.
Those who barter unbelief for faith, will not harm God in the least, and the punishment for them will be painful.
The unbelievers must not think that the respite We give them augurs well. We do so that they sink deeper into sin, and suffer an ignominious doom.
God will not leave the believers in the state they are in till He has sifted the evil from the good; nor will God reveal the secrets of the Unknown.
He chooses (for this) from His apostles whom He will. So believe in God and the prophets, for if you believe and fear the displeasure of God your reward will be great.
Let not those who are niggardly of things that God has given them of His largesse think that this is good for them.
In fact, it is worse; for what they grudged will be hung around their necks on the Day of Resurrection.
To God belong the heavens and the earth, and God is aware of all you do.
God has indeed heard the words of those who said: "God is a pauper whereas we are rich."
We shall make a note of their words, and the murders of the prophets they committed unjustly, and say to them: "Now taste the agony of burning."
This is (requital) for the deeds you had committed, for God is not unjust to any of His creatures.
To those who say: "God has ordained that we should not believe an apostle who does not bring burnt offerings," say: "Many an apostle had come to you before me with manifest proofs, even with what you mention; then why did you kill them if you were men of truth?"
If they call you a liar (remember) so had other apostles been called before you, who had come with clear signs and Scriptures and the Book enlightening.
Every soul will know the taste of death. You will get your recompense in full on the Day of Resurrection; and he who is spared the Fire and finds his way to Paradise will meet his desire.
As for the life of this world, it is nothing but a merchandise of vanity.
You will, nonetheless, be tried with your wealth and life, and will hear many untoward things from the followers of former Books and the infidels.
But if you endure with patience and follow the straight path, it will surely (accord) with God's fixed resolve about human affairs.
And remember when God took a promise from the people of the Book to make its (truth) known to mankind, and not keep back any part of it, they set aside (the pledge), and sold it away for a little gain but how wretched the bargain that they made!
Think not that those who exult at what they have done, and who love to be praised for what they have not done, shall escape the punishment, for grievous indeed will be their doom.
For God's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and God's is the power over all things.
In the creation of the heavens and the earth, the alternation of night and day, are signs for the wise.
Those who honour God in meditation, standing or sitting or lying on their sides, who reflect and contemplate on the creation of the heavens and the earth, (and say) "Not in vain have You made them.
All praise be to You, O Lord, preserve us from the torment of Hell.
Whoever, O Lord, should be cast into Hell shall be verily disgraced; and the sinners shall have none to help (or save) them.
We have heard, O our Lord, the crier call inviting us to faith (and announcing): 'Believe in your Lord.'
O our Lord, to faith we have come, so forgive our trespasses, deliver us from sin, and grant us (the glory of) death with the just.
Give us what You promised, O Lord, through Your prophets; and put us not to shame on the Day of Reckoning, for never do You go back on Your promise."
The Lord heard their prayer and answered: "I suffer not the good deeds of any to go waste, be he a man or a woman: The one of you is of the other.
And those who were deprived of their homes or banished in My cause, and who fought and were killed, I shall blot out their sins and admit them indeed into gardens with rippling streams." -- A recompense from God, and the best of rewards is with God.
Be not deceived by the comings and goings of unbelievers in the land.
Their commerce is but short-lived, and then their abode shall be Hell: And what an evil abode!
But those who are pious and obedient to their Lord, will have gardens with streams of running water where they will abide as guests of God; and what is with God is best for the pious.
Certainly among the people of the Book are some who believe in God and in what has been revealed to you and had been revealed to them; and they bow in humility before God, and do not trade for paltry gain the signs of God.
Their reward is verily with their Lord; and swift is the reckoning of God!
So you who believe, have endurance in suffering, be patient and persevere, strengthen each other and be firm, and be pious and fear God that you may find success.
O MEN, FEAR your Lord who created you from a single cell, and from it created its mate, and from the two of them dispersed men and women (male and female) in multitudes.
So fear God in whose name you ask of one another (the bond of) relationships.
God surely keeps watch over you.
Give to the orphans their possessions, and do not replace things of your own which are bad with things which are good among theirs, and do not intermix their goods with your own and make use of them, for this is a grievous crime.
If you fear you cannot be equitable to orphan girls (in your charge, or misuse their persons), then marry women who are lawful for you, two, three, or four; but if you fear you cannot treat so many with equity, marry only one, or a maid or captive.
This is better than being iniquitous.
Give to women their dowers willingly, but if they forego part of it themselves, then use it to your advantage.
Do not entrust (their) property God has given you to maintain (On trust), to those who are immature; but feed them and clothe them from it, and speak to them with kindness.
And test (and try) the orphans until they are of marriageable age. If you find they have acquired sound judgement, then hand over their property to them; but devour not their wealth, nor use it up hastily out of fear that soon they will grow up (and demand it).
And (the guardian) who is rich should abstain from spending much (of their wealth); and he who is poor should use only as much as is fair.
And when you give back their possessions have this witnessed, (and remember) that God is sufficient to take all account.
Men have a share in what the parents and relatives leave behind at death; and women have a share in what the parents and relatives leave behind.
Be it large or small a legal share is fixed.
And when the relatives and orphans and the needy collect at the time of the division (of property) provide for them too, and talk kindly to them.
Let people fear the day when they leave small children behind them unprovided, and how concerned they would be for them. So fear God and say the right things to them.
Those who devour the possessions of the orphans unjustly devour only fire, and will surely burn in Hell.
As for the children, God decrees that the share of the male is equivalent to that of two females.
If they consist of women only, and of them more than two, they will get two-thirds of the inheritance; but in case there is one, she will inherit one half.
The parents will each inherit a sixth of the estate if it happens the deceased has left a child; but if he has left no children, and his parents are his heirs, then the mother will inherit one-third; but if he has left brothers, the mother will inherit one-sixth after payment of legacies and debts.
Of parents and children you do not know who are more useful to you.
These are the decrees of God who knows all and is wise.
Your share in the property the wives leave behind is half if they die without an issue, but in case they have left children, then your share is one-fourth after the payment of legacies and debts; and your wife shall inherit one-fourth of what you leave at death if you die childless, if not, she will get one-eighth of what you leave behind after payment of legacies and debts.
If a man or a woman should die without leaving either children or parents behind but have brother and sister, they shall each inherit one-sixth.
In case there are more, they will share one-third of the estate after payment of legacies and debts without prejudice to others. This is the decree of God who knows all and is kind.
These are the limits set by God, and those who follow the commandments of God and the Prophet, will indeed be admitted to gardens with streams of water running by, where they will for ever abide; and this will be success supreme.
Those who disobey God and the Prophet and exceed the bounds of law, will be taken to Hell and abide there for ever and shall suffer despicable punishment.
If any of your women is guilty of unnatural offence, bring four of your witnesses to give evidence; if they testify against them, retain them in the houses until death overtakes them or God provides some other way for them.
If two (men) among you are guilty of such acts then punish both of them.
But if they repent and reform, let them be, for God accepts repentance and is merciful.
God does accept repentance, but only of those who are guilty of an evil out of ignorance yet quickly repent, and God turns to them again, for God is all-knowing and all-wise.
But (He does not accept) the repentance of those who continue indulging in evil until death draws near and they say: "We now repent;" nor of those who die disbelieving.
For them We have a grievous retribution in wait.
O believers, you are not allowed to take perforce the women (of dead relatives) into your heritage, or tyrannise over them in order to deprive them of what you have given them, unless they are guilty of open adultery.
Live with them with tolerance and justice even if you do not care for them. For it may well be you may not like a thing, yet God may have endued it with much goodness.
If you want to take another wife in place of the one you are married to, then even if you have given her a talent of gold, do not take back a thing.
Would you take it away by slandering and using unjust means?
How could you do that having slept with one another, and when they had taken a solemn pledge from you?
And do not wed the women your fathers had wed. What happened in the past is now past: It was lewd and abhorrent, and only the way of evil.
Unlawful are your mothers and daughters and your sisters to you, and the sisters of your fathers and your mothers, and the daughters of your brothers and sisters, and foster mothers, foster sisters, and the mothers of your wives, and the daughters of the wives you have slept with who are under your charge; but in case you have not slept with them there is no offence (if you marry their daughters); and the wives of your own begotten sons; and marrying two sisters is unlawful.
What happened in the past (is now past): God is forgiving and kind.
Also forbidden are married women unless they are captives (of war).
Such is the decree of God.
Lawful for you are women besides these if you seek them with your wealth for wedlock and not for debauchery.
Then give those of these women you have enjoyed, the agreed dower.
It will not be sinful if you agree to something (else) by mutual consent after having settled the dowry.
God is certainly all-knowing and all-wise.
If one of you cannot afford to marry a believing gentlewoman (let him marry) a maid who is a believer. God is aware of your faith: The one of you is of the other; so marry them with the consent of their people, and give them an appropriate dowry.
They are women (seeking) wedlock, and not lechery, nor secretly looking for paramours.
But if they are married and guilty of adultery, inflict on them half the punishment (enjoined) for gentlewomen.
This is for those who are afraid of doing wrong.
In case they can wait, it is better for them. God is forgiving and kind.
God wishes to make it clear to you and guide you through the example of earlier people, and to forgive you, for God is all-knowing and all-wise.
God likes to turn to you, but those who are lost in the pleasures of the flesh wish to turn you astray, far away.
God would like to lighten your burden, for man was created weak.
O believers, you should not usurp unjustly the wealth of each other, but trade by mutual consent; and do not destroy yourselves. God is merciful to you.
If someone does so through oppression or injustice, We shall cast him into Hell: This is how (the Law of) God works inevitably.
If you keep away from the deadly sins that have been forbidden, We shall efface your faults, and lead you to a place of honour.
Do not covet what God has favoured some with more than He has some others.
Men have a share in what they earn, and women have theirs in what they earn.
Ask God for His favours.
Surely God has knowledge of everything.
For each We have appointed heirs to what parents and relatives leave behind.
And to those you have given your pledge in marriage give their share, for God is witness to everything.
Men are the support of women as God gives some more means than others, and because they spend of their wealth (to provide for them).
So women who are virtuous are obedient to God and guard the hidden as God has guarded it.
As for women you feel are averse, talk to them suasively; then leave them alone in bed (without molesting them) and go to bed with them (when they are willing).
If they open out to you, do not seek an excuse for blaming them.
Surely God is sublime and great.
If you fear a breach between them, appoint one arbiter from the people of the man and one from the people of the woman.
If they wish to have a settlement then God will reconcile them, for God is all-knowing and cognisant.
Pay homage to God, and make none His compeer, and be good to your parents and relatives, the orphans and the needy and the neighbours who are your relatives, and the neighbours who are strangers, and the friend by your side, the traveller and your servants and subordinates.
God does not surely love those who are arrogant and boastful,
Who are miserly and bid others to be so, and hide what God has given them in His largesse. We have prepared for unbelievers a shameful punishment.
Those who spend of their wealth to show off and do not believe in God and the Last Day, take Satan as companion, and how evil a companion (have they)!
Would something have befallen them if they had believed in God and the Last Day, and spent of what has been given them by God?
God is fully aware of all they do.
God does not wrong any one, not even the equal of an atom; and if men do good He multiplies it by two, and adds a great reward of His own.
How shall it be when We call witnesses from each and every people and call you as witness over them?
On that day those who disbelieved and disobeyed the Prophet, shall wish they were levelled with the dust, and shall not be able to conceal a thing from God.
O you who believe, do not perform your service of prayer when you are intoxicated until you are sure of what you are saying, nor when in a state of seminal pollution, until you have taken a bath, except when you are travelling.
But in case you are ill or are travelling, or you have relieved yourself of nature's call, or cohabited with a woman, and cannot find water, then take wholesome dust and pass it over your face and hands: God is benign and forgiving.
Have you not seen the people who were given a share of the Book, but who purchased only error, and wish that you also go astray?
But God knows your enemies well: and sufficient is God to protect you, and sufficient is God for all help.
Some among the Jews distort the words out of context and say (in place of the right words): "We have heard and do not obey;" and, "hear without hearing," and "listen to us," twisting their tongues and reviling the faith.
But if they had said: "We have heard and obey," and, "hear and regard us," it would have been better for them and more appropriate.
But God has disgraced them for their lack of belief; and so only a few of them believe.
O people of the Book, believe in what We have revealed, which confirms what is already with you before We disfigure your visages and turn your faces about and curse you, as We did with those who had broken the Sabbath; and what God decrees comes to pass.
God does not forgive that compeers be ascribed to Him, though He may forgive aught else if He please.
And he who ascribes compeers to God is guilty of the gravest sin.
Have you not seen the people who call themselves pure?
Yet God purifies whom He pleases, and none shall be wronged even the breadth of a thread.
See how they fabricate lies about God, which is a clear sin.
Have you not seen those who were given a portion of the Book, who believe in false deities and evil powers, and say of unbelievers: "These are better guided than those who believe."
They are the ones who were cursed by God; and those who are cursed by God will have none to protect them.
Have they a share in the kingdom?
(If they had,) they would never have given an iota to the people.
Are they so envious of others for what God has given them of His bounty?
So We had given the Book and the Law to Abraham's family, and given them great dominion.
Then some of them believed in it, and some turned away from it; yet sufficient is Hell, the flaming Fire!
And those who disbelieve Our revelations shall be cast into Hell; and when their skin is burnt up and singed, We shall give them a new coat that they may go on tasting the agony of punishment, for God is all-mighty and all-wise.
But those who believe and do good deeds We shall admit into gardens with streams of running water, where they will abide for ever, with fairest of companions and coolest of shades.
God enjoins that you render to the owners what is held in trust with you, and that when you judge among the people do so equitably.
Noble are the counsels of God, and God hears all and sees everything.
O you who believe, obey God and the Prophet and those in authority among you; and if you are at variance over something, refer it to God and the Messenger, if you believe in God and the Last Day.
This is good for you and the best of settlement.
Have you never seen those who aver they believe in what has been revealed to you and had been to others before you, yet desire to turn for judgement to evil powers, even though they have been commanded to disbelieve in them? Satan only wishes to lead them astray, far away.
When they are told: "Come to that which God has revealed, and to the Prophet," you should see the hypocrites, how they hesitate and turn their faces away.
How shall it be when they suffer misfortunes for their own misdeeds? Then they will come to you swearing by God and saying: "We wish for nothing but good and amity."
The secrets of the hearts of these people are well known to God.
So leave them alone, and counsel them and speak to them eloquent words that would touch their very souls.
We have sent no apostle but that he should be obeyed by the will of God.
If they had come to you after wronging themselves and asked forgiveness of God, and you had also asked forgiveness for them, they would surely have found God forgiving and merciful.
Indeed, by your Lord, they will not believe till they make you adjudge in their disputes and find no constraint in their minds about your decisions and accept them with full acquiescence.
If We had commanded them to lay down their lives and to go forth from their homes, only a few would have obeyed; though had they followed what they had been commanded it would surely have been good for them and the strengthening of their faith.
And We would have bestowed on them a great reward of Our own,
And led them to the path that is straight.
Those who obey God and the Prophet are with those who are blessed by God, the prophets, the sincere and the trustful, the martyrs and the upright; and how excellent a company are they!
This is a favour from God; and sufficient is God, the all-knowing.
O believers, take precautions, and advance in detachments, or go all together in a body.
Someone among you will surely lag behind, and if calamity should befall you, will say: "God was gracious to me that I was not among them."
But if success comes to you from God he will say, as though no love existed between you and him: "I wish I were with them, for I would have certainly met with great success."
Those who barter the life of this world for the next should fight in the way of God.
And We shall bestow on him who fights in the way of God, whether he is killed or is victorious, a glorious reward.
What has come upon you that you fight not in the cause of God and for the oppressed, men, women and children, who pray: "Get us out of this city, O Lord, whose people are oppressors; so send us a friend by Your will, and send us a helper."
Those who believe fight in the way of God; and those who do not, only fight for the powers of evil; so you should fight the allies of Satan.
Surely the stratagem of Satan is ineffective.
Have you not seen the people who were told: "Hold back your hands (from attacking), observe your devotional obligations and pay the zakat?"
But when they were commanded to fight, behold, a section among them were filled with fear of men as though it were the fear of God and even more, and said: "O Lord, why did you make war compulsory for us?
Why did you not allow us to live a little more?"
Say to them: "How short-lived is the commerce of this world; but that of the next is best for those who fear God; and you will not be wronged the breadth of a thread."
Death will overtake you wheresoever you be, even in the mightiest of towers.
Yet if some good comes their way they say: "It is from God;" and if it is evil that befalls them, they say: "It is indeed from you."
Say to them: "Every thing is from God."
O, what has come upon the people that even this they fail to understand!
What comes to you of good is verily from God; and what comes to you of ill is from your own self (your actions).
We have sent you as apostle to all mankind; and God is sufficient as witness.
He who obeys the Apostle obeys God; and if some turn away (remember) We have not sent you as warden over them.
They say: "We obey;" but when they leave your company, a section of them discuss at night other things than you had said; but God takes note of what they discuss.
So turn aside from them and trust in God; and God is sufficient as protector.
Do they not ponder over the Qur'an?
Had it been the word of any other but God they would surely have found a good deal of variation in it.
And when any tidings of peace or war come to them they spread the news around.
Had they gone to the Prophet or those in authority among them, then those who check and scrutinize would have known it, And but for the favour of God and His mercy you would certainly have followed Satan, except a few.
So fight on in the way of God (irrespective of the others). You cannot compel any one except your own self; but urge the believers to fight.
It may well be that God will keep back the might of the infidels, for God's might is greater, and severe His punishment.
He who intercedes in a good cause will surely have a share in the recompense; and he who abets an evil act will share the burden thereof; for God (equates and) is watchful of all things.
When you are greeted with a greeting, then greet with one fairer, or repeat the same greeting.
For God takes account of all things.
God: There is no god but He.
He will gather you together on the Day of Resurrection which is certain to come; and whose word is truer than God's?
How is it that you are divided in two factions about the hypocrites?
God has routed them for what they were doing.
Do you wish to guide him to the path whom God has allowed to go astray?
As for him whom God allows to go astray you will not find a way.
They wish you to become disbelievers as they are, so that you should become like them.
Therefore hold them not as friends until they go out of their homes in the way of God.
If they do not, seize them wherever they are and do away with them. Do not make them your friends or allies,
Except those who take refuge with a people allied to you, or those who, weary of fighting you or their people, come over to you.
If God had so willed He would surely have given them power over you, and they would have fought you.
If they keep aloof and do not fight, and offer peace, God has left you no reason to fight them.
You will also find persons who, while wishing to live in peace with you as well as with their own people, turn to civil war the moment they are called to it.
If they do not keep away from you, nor offer you peace nor restrain their hands, seize them and kill them wherever they are.
We have given you a clear sanction against them.
It is not for a believer to take a believer's life except by mistake; and he who kills a believer by mistake should free a slave who is a believer, and pay blood-money to the victim's family unless they forego it as an act of charity.
If he belonged to a community hostile to you but was himself a believer, then a slave who is a believer should be freed. In case he belonged to a people with whom you have a treaty, then give blood-money to his family and free a believing slave.
But he who has no means (to do so) should fast for a period of two months continuously to have his sins forgiven by God, and God is all-knowing and all-wise.
Any one who kills a believer intentionally will be cast into Hell to abide there for ever, and suffer God's anger and damnation. For him a greater punishment awaits.
O believers, when you go out on a journey in the way of God, be discreet and do not say to anyone who greets you in peace: "You are not a believer."
You desire the gain of earthly life, but there are prizes in plenty with God.
You were also like him (an unbeliever) in the past, but God has been gracious to you.
So be careful and discreet, for God is aware of what you do.
The faithful who sit idle, other than those who are disabled, are not equal to those who fight in the way of God with their wealth and lives.
God has exalted those in rank who fight for the faith with their wealth and souls over those who sit idle.
Though God's promise of good is for all, He has granted His favour of the highest reward to those who struggle in preference to those who sit at home.
For them are higher ranks with God, and forgiveness and grace; and God is forgiving and kind.
As for those whose souls are taken by the angels (at death) while in a state of unbelief, they will be asked by the angels: "What (state) were you in?"
They will answer: "We were oppressed in the land."
And the angels will say: "Was not God's earth large enough for you to migrate?"
Their abode will be Hell, and what an evil destination!
But those who are helpless, men, women and children, who can neither contrive a plan nor do they know the way,
May well hope for the mercy of God; and God is full of mercy and grace.
Whosoever leaves his country in duty to God will find many places of refuge, and abundance on the earth.
And he who leaves his home and becomes an emigre in the way of God and His Messenger, and death overtake him, is sure to receive his reward from God; for God is forgiving and kind.
When you travel in the land there is no sin if you curtail your service of prayer if you fear the unbelievers may harass you, for indeed your open enemies are the infidels.
When you are among them, and have to lead the service of prayer, let one group stand up with you, but let them keep their arms.
After they have paid their homage they should go to the rear, and let the group which has not done so yet offer their service of prayer with you, remaining cautious and armed, The infidels wish to find you neglectful of your arms and provisions, to attack you unawares.
It will not be a sin if you put aside your arms when you are troubled by rain, or you are ill; but take full precautions.
God has reserved for infidels a despicable punishment
If you are late in performing your service of prayer honour God by remembering Him, standing or sitting or lying on your sides.
And when you have security perform your act of prayer befittingly; and praying at fixed hours is prescribed for the faithful.
And do not be chary of pursuing them.
If you suffer, they shall also suffer like you.
But while you have hope (of success) from God, they have none.
Surely God is all-knowing and all-wise.
We have sent down to you the Book containing the truth, in whose light you should judge among the people as God has shown you, and do not be a contender for deceivers.
And seek God's forgiveness, for God is surely forgiving and kind.
Do not argue for those who harbour deceit in their hearts, for God does not love the treacherous and the iniquitous.
They try to hide from (men), but they cannot hide from God who is with them at night when they discuss such matters as He does not approve; but what they do is well within the compass of God.
Well, you are those who pleaded for them in the life of this world; but who will plead for them on the Day of Resurrection or be their security?
He who does evil or acts against his own interests (by disbelieving), then prays for God's forgiveness, will find God compassionate and merciful.
He who earns the wages of sin does so for himself; and God is aware of everything and is wise.
He who commits a mistake or iniquity and ascribes it to one who is innocent, is guilty of calumny and brazen sin.
But for the mercy of God and His grace you would certainly have been misled by a section of them; yet they could not mislead you but themselves alone, and could do you no harm, for God has revealed to you the Book and the Law, and taught you what you did not know. Great have been the blessings of God on you.
Their confidential counsels are seldom for the good, save of those who talk of charity or goodness or peace among men.
Whosoever does so for the pleasure of God, We shall give him an ample reward.
And he who opposes the Prophet even after the way has become clear to him, and follows a path other than the way of believers, We shall lead him to what he has chosen for himself, and shall take him to Hell: How evil a journey's end.
God does not forgive that compeers be ascribed to Him, and absolves all else whatsoever He will.
And he who associates compeers with God has indeed wandered far astray.
In His place they invoke only females (the pagan deities); and instead of Him they invoke Satan the obstinate rebel
Who was condemned by God and who said: "I shall take from Thy creatures my determinate share,
And mislead them and tempt them, and order them to slit the ears of animals; and order them to alter God's creation."
He who holds Satan as friend in place of God will assuredly be damned to perdition.
Whatever the promises he makes, whatever the desires he enkindles, and whatever the hopes Satan rouses in them, are no more than delusion.
For such the abode is only Hell from which they will find no escape.
But those who believe and do good deeds We shall admit into gardens with streams of running water where they will abide for ever. True is the promise of God; and whose word could be truer than God's?
It is neither dependent on your wishes, nor the wishes of the people of the Book, (but) whosoever does ill will be punished for it, and will find no protector or friend apart from God;
But he who performs good deeds, whether man or a woman, and is a believer, will surely enter Paradise, and none shall be deprived even of an iota of his reward.
Whose way is better than that of the man who has submitted to God, and does good, and who follows the creed of Abraham the upright?
And God chose Abraham as friend.
And all that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to God; and everything is well within the compass of God.
And they ask you for judgement about women.
Tell them: "God has given you instructions about them. You also read them in the Book concerning orphaned women (in your charge) to whom you deny their ordained rights and yet wish to take them in marriage, as well as in respect of helpless children, that you should be just in the matter of orphans."
The good you do is known to God.
If a woman fears aversion from her husband, or ill treatment, there is no harm if they make a peaceful settlement; and peace is an excellent thing.
But men keep self-interest uppermost.
Yet if you do good and fear God, God is cognisant of all that you do.
Howsoever you may try you will never be able to treat your wives equally.
But do not incline (to one) exclusively and leave (the other) suspended (as it were).
Yet if you do the right thing and are just, God is verily forgiving and kind.
If both (decide to) separate, God in His largesse will provide for them; for God is infinite and all wise.
All that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to God.
We had commanded those who received the Book before you, and have commanded you too, to obey the laws of God.
Even if you deny, surely all that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to God; and God is self-sufficient and praise-worthy.
For all that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to God; and God is sufficient as guardian.
He could take you away if He will, O men, and replace you with others: God has the power to do so.
Whosoever desires a reward of this world (should remember) that with God are rewards of this world and the next; and God hears all and sees everything.
O you who believe, be custodians of justice (and) witnesses for God, even though against yourselves or your parents or your relatives.
Whether a man be rich or poor, God is his greater well-wisher than you. So follow not the behests of lust lest you swerve from justice; and if you prevaricate or avoid (giving evidence), God is cognisant of all that you do.
O believers, believe in God and His Messenger and the Book He has revealed to His Apostle, and the Books revealed before.
But he who believes not in God and His angels and the Books and the prophets and the Last Day, has wandered far away.
Those who accept the faith, then disbelieve, then return to it, and deny once again and increase in disbelief, will not be forgiven by God or be guided by Him.
Give tidings to the hypocrites that painful is their doom.
Do those who take unbelievers as their friends in preference to the faithful seek power from them?
But all power belongs to God.
You have been commanded in the Book that whensoever you hear God's messages denied or derided, do not sit in that company until they begin talking of other things, or you will be no different from them.
Indeed God will put the hypocrites and infidels together in Hell.
Those who wait to see what befalls you, say in ease success comes to you from God: "Were we not with you?"
But if fortune favours the infidels, they say: "Did we not overpower you, and yet protected you against the believers?"
But God will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection; and God will never give the unbelievers a way over the faithful.
The hypocrites try to deceive God, but He (leads them to) deceive themselves.
When they stand up for performing the service of prayer they do so indolently, only for show, and remember God but little,
Wavering between the two, neither with these nor with those.
For them who are not given the guidance by God, you will never find a way.
O believers, do not hold unbelievers as friends in preference to the faithful.
Do you want to proffer a clear proof of your own guilt before God?
The hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of Hell, and you will find none to help them.
But those who repent and amend, and hold firmly to God, and are sincere and wholly obedient to God, are surely with the faithful; and God will bestow on the faithful a great reward.
Why should God punish you if you acknowledge the truth and believe?
God is responsive to gratitude and is cognisant.
God does not like ill (of others) spoken about, except by him who has been wronged. For God hears all and knows everything.
Whether you do some good openly or in secret, or forgive an ill done to you, (know) that God is forgiving and all-powerful.
Those who believe not in God and His apostles, and desire to differentiate between God and His messengers, and say: "We believe in some and not in the others," and wish to find a way (between affirmation and denial),
Are verily the real unbelievers. And We have reserved for unbelievers an ignominious punishment.
But those who believe in God and His apostles and make no distinction among any of them, will be given by Him their recompense; for God is forgiving and kind.
The people of the Book demand of you to bring for them a book from heaven.
But of Moses they had asked a bigger thing, and demanded: "Show us God face to face."
They were struck by lightning then as punishment for their wickedness.
Even then they made the calf, when clear signs had reached them.
Still We forgave them and gave Moses clear authority.
We exalted them on the Mount, and they gave a solemn pledge, and We said to them: "Enter the gates submissively," and told them: "Do not break the Sabbath," and took a solemn pledge from them.
So (they were punished) for breaking the covenant and disbelieving the signs of God, and for killing the prophets unjustly, and saying: "Our hearts are enfolded in covers," (though) in fact God had sealed them because of their unbelief; so they do not believe except a few;
And because they denied and spoke dreadful calumnies of Mary;
And for saying: "We killed the Christ, Jesus, son of Mary, who was an apostle of God;" but they neither killed nor crucified him, though it so appeared to them. Those who disagree in the matter are only lost in doubt.
But God raised him up (in position) and closer to Himself; and God is all-mighty and all-wise.
There is not one among the people of the Book who will not believe in it before his death; and he will be a witness over them on the Day of Resurrection.
Because of the wickedness of some among the Jews, and because they obstructed people from the way of God, We forbade them many things which were lawful for them;
And because they practised usury although it had been forbidden them; and for using others' wealth unjustly.
For those who are unbelievers among them We have reserved a painful punishment.
But to the learned among them, and the believers who affirm what has been revealed to you and was revealed to those before you, and to those who fulfil their devotional obligations, who pay the zakat and believe in God and the Last Day, We shall give a great reward.
We have sent revelations to you as We sent revelations to Noah and the prophets (who came) after him; and We sent revelations to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob, and their offspring, and to Jesus and Job, and to Jonah and Aaron and Solomon, and to David We gave the Book of Psalms,
And to many an apostle We have mentioned before, and to many other apostles We have not mentioned to you; and to Moses God spoke directly.
All these apostles of good news and admonition were sent so that after the apostles men may have no argument against God.
God is all-powerful and all-wise.
God is Himself witness to what has been revealed to you, and revealed with His knowledge, and the angels are witness; and God is sufficient as witness.
Those who denied and turned away from the path of God, have wandered far astray.
Those who deny and transgress will not be forgiven by God, nor be shown the way
Except to Hell, where they will abide for ever; and this is how (the law of God) works inevitably.
O men, the Apostle has now come to you, bringing the truth from your Lord; so believe for your own good; but if you deny (then remember) that all that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to God; and God is all-knowing and all-wise.
O people of the Book, do not be fanatical in your faith, and say nothing but the truth about God.
The Messiah who is Jesus, son of Mary, was only an apostle of God, and a command of His which He sent to Mary, as a mercy from Him.
So believe in God and His apostles, and do not call Him 'Trinity'.
Abstain from this for your own good; for God is only one God, and far from His glory is it to beget a son.
All that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to Him; and sufficient is God for all help.
The Christ will never disdain to be a votary of God, nor will the angels close to Him. And those who disdain to serve Him and are proud (should remember) that they will all go back to Him in the end.
Then those who believed and earned good deeds will be given their recompense in full, and even more out of grace. But those who disdain and who boast will receive a painful punishment.
They will find none except God to help them or save them.
O men, you have received infallible proof from your Lord, and We have sent down a beacon light to you.
So those who believe in God and hold fast to Him shall indeed be received into His mercy and His grace, and be guided to Him the straight path.
They ask you for judgement about 'Kalalah' (a man who dies childless).
Say: "God has given a decision in the matter of inheritance." If a man dies and leaves no child behind but have a sister, she will get a half of what he owned, as he would have done the whole of what she possessed if she had died a childless person.
In ease he has two sisters then they will get two-thirds of the heritage.
But if he has both brothers and sisters, the male will inherit a share equal to that of two females.
God makes this manifest to you lest you wander astray, for God has knowledge of everything.
O YOU WHO believe, fulfil your obligations.
Made lawful (as food) for you are animals except those mentioned (here); but unlawful during Pilgrimage is game. God ordains whatsoever He wills.
O you who believe, do not violate the (sanctity of) offerings to God, nor the rites of the holy month, nor sacrificial cattle with garlands (that are brought to the Ka'bah), nor of the people who flock to the Holy House seeking the bounties of their Lord, and His pleasure.
Hunt when you have laid aside the robe of the pilgrim. And do not let your hatred of a people who had barred you from the Holy Mosque lead you to aggression.
But help one another in goodness and piety, and do not assist in crime and rebellion, and fear God.
Surely God is severe in punishment.
Forbidden you is carrion and blood, and the flesh of the swine, and whatsoever has been killed in the name of some other than God, and whatever has been strangled, or killed by a blow or a fall, or by goring, or that which has been mauled by wild beasts unless slaughtered while still alive; and that which has been slaughtered at altars is forbidden, and also dividing the meat by casting lots with arrows.
All this is sinful.
Today the unbelievers have lost every hope of (despoiling) your creed; so do not fear them, fear Me.
Today I have perfected your system of belief and bestowed My favours upon you in full, and have chosen submission (al-Islam) as the creed for you.
If one of you is driven by hunger (to eat the forbidden) without the evil intent of sinning, then God is forgiving and kind.
They ask you what is lawful for them.
Say: "All things are lawful for you that are clean, and what the trained hunting animals take for you as you have trained then, in the light of God's teachings, but read over them the name of God, and fear (straying from the path of) God, for God is swift in the reckoning."
On this day all things that are clean have been made lawful for you; and made lawful for you is the food of the people of the Book, as your food is made lawful for them.
And lawful are the chaste Muslim women, and the women of the people of the Book who are chaste, (for marriage) and not fornication or liaison, if you give them their dowries.
Useless shall be rendered the acts of those who turn back on their faith, and they will be among the losers in the life to come.
O believers, when you stand up for the service of prayer wash your faces and hands up to elbows, and also wipe your heads, and wash your feet up to the ankles.
If you are in a state of seminal pollution, then bathe and purify yourself well.
But in case you are ill or are travelling, or you have satisfied the call of nature, or have slept with a woman, and you cannot find water, then take wholesome dust and pass it over your face and your hands, for God does not wish to impose any hardship on you.
He wishes to purify you, and grace you with His favours in full so that you may be grateful.
Remember the favours He bestowed on you, and the covenant He cemented with you, when you said: "We have heard and obey."
Have fear of God, for He knows the secrets of your heart.
O you who believe, stand up as witnesses for God in all fairness, and do not let the hatred of a people deviate you from justice.
Be just: This is closest to piety; and beware of God.
Surely God is aware of all you do.
God has made a promise of forgiveness and the highest reward to those who believe and perform good deeds.
But those who disbelieve and deny Our revelations are the people of Hell.
O believers, remember the favours God bestowed on you when a people raised their hands against you and He restrained their hands.
So fear God; and the faithful should place their trust in God.
God covenanted the people of Israel and raised twelve leaders among them, and said: "I shall verily be with you.
If you fulfil your devotional obligations, pay the zakat and believe in My apostles and support them, and give a goodly loan to God, I shall certainly absolve you of your evil, and admit you to gardens with streams of running water.
But whosoever among you denies after this, will have wandered away from the right path."
When they dishonoured their pledge We condemned them, and hardened their hearts.
So they distort the words of the Scripture out of context, and have forgotten some of what they were warned against.
You will always hear of treachery on their part except that of a few.
But forbear and forgive them, for God loves those who do good.
We had taken the pledge of those also who call themselves Christians. But they too forgot to take advantage of the warning they were given.
So We have caused enmity and hatred among them to last till the Day of Resurrection, when God will inform them of what they were doing.
O people of the Book, Our Apostle has come to you, announcing many things of the Scriptures that you have suppressed, passing over some others.
To you has come light and a clear Book from God
Through which God will lead those who follow His pleasure to the path of peace, and guide them out of darkness into light by His will, and to the path that is straight.
Verily they are unbelievers who say: "The Messiah, son of Mary, is God."
You ask them: "Who could prevail against God if He had chosen to destroy the Messiah, son of Mary, and his mother, and the rest of mankind?"
For God's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lies between them.
He creates what He please, for God has the power over all things.
Say the Jews and the Christians: "We are sons of God and beloved of Him."
Say: "Why does He punish you then for your sins?
No: You are only mortals, of His creation."
He can punish whom He please and pardon whom He will, for God's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them, and everything will go back to Him.
O you people of the Book, Our Apostle has come to you when apostles had ceased to come long ago, lest you said: "There did not come to us any messenger of good news or of warnings."
So now there has reached you a bearer of good tidings and of warnings; for God has the power over all things.
Remember when Moses said to his people: "O my people, remember the favours that God bestowed on you when He appointed apostles from among you, and made you kings and gave you what had never been given to any one in the world.
Enter then, my people, the Holy Land that God has ordained for you, and do not turn back, or you will suffer."
They said: "O Moses, in that land live a people who are formidable; we shall never go there until they leave.
We shall enter when they go away."
Then two of the men who feared (God), and to whom God was gracious, said to them: "Charge and rush the gate. If you enter, you will surely be victorious.
And place your trust in God if you truly believe."
They said: "O Moses, we shall never, never enter so long as they are there.
Go you and your Lord to fight them; we stay here."
Said (Moses): "O Lord, I have control over none but myself and my brother; so distinguish between us and these, the wicked people."
(And God) said: "Then verily this land is forbidden them for forty years, and they shall wander perplexed over the earth.
So do not grieve for these, the wicked people."
Narrate to them exactly the tale of the two sons of Adam. When each of them offered a sacrifice (to God), that of one was accepted, and that of the other was not.
Said (the one): "I will murder you," and the other replied: "God only accepts from those who are upright and preserve themselves from evil.
If you raise your hand to kill me, I will raise not mine to kill you, for I fear God, the Lord of all the worlds;
I would rather you suffered the punishment for sinning against me, and for your own sin, and became an inmate of Hell. And that is the requital for the unjust."
Then the other was induced by his passion to murder his brother, and he killed him, and became one of the damned.
Then God sent a raven which scratched the ground in order to show him how to hide the nakedness of his brother.
"Alas, the woe," said he, "that I could not be even like the raven and hide the nakedness of my brother," and was filled with remorse.
That is why We decreed for the children of Israel that whosoever kills a human being, except (as punishment) for murder or for spreading corruption in the land, it shall be like killing all humanity; and whosoever saves a life, saves the entire human race.
Our apostles brought clear proofs to them; but even after that most of them committed excesses in the land.
The punishment for those who wage war against God and His Prophet, and perpetrate disorders in the land, is to kill or hang them, or have a hand on one side and a foot on the other cut off, or banish them from the land.
Such is their disgrace in the world, and in the Hereafter their doom shall be dreadful.
But those who repent before they are subdued should know that God is forgiving and kind.
O you who believe, follow the path shown to you by God, and seek the way of proximity to Him, and struggle in His way: you may have success.
As for unbelievers, if they possess the riches of the whole earth, and two times more, and offer it as ransom for release from the torments of the Day of Resurrection, it will not be accepted from them, and their punishment will surely be painful.
They would like to escape from the Fire, but will never succeed, and their suffering will be constant
As for the thief, whether man or woman, cut his hand as punishment from God for what he had done; and God is all mighty and all wise.
But those who repent after a crime and reform, shall be forgiven by God, for God is forgiving and kind.
Do you not know that God's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth?
He punishes whom He will, and pardons whom He please, for God has the power over all things.
Be not grieved, O Apostle, by those who hasten to outrace others in denial, and say with their tongues: "We believe," but do not believe in their hearts.
And those of the Jews who listen to tell lies, and spy on behalf of others who do not come to you, and who distort the words (of the Torah) out of context, and say: "If you are given (what we say is true) accept it; but if you are not given it, beware."
You cannot intercede with God for him whom God would not show the way.
These are the people whose hearts God does not wish to purify. For them is ignominy in this world and punishment untold in the next --
Eavesdropping for telling lies, earning through unlawful means!
So, if they come to you, judge between them or decline.
And if you decline, they can do you no harm; but if you judge, you should do so with justice, for God loves those who are just.
But why should they make you a judge when the Torah is with them which contains the Law of God?
Even then they turn away. They are those who will never believe.
We sent down the Torah which contains guidance and light, in accordance with which the prophets who were obedient (to God) gave instructions to the Jews, as did the rabbis and priests, for they were the custodians and witnesses of God's writ.
So, therefore, do not fear men, fear Me, and barter not My messages away for a paltry gain.
Those who do not judge by God's revelations are infidels indeed.
And there (in the Torah) We had ordained for them a life for a life, and an eye for an eye, and a nose for a nose, and an ear for an ear, and a tooth for a tooth, and for wounds retribution, though he who forgoes it out of charity, atones for his sins. And those who do not judge by God's revelations are unjust.
Later, in the train (of the prophets), We sent Jesus, son of Mary, confirming the Torah which had been (Sent down) before him, and gave him the Gospel containing guidance and light, which corroborated the earlier Torah, a guidance and warning for those who preserve themselves from evil and follow the straight path.
Let the people of the Gospel judge by what has been revealed in it by God. And those who do not judge in accordance with what God has revealed are transgressors.
And to you We have revealed the Book containing the truth, confirming the earlier revelations, and preserving them (from change and corruption). So judge between them by what has been revealed by God, and do not follow their whims, side-stepping the truth that has reached you.
To each of you We have given a law and a way and a pattern of life.
If God had pleased He could surely have made you one people (professing one faith).
But He wished to try and test you by that which He gave you.
So try to excel in good deeds.
To Him will you all return in the end, when He will tell you of what you were at variance.
Judge between them in the light of what has been revealed by God, and do not follow their whims, and beware of them lest they lead you away from the guidance sent down to you by God.
If they turn away, then know that God is sure to punish them for some of their sins; and many of them are transgressors.
Do they seek a judgement of the days of pagan ignorance?
But who could be a better judge than God for those who are firm in their faith?
O believers, do not hold Jews and Christians as your allies. They are allies of one another; and anyone who makes them his friends is surely one of them; and God does not guide the unjust.
You will notice that those whose hearts are afflicted with sickness (of doubt) only hasten to join them and say: "We fear lest misfortune should surround us."
It may well be that God may soon send (you) success, or other command of His.
Then will they be repentant of what they had concealed in their hearts.
Then the believers will say: "Are these the people who had sworn by God on solemn oath and said: "We are surely with you?"
Wasted have been all their deeds, and losers they remain.
O believers, any one of you who turns back on his faith (should remember) that God could verily bring (in your place) another people whom He would love as they would love Him, gentle with believers, unbending with infidels, who would strive in the way of God, unafraid of blame by any slanderer.
Such is the favour of God which He bestows on whomsoever He will. God is infinite and all-knowing.
Your only friends are God and His Messenger, and those who believe and are steadfast in devotion, who pay the zakat and bow in homage (before God).
And those who take God and His Prophet and the faithful as their friends are indeed men of God, who will surely be victorious.
O believers, do not make friends with those who mock and make a sport of your faith, who were given the Book before you, and with unbelievers; and fear God if you truly believe;
(Nor make friends with) those who, when you call (the faithful) to prayer, make mock of it and jest, because they do not understand.
Say to them: "O people of the Book, what reason have you for disliking us other than that we believe in God and what has been sent down to us, and was sent down before, and because most of you are disobedient?"
Say: "Shall I inform you who will receive the worst chastisement from God?
They who were condemned by God, and on whom fell His wrath, and those who were turned to apes and swine, and those who worship the powers of evil.
They are in the worse gradation, and farthest away from the right path."
When they come to you they say: "We believe;" but unbelieving they came and unbelieving go; and God is aware of what they conceal in their hearts.
You will see among them many who rush into sin and wickedness, and devour unlawful gain.
How evil are the things they do!
Why do not their rabbis and priests prohibit them from talking of sinful things and from devouring unlawful gain?
Evil are the acts they commit!
The Jews say: "Bound are the hands of God."
Tied be their own hands, and damned may they be for saying what they say!
In fact, both His hands are open wide: He spends of His bounty in any way He please.
But what your Lord has revealed to you will only increase their rebellion and unbelief.
So We have caused enmity and hatred among them (which will last) till the Day of Resurrection.
As often as they ignite the fires of war they are extinguished by God. Yet they rush around to spread corruption in the land; but God does not love those who are corrupt.
If the people of the Book had believed and feared, We would surely have absolved them of their sins, and admitted them to gardens of delight.
And if they had followed the teachings of the Torah and the Gospel, and what has been sent down to them by their Lord, they would surely have enjoyed (blessings) from the heavens above and the earth below their feet.
Some among them are moderate, but evil is what most of them do! O Prophet, announce what has reached you from your Lord, for if you do not, you will not have delivered His message.
God will preserve you from (the mischief of) men; for God does not guide those who do not believe.
Say to them: "O people of the Book, you have no ground (for argument) until you follow the Torah and the Gospel and what has been revealed to you by your Lord."
But what has been revealed to you by your Lord will surely increase rebellion and unbelief in many; so do not grieve for those who do not believe.
All those who believe, and the Jews and the Sabians and the Christians, in fact any one who believes in God and the Last Day, and performs good deeds, will have nothing to fear or regret.
We had taken a solemn pledge from the children of Israel, and sent messengers to them; but whenever an apostle came to them bringing what did not suit their mood, they called one imposter, another they slew,
And imagined that no trials would befall them; and they turned deaf and blind (to the truth).
But God still turned to them; yet many of them turned blind and deaf again; but God sees everything they do.
They are surely infidels who say: "God is the Christ, son of Mary." But the Christ had only said: "O children of Israel, worship God who is my Lord and your Lord."
Whosoever associates a compeer with God, will have Paradise denied to him by God, and his abode shall be Hell; and the sinners will have none to help them.
Disbelievers are they surely who say: "God is the third of the trinity;" but there is no god other than God the one.
And if they do not desist from saying what they say, then indeed those among them who persist in disbelief will suffer painful punishment.
Why do they not turn to God and ask His forgiveness?
God is forgiving and kind.
The Christ, son of Mary, was but an apostle, and many apostles had (come and) gone before him; and his mother was a woman of truth.
They both ate the (same) food (as men).
Behold, how We show men clear signs, and behold, how they wander astray!
Tell them: "Leaving God aside, will you worship something that has no power over your loss or gain?"
But God is all-hearing and all-knowing.
Tell them: "O people of the Book, do not overstep the bounds of truth in your beliefs, and follow not the wishes of a people who had erred before, and led many others astray, and wandered away from the right path."
Cursed were disbelievers among the children of Israel by David and Jesus, son of Mary, because they rebelled and transgressed the bounds.
They did not restrain one another from the wicked things they used to do; and vile were the things that they were doing!
You can see among them many allying themselves with the infidels.
Vile it was what they sent ahead of them, so that God's indignation came upon them; and torment will they suffer an eternity.
If they had believed in God and the Prophet and what had been revealed to him, they would never have held them as allies; and many among them are transgressors.
You will find the Jews and idolaters most excessive in hatred of those who believe; and the closest in love to the faithful are the people who say: "We are the followers of Christ," because there are priests and monks among them, and they are not arrogant.
For when they listen to what has been revealed to this Apostle, you can see their eyes brim over with tears at the truth which they recognise, and say: "O Lord, we believe; put us down among those who bear witness (to the truth).
And why should we not believe in God and what has come down to us of the truth? And we hope to be admitted by our Lord among those who are upright and do good?"
God will reward them for saying so with gardens where streams flow by, where they will live for ever.
This is the recompense of those who do good.
But those who disbelieve and deny Our revelations are residents of Hell.
O believers, do not forbid the good things God has made lawful for you; and do not transgress.
God does not love transgressors.
Eat what is lawful and good of the provisions God has bestowed on you, and fear God in whom you believe.
God does not punish you but for what you swear in earnest. The expiation (for breaking an oath) is feeding ten persons who are poor, with food that you give your own families, or clothing them, or freeing a slave.
But he who cannot do so should fast for three days.
This is the expiation for an oath when you have sworn it.
So abide by your oaths.
Thus God makes His commandments clear to you: You may perhaps be grateful.
O believers, this wine and gambling, these idols, and these arrows you use for divination, are all acts of Satan; so keep away from them.
You may haply prosper.
Satan only wishes to create among you enmity and hatred through wine and gambling, and to divert you from the remembrance of God and prayer.
Will you therefore not desist?
Obey God and the Prophet, and beware.
If you turn away, remember, that the duty of Our Apostle is to give you a clear warning.
Those who believe and perform good deeds will not be held guilty for what they have eaten (in the past) if they fear God and believe, and do good things and are conscious (of God) and believe, and still fear and do good, for God loves those who do good.
O you who believe, God will surely try you with the game that you take with your hands or your lances, in order to know who fear Him unseen.
Whosoever transgress after this will suffer grievous punishment.
O you who believe, do not kill game when you are on pilgrimage.
And anyone among you who does so on purpose should offer livestock of equivalent value, determined by two honourable persons among you, (as atonement), to be brought to the Ka'bah as an offering; or else expiate by giving food to the poor, or its equivalent in fasting, so that he may realise the gravity of his deed.
God has forgiven what has happened in the past; but any one who does so again will be punished by God.
And God is severe in requital.
Lawful is all game of the water for you, and eating of it as food, so that you and the travellers may benefit by it. But unlawful is game of the jungle when you are on pilgrimage.
Fear God before whom you have to gather in the end.
God has made the Ka'bah, the Sacred House, a means of support for mankind, as also the holy month, the sacrificial offerings, and consecrated cattle, so that you may understand that known to God is all that is in the heavens and the earth, and God has knowledge of everything.
Know that the punishment of God is severe, but that God is also forgiving and kind.
It is for the Prophet to convey the message: God knows what you reveal and what you hide.
Tell them: "The unclean and the pure are not equal, even though the abundance of the unclean may be pleasing to you."
So fear God, O men of wisdom; you may haply find success.
O believers, do not ask about things which, if made known to you, may vex you. But if you ask about them when the Qur'an is being revealed they will be unfolded to you.
God has overlooked (your failings) in this (respect), for God is forgiving and forbearing.
Such things were asked by a people before you, but they disbelieved them afterwards.
God has not sanctioned Baheerah or Sa'ibah, Waseelah or Ham. The unbelievers fabricate lies of God, for many of them are devoid of sense.
When you say to them: "Come to what God has revealed, and the Prophet," they say: "Sufficient to us is the faith that our fathers had followed," even though their fathers had no knowledge or guidance.
O you who believe, on you rests (the responsibility) for your own selves.
If you follow the right path those who have gone astray will not be able to do you harm.
To God have all of you to return, when He will tell you what you were doing.
O you who believe, let two honest men among you be witness when you dictate your last will and testament as (the hour of) death draws near; and if death approaches while you are on a journey, two men other than yours.
Detain them after the service of prayer, and if you doubt their word make them swear by God that: "We shall not take a bribe even though it be offered by a near relative, nor hide the testimony of God, for then we shall surely be sinful."
If it transpires they have concealed the truth, two of those who are immediately concerned should take their place and swear by God: "Our testimony is truer than theirs. We have stated no more (than the truth), or else we shall be unjust"
It is thus likely that men will bear witness rightly, or else fear that their oaths may be disproved by oaths given after them.
So fear God, and do not forget that God does not guide the iniquitous.
The day God will gather the apostles and ask: "What answer was made to you?" They will say: "We know not.
And when God will say: "O Jesus, son of Mary, remember the favours I bestowed on you and your mother, and reinforced you with divine grace that you spoke to men when in the cradle, and when in the prime of life; when I taught you the law and the judgement and the Torah and the Gospel; when you formed the state of your people's destiny out of mire and you breathed (a new spirit) into it, and they rose by My leave; when you healed the blind by My leave, and the leper; when you put life into the dead by My will; and when I held back the children of Israel from you when you brought to them My signs, and the disbelievers among them said: "Surely these are nothing but pure magic."
And when I inspired the disciples (through Jesus) to believe in Me and My apostle, they said: "We believe, and You bear witness that we submit"
When the disciples said: "O Jesus, son of Mary, could your Lord send down for us a table laid with food?" he said: "Fear God, if indeed you believe."
They said: "We should like to eat of it to reassure our hearts and to know that it's the truth you have told us, and that we should be witness to it."
"O God, our Lord, send down a table well laid out with food from the skies so that this day may be a day of feast for the earlier among us and the later, and a token from You. Give us our (daily) bread, for You are the best of all givers of food."
And said God: "I shall send it down to you; but if any of you disbelieve after this, I shall inflict such punishment on him as I never shall inflict on any other creature."
And when God will ask: "O Jesus, son of Mary, did you say to mankind: 'Worship me and my mother as two deities apart from God?'
(Jesus) will answer: "Halleluja.
Could I say what I knew I had no right (to say)?
Had I said it You would surely have known, for You know what is in my heart though I know not what You have.
You alone know the secrets unknown.
I said nought to them but what You commanded me: Worship God, my Lord and your Lord.
And so long as I dwelt with them I was witness over their actions. And after my life had been done, You were their keeper; and You are a witness over all things.
If You punish them, indeed they are Your creatures; if You pardon them, indeed You are mighty and wise."
God will say: 'This is the day when the truthful shall profit by their truthfulness.
For them will be gardens with streams running by, where they will for ever abide."
God will accept them, and they will be gratified in (obeying) Him. This will surely be happiness supreme.
To God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth, and His the power over everything.
ALL PRAISE BE to God who created the heavens and the earth, and ordained darkness and light. Yet the unbelievers make the others equal of their Lord.
It is He who created you from clay then determined a term (of life) for you, and a term (is fixed) with Him.
Even then you doubt.
He is God in the heavens and the earth.
He knows what you hide and bring out into the open, and knows what you earn (of good and evil).
Yet no sign of their Lord comes to them but they turn away from it.
So they disbelieved the truth when it came to them; but they will soon come to know the reality of what they had ridiculed.
Do they not see how many generations We laid low before them, whom We had firmly established in the land as We have not established you, and showered abundant rain on them, and made rivers lap at their feet, yet whom We destroyed for their sins, and raised new generations after them?
Even if We had sent you a transcript on paper which they could feel with their hands, the unbelievers would have said: "This is nothing but clear sorcery."
They say: "How is it no angel was sent down to him?"
Had We sent an angel down the matter would have come to end, and they would have had no respite.
Even if We had sent down an angel as messenger he would have appeared in the garb of a man and filled them with confusion, like the one they are filled with.
Surely the apostles have been mocked before you; but what they had mocked rebounded on the mockers themselves.
Say: "Travel in the land and see what happened to those who disbelieved."
And ask: "To whom belongs what is in the heavens and the earth?"
Say: "To God."
He has prescribed grace for Himself.
He will gather you on the Day of Resurrection which is certain to come.
Only they who are lost of soul will not come to believe.
Whatsoever dwells in the night and day belongs to Him.
He is all-hearing and all-knowing.
Say: "Should I find some other protector besides God the Creator of the heavens and the earth, who nourishes all and is nourished by none?
Say: "I am commanded to be the first to submit to Him, and not be an idolater."
Say: "If I disobey my Lord, I fear the punishment of a grievous Day."
Whosoever is spared that Day will surely have mercy shown to him, and this will be a clear triumph.
If God sends you harm, there is no one but He who can take it away; and if He bring you good, surely He has power over everything.
It is He who prevails over His creatures, and He is all-wise and aware.
Ask: "Of all things what is most vital as evidence?"
Say: "God (who) is witness between you and me that this Qur'an has been revealed to me that I may warn you on its strength, and those whom it reaches.
Do you really bear witness there are other gods with God?"
Tell them: "I bear no such Witness."
Say: "Verily He is the only God, and I am clear of what you associate (with Him)."
Those to whom We have given the Book know it distinctly as they know their sons; but those who are lost of soul do not believe.
And who is more wicked than he who invents lies about God or denies His revelations?
Surely the wicked will not succeed.
The day We shall gather all of them together and say to those who ascribe (partners to God): "Where are the compeers who you claimed (were equal to God)?"
Then their excuse will be but to say: "By God our Lord, we were not idolaters."
You will see how they will lie against themselves, and all their slanderings will be vain.
There are some among them who listen to you; but We have put a covering on their hearts so that they fail to understand it, and a deafness appears in their ears.
Even if they saw all the signs they would not believe in them; and even when they come to you to dispute with you, the unbelievers say: "This is nothing but fables of antiquity."
And they forbid others from (believing in) it, and themselves keep away from it.
But they ruin none but themselves, and do not understand.
If you should see them when they are stood before the Fire, they will say: "Ah would that we were sent back (to the world)!
We shall not deny the signs of our Lord, and be among those who believe."
But no. What they were hiding has now become clear to them.
If they were sent back they would surely return to what had been forbidden them, for surely they are liars.
They say: "There is no other life but that of this world, and we will not be raised (from the dead)."
If you see them when they are put before their Lord, He will say to them: "Is not this the truth?"
They will answer: "Indeed, by our Lord."
He will say: "Then taste the agony of punishment for what you had denied."
They are surely lost who call the meeting with God a lie.
When the Hour comes upon them unawares, they will say: "Alas, we neglected it!" and carry their burdens on their backs: How evil the burden they will carry!
As for the life of this world, it is nothing but a frolic and frivolity.
The final abode is the best for those who are pious and fear God.
Do you not comprehend?
We know what they say distresses you. It is not you in fact they accuse of lies, but the wicked deny the revelations of God!
Many an apostle has been accused of lies before you. Yet they bore with fortitude the falsehoods and the hurt until our help arrived.
There is no changing the word of God: The news of (past) apostles has come to you already.
If their aversion still weighs upon you, seek out a tunnel (going deep) into the earth, or a ladder reaching out to the skies, and bring them a sign: (Even then they will not believe). If God had willed He would have brought them all to the right path.
So be not like the pagans.
Only they will respond who can hear.
As for the dead, raised they will be by God, then to Him they will be returned.
They say: "How is it no miracle was sent down to him from his Lord?"
Say: "God certainly has power to send down a miracle; but most men cannot understand."
There is not a thing that moves on the earth, no bird that flies on its wings, but has a community of its own like yours.
There is nothing that We have left out from recording.
Then they will all be gathered before their Lord.
Those who deny Our revelations are deaf, dumb, and lost in the dark.
God sends whosoever He wills astray, and leads whom He will to the straight path.
Say: "Have you thought if the punishment of God or the Hour (of Doom) came upon you, would you call to any other than God? Answer, if you are men of truth."
No: You will call to Him alone; and He will, if He please, remove (the distress) for which you had called Him; and forget those you associate as compeers (with Him)
We have indeed sent (apostles) to many a people before you, and inflicted upon them hardships and afflictions so that they might submit.
Then why did they not submit when Our punishment came upon them?
But their hearts were hardened, and Satan made things they were doing look attractive to them.
When they had become oblivious of what they were warned, We opened wide the gates of everything to them; yet as they rejoiced at what they were given, We caught them unawares, and they were filled with despair.
Thus were the wicked people rooted out of existence to the last. All praise be to God, the Lord of all the worlds.
Say: "Imagine if God takes away your hearing and sight, and sets a seal on your hearts, what deity other than God will restore them to you?"
See how We inflect Our signs: Even then they turn aside.
Say: "Imagine if the punishment of God were to come unawares, or openly, who will perish but the evil-doers?"
We do not send apostles but to give good tidings and to warn.
Then those who believe or reform will have neither fear nor regret.
But those who deny Our messages will be seized by nemesis for being disobedient.
Tell them: "I do not say that I possess the treasures of God, or have knowledge of the Unknown, or that I am an angel. I only follow what is sent down to me."
And say: "How can a blind man and a man who can see, be alike?
Will you not reflect?"
Warn those who fear, through this (Qur'an), that they will be gathered before their Lord, and they will have none to protect or intercede for them apart from Him. They may haply take heed for themselves.
Do not turn away those who supplicate their Lord morning and evening, seeking His magnificence.
You are not accountable for them in the least, nor they for you at all.
If you drive them away you will only be unjust.
Thus do We try men through one another so that they may ask: "Are these the ones of all of us who have been favoured by God?"
Does God not know who are the grateful?
When those who believe in Our revelations come to you, say to them: "Peace on you."
Your Lord has prescribed grace for Himself, so that in case one of you commits evil out of ignorance, then feels repentant and reforms, He may be forgiving and kind.
Thus distinctly do We explain Our signs that the way of sinners may become distinct.
Tell them: "I am forbidden to worship those you invoke apart from God."
And say: "I will not follow your wishes. If I do, I shall be lost and not be one of those who follow the right path."
Tell them: "A clear proof has come to me from my Lord, and Him you deny.
But what you wish to be hastened is not within my power.
The judgement is only God's.
He unfolds the Truth, and is the best of judges."
Say: "If what you wish to be hastened were in my power, all matters between you and me would have been settled; God is cognisant of those who are unjust."
He has the keys of the Unknown.
No one but He has knowledge; He knows what is on the land and in the sea.
Not a leaf falls without His knowledge, nor a grain in the darkest (recess) of the earth, nor any thing green or seared that is not recorded in the open book (of nature).
It is He indeed who sends you to death at night, and knows what you do in the day, then makes you rise with it again in order that the fixed term of life be fulfilled.
Then to Him you will be returned when He will tell you what you did.
He has power over His creatures, and appoints guardians to watch over them. When death comes to one of you, Our messengers take away his soul, and do not falter.
Then they are taken to God, their real lord and master.
His indeed is the judgement; and He is swift at reckoning.
Ask: "Who is it who comes to your rescue in the darkness of the desert and the sea, and whom you supplicate humbly and unseen: 'If You deliver us from this, we shall indeed he grateful?'
Say: "God delivers you from this and every calamity. Even then you ascribe compeers (to Him)!"
Say: "He has power to send you retribution from the skies above, or the earth beneath your feet, or confound you with divisions among you, and give one the taste of the vengeance of the other."
See, how distinctly We explain Our signs that they may understand.
This (Book) has been called by your people a falsehood though it is the truth.
Say: "I am not a warden over you."
A time is fixed for every prophecy; you will come to know in time.
When you see them argue about Our messages, withdraw from their company until they begin to talk of other things.
In case the Devil makes you forget, leave the company of these unjust people the moment you remember this.
As for the heedful and devout, they are not accountable for them, but should give advice: They may haply come to fear God.
Leave those alone who have made a sport and frolic of their faith, and have been seduced by the life of this world.
Remind them hereby lest a man is doomed for what he has done.
He will have none to help him, or intercede for him, other than God; and even if he offer all the ransoms they will not be accepted from him.
They are those who will be destroyed by their own acts.
There will be scalding water to drink for them and painful punishment, for they had disbelieved.
Say: 'Should we call in place of God one who can neither help nor do us harm, and turn back after having been guided by God, like a man beguiled by the devils who wanders perplexed in the wilderness while his friends call him back to the right path, saying: 'Come to us, this way?'
Say: "God's guidance is (true) guidance, and we have been commanded to submit to the Lord of all the worlds.
Observe (your) devotional obligations and fear (God), for it is He before whom you will be gathered (in the end)."
It is He who created the heavens and the earth with a definite purpose. The day He will say "Be, " it will be.
His word is the truth, His alone the power on the Day when the blast of the trumpet will be sounded.
He knows the hidden and the visible. He is all-prudent and all-knowing.
Remember when Abraham said to Azar, his father: "Why do you take idols for God?
I certainly find you and your people in error."
Thus We showed to Abraham the visible and invisible world of the heavens and the earth, that he could be among those who believe.
When the night came with her covering of darkness he saw a star, and (Azar, his father) said: "This is my Lord."
But when the star set, (Abraham) said: "I love not those that wane."
When (Azar) saw the moon rise all aglow, he said: "This is my Lord."
But even as the moon set, (Abraham) said: "If my Lord had not shown me the way I would surely have gone astray."
When (Azar) saw the sun rise all resplendent, he said: "My Lord is surely this, and the greatest of them all."
But the sun also set, and (Abraham) said: "O my people, I am through with those you associate (with God).
I have truly turned my face towards Him who created the heavens and the earth: I have chosen one way and am not an idolater."
His people argued, and he said: "Do you argue with me about God?
He has guided me already, and I fear not what you associate with Him, unless my Lord wills, for held within the knowledge of my Lord is everything.
Will you not reflect?
And why should I fear those you associate with Him when you fear not associating others with God for which He has sent down no sanction?
Tell me, whose way is the way of peace, if you have the knowledge?
They alone have peace who believe and do not intermix belief with denial, and are guided on the right path."
This is the argument We gave to Abraham against his people.
We exalt whosoever We please in rank by degrees.
Your Lord is wise and all-knowing.
And We gave him Isaac and Jacob and guided them, as We had guided Noah before them, and of his descendants, David and Solomon and Job and Joseph and Moses and Aaron.
Thus We reward those who are upright and do good.
Zachariah and John We guided, and guided Jesus and Elias who were all among the upright.
We gave guidance to Ishmael, Elisha and Jonah and Lot; And We favoured them over the other people of the world,
As We did some of their fathers and progeny and brethren, and chose them, and showed them the right path.
This is God's guidance: He gives among His creatures whom He will.
If they had associated others with Him, surely vain would have been all they did.
Those were the people to whom We gave the Book and the Law and the Prophethood.
But if they reject these things We shall entrust them to a people who will not deny.
Those were the people who were guided by God; so follow their way.
Say: "I ask no recompense of you for this.
It is but a reminder for all the people of the world."
But they failed to make a just estimation of God when they said: "He did not reveal to any man any thing."
Ask them: "Who then revealed the Book that Moses brought, -- a guidance and light for men, -- which you treat as sheafs of paper, which you display, yet conceal a great deal, though through it you were taught things you did not know before, nor even your fathers knew?"
Say: "God," and leave them to the sport of engaging in vain discourse.
And this (Qur'an) is another Book that We have revealed, blessed, affirming the earlier (revelations), so that you may warn the people of (Makkah) the town of towns, and those who live around it.
Those who believe in the life to come shall believe in it and be watchful of their moral obligations.
Who is more vile than he who slanders God of falsehood, or says: "Revelation came to me," when no such revelation came to him; or one who claims: "I can reveal the like of what has been sent down by God?"
If you could see the evil creatures in the agony of death with the angels thrusting forward their hands (saying): "Yield up your souls: This day you will suffer ignominious punishment for uttering lies about God and rejecting His signs with arrogance."
"You have come before Us all alone," (God will say), "as when you were created first, leaving behind all that We had bestowed on you. We do not see your intercessors with you who, you imagined, had partnership with you.
Shattered lie your ties with them now, and gone are the claims you made."
Indeed it is God who splits up the seed and the kernel, and brings forth the living from the dead, the dead from the living.
This is God: So whither do you stray?
He ushers in the dawn, and made the night for rest, the sun and moon a computation. Such is the measure appointed by Him, the omnipotent and all-wise.
It is He who made the stars by which you reckon your way through the darkness of the desert and the sea.
Distinct have We made Our signs for those who recognise.
It is He who produced you from a single cell, and appointed a place of sojourning, (the womb of the mother), and a place of depositing, (the grave). How clear have We made Our signs for those who understand.
It is He who sends down water from the skies, and brings out of it everything that grows, the green foliage, the grain lying close, the date palm trees with clusters of dates, and the gardens of grapes, and of olives and pomegranates, so similar yet so unlike.
Look at the fruits, how they appear on the trees, and they ripen.
In all these are signs for those who believe.
Yet they ascribe to jinns a partnership with God, although He created them; and they ascribe to Him sons and daughters, without possessing any knowledge. All praise be to Him.
He is much too exalted for things they associate (with Him).
Creator of the heavens and the earth from nothingness, how could He have a son when He has no mate? He created all things, and has knowledge of all things.
This is God, your Lord; there is no god but He, the creator of all things.
So pay homage to Him, for He takes care of everything.
No eyes can penetrate Him, but He penetrates all eyes, and He knows all the mysteries, for He is all-knowing.
To you have come signs from your Lord, (and the light of understanding). So any one who sees (and understands) does so for himself, and any one who turns blind shall suffer the consequences alone.
(Say:) "I am not a guardian over you (to make you understand)."
Thus in varied ways We explain Our signs so that they may say: "You have been instructed," and that We might make it clear to those who understand.
So follow what is sent down to you by your Lord, for homage is due to no one but God, and turn away from idolaters.
Had He willed they would not have been idolaters.
We have not appointed you their guardian, nor are you their pleader.
Do not revile those who invoke others apart from God, lest they begin to revile God out of malice and ignorance.
We have made attractive their deeds to every people.
They have to go back to their Lord, when He will tell them what they used to do.
They solemnly swear by God: "If a sign comes to us we shall certainly believe in it."
Tell them: "The signs are with God."
Yet for all you know they will not believe if the signs came to them.
We shall turn their hearts and their eyes, for they did not believe them at the very first, and leave them to wander perplexed in bewilderment.
Even if We send down the angels to them, and the dead should speak to them, and We gather all things before their eyes, they will not believe, unless God should will, for most of them are ignorant.
That is how We have made for each apostle opponents, the satans among men and jinns, who inspire one another with deceitful talk.
But if your Lord had willed they would not have done so. Pay no attention to them and to what they fabricate.
Let those who do not believe in the life to come, listen to it and be pleased with it, and let them gain what they may gain.
(Say): "Then should I seek (the source of) law elsewhere than God, when it is He who has revealed this Book to you, which distinctly explains (everything)?"
Those to whom We have given the Book know it has been sent by your Lord in truth. So be not a sceptic.
Perfected are the laws of your Lord in truth and justice, and there is no changing His laws.
He is all-hearing and all-knowing.
If you follow the majority of people on the earth, they will lead you astray from the path of God, for they follow only conjecture and surmise.
Your Lord surely knows those who have strayed from his path, and knows those who are rightly guided.
Eat only that over which the name of God has been pronounced, if you truly believe in His commands.
And why should you not eat of that over which the name of God has been pronounced, when He has made it distinctly clear what is forbidden, unless you are constrained to do so.
Surely many (men) mislead others into following their vain desires through lack of knowledge.
Your Lord certainly knows the transgressors.
Discard both the visible and invisible sin.
For those who sin will be punished for what they have done.
Do not eat of that over which God's name has not been pronounced, for that would amount to exceeding the limits of law.
Certainly the devils inspire their proteges to dispute with you: If you obey them, you will surely become an idolater.
Can he who was lifeless, to whom We gave life, and gave him a light in whose glow he walks among men, be like him who is used to darkness from which he can never emerge?
Thus have been their doings made attractive to unbelievers.
And thus have We placed in every city the greatest of the sinners to contrive and deceive; yet they contrive against no one but themselves even though they do not know.
Every time a sign comes to them they say: "We shall never believe till what God's apostles had been given comes to us."
God knows best where to direct His messages.
A degradation will befall the sinners and chastisement from God for deceiving.
Thus God guides whomsoever He please by opening wide his breast to surrender; and Straitens the breasts of those He allows to go astray, (who feel suffocated) as if they were ascending the skies.
Thus will God punish those who do not believe.
This is the straight path of your Lord. Distinct have We made Our signs for those who reflect.
For them is an abode of peace with their Lord. He will be their defender as reward for what they did.
On the day He will gather them together, (He will say:) "O you assembly of jinns, you made great use of men."
But their proteges among men will say: "O our Lord, we lived a life of mutual gain, but have now reached the term You ordained for us."
"Your abode is Hell," He will say, "where you will dwell for ever, unless God please otherwise."
Verily your Lord is wise and all-knowing.
Thus do We place some sinners over others as requital for their deeds.
O you assembly of jinns and men, did not apostles come to you from among you, communicating My signs to you, bringing warnings of this your day (of Doom)?"
They will answer: "We bear witness to our sins."
They were surely deluded by the life of the world, and bore witness against themselves because they were unbelievers.
And this (so that it may be clear) that your Lord does not destroy towns and cities arbitrarily while the citizens remain unaware.
Every one has his place according to his deeds, for your Lord is not negligent of what you do.
Your Lord is all-sufficient and full of benevolence.
He can take you away if He please, and make whom He will succeed you, as He had raised you from the progeny of others.
The promise that was made to you is bound to be fulfilled. It is not in your power to defeat it.
Tell them: "O my people, go on acting on your part, I am acting on mine.
You will soon know whose is the guerdon of life to come."
The wicked will not succeed.
They allocate a share from God's own created fields and cattle to God, and they say: "This is God's" -- or so they think -- "and that, of the compeers of God," so that what belongs to the compeers does not reach God, but that which is God's may reach the compeers (set up by them).
How bad is the judgement that they make!
In the same way have their companions shown many unbelievers the killing of their children as desirable in order to ruin them and falsify their faith.
If God had so willed they would never have done so. Leave them to their falsehoods.
They also say: "These cattle and these crops are consecrated. None may eat of them other than those we permit," -- so they assert.
"And the use of these cattle is forbidden for carrying burden." They do not pronounce the name of God on certain animals, inventing lies against Him.
And they say: "Whatever is in the wombs of these cattle is only meant for men and forbidden our women; but in case it should be still-born both could eat it."
God will punish them for what they assert.
He is all-wise and all-knowing.
They will surely perish who kill their offspring in ignorance foolhardily, and forbid the food that God has given them by fabricating lies against God.
Misguided are they surely, and will never come to guidance.
It is He who grew the gardens, trellised and bowered, and palm trees and land sown with corn and many other seeds, and olives and pomegranates, alike and yet unlike.
So eat of their fruit when they are in fruit, and give on the day of harvesting His due, and do not be extravagant, for God does not love those who are prodigal.
He has created beasts of burden and cattle for slaughter.
So eat of what God has given you for food, and do not walk in the footsteps of Satan who is surely your declared enemy.
There are eight pairs, two of the species of sheep and two of goats.
Ask them which has He forbidden, the two males or the two females, or what the females carry in their wombs?
Produce the sanction if you are truthful.
And there are two of camels and two of oxen. Ask them: "Which has He forbidden, the two males or the two females, or what the females carry in their wombs?"
Were you present at the time God issued this command?"
Who then could be more wicked than he who fabricates a lie and ascribes it to God to mislead men, without any knowledge?
God does not guide the miscreants.
You tell them: "In all the commands revealed to me I find nothing which men have been forbidden to eat except carrion and running blood and flesh of the swine for it is unclean, or meat consecrated in the name of some other than God, which is profane.
But if one is constrained to eat of these without craving or reverting to it, then surely your Lord is forgiving and kind."
We made unlawful for the Jews all animals with claws or nails, and the fat of the oxen and sheep, except that on their backs or their intestines, or which remains attached to their bones.
This was the punishment for their insubordination; and what We say is true.
If they call you a liar, tell them infinite is the mercy of your Lord; but His vengeance will not be turned back from the sinners.
But the idolaters say: "If God had so willed we would not have associated (others with Him), nor would have our fathers, nor would we have forbidden any thing."
So had others denied before them, and had to taste Our punishment in the end.
Ask them: "Have you any knowledge?
Then display it.
You follow nothing but conjecture, and are nothing but liars."
Say: "To God belongs the consummate argument.
Had He willed He would surely have guided all of you aright."
Tell them: "Bring your witnesses to testify that God has forbidden this (and this)."
Then even if they testify, you should not testify with them; and do not follow the wishes of those who deny Our signs and believe not in the Hereafter, and make others the equal of their Lord.
Tell them: "Come, I will read out what your Lord has made binding on you: That you make none the equal of God, and be good to your parents, and do not abandon your children out of poverty, for We give you food and We shall provide for them; and avoid what is shameful, whether open or hidden, and do not take a life which God has forbidden, unless for some just cause.
These things has God enjoined on you. Haply you may understand.
Do not spend the belongings of the orphans but for their betterment, until they come of age; and give in full measure, and weigh justly on the balance.
God does not burden a soul beyond capacity.
When you say a thing, let it be just, even though the matter relate to a relative of yours, and fulfil a promise made to God.
These are the things that He has enjoined that you may take heed.
(He has further commanded:) 'This is My straight path, so walk along it, and do not follow other ways, lest you should turn away from the right one.'
All this has He commanded. You may perhaps take heed for yourselves."
To that end We gave the Book to Moses, a perfect law, distinctly explaining all things, and a guidance and grace, so that they should believe in the meeting with their Lord.
Blessed is this Book We have revealed; so follow it and preserve yourself from evil that you may qualify for grace,
Lest you say: "The Book that was sent before was meant only for two groups; we were not aware of their teachings;"
Or that: "Had the Book been sent down to us we would surely have been guided better than they."
So you have now received from your Lord a clear proof and a guidance and grace.
Then who is more wicked than he who denies the signs of God and turns away from them?
We shall punish those severely who turn away: A requital indeed for having turned aside.
What are the people waiting for? For the angels to come down, or your Lord to appear, or some signs from your Lord?
The day when certain signs appear from your Lord, the embracing of faith shall not be of any avail to one who did not come to belief at first, or who did not perform good deeds by virtue of his faith.
Tell them: "Wait on, we are waiting too (for the good and evil to become distinct)."
As for those who have created schisms in their order, and formed different sects, you have no concern with them.
Their affair is with God. He will tell them the truth of what they were doing.
He who does a good deed will receive ten times its worth; and he who does evil will be requited to an equal degree; and no one will be wronged.
Tell them: "My Lord has directed me to a path that is straight, a supreme law, the creed of Abraham the upright who was not an idolater."
Tell them: "My service and sacrifice, my life and my death, are all of them for God, the creator and Lord of all the worlds.
No equal has He, I am commanded (to declare), and that I am the first to submit."
Say: "Shall I search for another lord apart from God when He is the only Lord of all and everything?"
Each soul earns (what it earns) for itself, and no man shall bear another's burden.
You have to go back to your Lord in the end when He will tell you about the things you disputed.
It is He who made you trustees on the earth, and exalted some in rank over others in order to try you by what He has given you.
Indeed your Lord's retribution is swift, yet He is forgiving and kind.
Alif Lam Mim Sad.
This Book has been sent down to you; so do not hesitate to warn (the unbelievers) through it, and remind the faithful.
Follow what has been revealed to you by your Lord, and do not follow any other lord apart from Him.
Yet little do you care to remember.
Many a habitation have We laid low before: Our retribution came upon them in the night or in the midst of siesta at noon.
And when Our punishment overtook them they had nothing to say except crying out: "We have indeed been sinners."
(On the Day of Reckoning) We shall question the people to whom We had sent Our apostles, (if they followed their teachings), and will question the apostles.
We shall recount (their deeds) to them with knowledge, for We were never absent (and saw all they did).
And the weighing will be just on that Day.
Then those whose (deeds) are heavier in the balance will find fulfilment,
And those whose (deeds) are lighter in the scale shall perish for violating Our signs.
We settled you on the earth, and provided means of livelihood for you in it; but little are the thanks you give.
Verily We created you and gave you form and shape, and ordered the angels to bow before Adam in homage; and they all bowed but Iblis who was not among those who bowed.
"What prevented you" (said God), "from bowing (before Adam) at My bidding?"
"I am better than him," said he.
"You created me from fire, and him from clay."
So God said: "Descend. You have no right to be insolent here.
Go, and away; you are one of the damned."
"Grant me respite," said he, "till the raising of the dead."
And God said: "You have the respite."
"Since You led me into error," said Iblis, "I shall lie in wait for them along Your straight path.
And I shall come upon them from the front and behind, right and left; and You will not find among them many who would give thanks."
"Begone," said (God), "contemptible and rejected!
As for those who follow you, I shall fill up Hell with all of you.
And you, O Adam, and your spouse, live in the Garden and eat your fill wheresoever you like, but do not approach this tree, or you will become iniquitous."
But Satan suggested (evil) to them, in order to reveal their hidden parts of which they were not aware (till then), and said: "Your Lord has forbidden you (to go near) this tree that you may not become angels or immortal."
Then he said to them on oath: "I am your sincere friend;"
And led them (to the tree) by deceit.
When they tasted (the fruit) of the tree their disgrace became exposed to them; and they patched the leaves of the Garden to hide it. And the Lord said to them: "Did I not forbid you this tree?
They said: "O our Lord, we have wronged ourselves. If You do not forgive us and have mercy upon us, we shall certainly be lost."
"Go," said God, "one the antagonist of the other, and live on the earth for a time ordained, and fend for yourselves.
You will live there, and there will you die," He said, "and be raised from there (On the Day of Doom)."
O sons of Adam, We have revealed to you a dress that would both hide your nakedness and be an adornment, but the raiment of piety is best.
This is one of the tokens of God: You may haply reflect.
O sons of Adam, let not Satan beguile you as he did your parents out of Eden, and made them disrobe to expose their disgrace to them.
For he and his host can see you from where you cannot see them.
We have made the devils the friends of those who do not believe,
Who say when they commit shameful acts: "Our ancestors used to do so, and God has enjoined us to do the same."
Say to them: "God never enjoins a conduct that is shameful.
You impute such lies to God as you do not know."
Tell them: "My Lord has enjoined piety, devotion in all acts of worship, and calling upon Him with exclusive obedience.
For you will be reverted back to what you were (when) created first."
A Section (among them) were guided, a section were bound to go astray, (for) instead of God they took the devils as their friends; yet they think they are on the right path.
O sons of Adam, attire yourselves at every time of worship; eat and drink, but do not be wasteful, for God does not like the prodigals.
Ask them: "Who forbids you attire that God has given to His creatures, and the good things that He has provided?"
Tell them: "They are (meant) for believers in the world, and will be theirs on the Day of Judgement."
That is how We explain Our signs to those who know.
Tell them: "My Lord has forbidden repugnant acts, whether open or disguised, sin and unjust oppression, associating others with God, of which He has sent down no authority, and saying things of God of which you have no knowledge."
A term is fixed for every people; and when their appointed time is come there will neither be a moment's delay nor haste.
O sons of Adam, when apostles come to you from among you, who convey My messages, then those who take heed and amend will have neither fear nor regret.
But those who deny Our signs and disdain them, shall belong to Hell, where they will abide for ever.
Who could be more wicked than he who imputes lies to God or denies His revelations?
Such as these will receive what is declared in the Book, and when Our angels come to draw out their souls and ask: "Where are they you worshipped other than God?"
They will answer: "They have left us and fled;" and bear witness against themselves for being infidels.
"Enter then the Fire," will God say, "with the past generations of jinns and men."
On entering each batch will condemn the other; and when all of them shall have entered one after the other, the last to come will say of those who had come before them: "O our Lord, they are the ones who led us astray; so give them double chastisement in the Fire."
He will answer: "For all it will be double; but this you do not know."
Then the former will say to the latter: "You have no privilege over us. So taste the punishment for what you had done."
Verily for those who deny Our signs and turn away in haughtiness from them, the gates of heaven shall not be opened, nor will they enter Paradise, not till the camel passes through the needle's eye.
That is how We requite the transgressors:
For them is a flooring of Hell and a covering (of fire).
That is how We requite the iniquitous.
As for those who believe and do good, We never burden a soul beyond capacity. They are men of Paradise where they will abide for ever.
Whatever the rancour they may have in their hearts We shall (cleanse and) remove.
Streams of running water shall ripple at their feet, and they will say: "We are grateful to God for guiding us here.
Never would we have been guided if God had not shown us the way.
The apostles of our Lord had indeed brought the truth."
And the cry shall resound: "This is Paradise you have inherited as meed for your deeds."
And the inmates of Paradise will call to the residents of Hell: "We have found that the promise made to us by our Lord was true.
Have you also found the promise of your Lord to be true?"
They will answer: "Yes (it is so)."
Then a crier will call from among them: "The curse of God be on the vile,
"Who obstruct those who follow the path of God and try to make it oblique, who do not believe in the life to come."
There will be a veil between them, and on the wall will be the men (of al-A'raf) who will recognise everyone by their distinguishing marks, and will call to the inmates of Paradise: "Peace on you," without having entered it themselves though hoping to do so.
When their eyes fall on the inmates of Hell they will say: "O Lord, do not place us in the crowd of the vile."
Recognising them by their marks the men of al-A'raf will call (to the inmates of Hell): "Of what use was your amassing (of wealth) of which you were proud?"
(Then pointing to the inmates of Paradise, they will say): "Are they not those of whom you had sworn and said: 'God will not have mercy on them?'
(And yet they have been told,) 'Enter Paradise where you will have no fear or regret.'"
Those in Hell will call to the inmates of Paradise: "Pour a little water over us, or give us a little of what God has given you."
They will answer: "God has verily forbidden these to those who denied the truth.
"Who made a sport and frolic of their faith and were lured by the life of the world."
As they had forgotten the meeting of this Day so shall We neglect them today for having rejected Our signs.
Indeed We had brought to them a Book distinct, replete with knowledge, and guidance and grace for men who believe.
Are they waiting for the exposition of what it speaks of?
The day that (Reality) is unravelled, the people who had lost sight of it will say: "The apostles of our Lord had indeed brought the truth.
Do we have any one to intercede for us?
If only we could go back to the world, we would act otherwise."
Indeed they have caused themselves harm, and the lies they concocted did not help.
Surely your Lord is God who created the heavens and the earth in six spans of time, then assumed all power. He covers up the day with night which comes chasing it fast; and the sun and moon and the stars are subject to His command.
It is His to create and enjoin.
Blessed be God, the Lord of all the worlds.
Pray to your Lord in humility and unseen.
He does not love the iniquitous.
And do not corrupt the land after it has been reformed; and pray to Him in awe and expectation.
The blessing of God is at hand for those who do good.
Indeed it is He who sends the winds as harbingers of auspicious news announcing His beneficence, bringing heavy clouds which We drive towards a region lying dead, and send down rain, and raise all kinds of fruits.
So shall We raise the dead that you may think and reflect.
The soil that is good produces (rich) crops by the will of its Lord, and that which is had yields only what is poor.
So do We explain Our signs in different ways to people who give thanks.
We sent Noah to his people, and he said: "O people worship God; you have no other god but He; for I fear the retribution of the great Day may fall on you."
The elders of his people replied: "We see clearly that you have gone astray."
"I have not gone astray, O my people," he said, "but have been sent by my Lord, the creator of all the worlds.
I bring to you the messages of my Lord, and give you sincere advice, for I know from God what you do not know.
Do you wonder that a warning has come to you from your Lord through a man who is one of you, and warns you to take heed for yourselves and fear God? You might be treated with mercy."
But they called him a liar, and We saved him and those with him in the Ark, and drowned the others who rejected Our signs, for they were a people purblind.
And We sent Hud, their brother, to the people of 'Ad.
He said: "O you people, worship God, for you have no other god but He.
Will you not take heed for yourselves?"
The chiefs of his people who were infidels replied: "We find you full of folly, and a liar to boot."
"I am not a fool, O people," he answered, "but have been sent by the Lord of all the worlds.
I bring to you the messages of my Lord. I am your sincere friend.
Do you wonder that a warning has come to you from your Lord through a man who is one of you and warns you?
Remember, He made you leaders after the people of Noah, and gave you a greater increase in your stature.
So think of the favours of God; you may haply be blessed."
They answered: "Have you come to say to us that we should worship only one God, abandoning those our ancestors had worshipped?
If so, bring on us what you threaten us with, if what you say is true."
He replied: "You have already been beset with punishment and the wrath of God.
Why dispute with me about names invented by you and your ancestors for which no sanction was sent down?
So wait (for what is to come), I am waiting with you."
Then We saved him and those on his side by Our grace, and destroyed to the very last those who rejected Our signs and denied the truth.
We sent to Thamud their brother Saleh.
"O you people," said he, "worship God, for you have no other god but He.
Clear proof has come to you already from your Lord, and this she-camel of God is the token for you.
Leave her free to graze upon God's earth, and do not molest her lest a grievous punishment should befall you.
Remember, how you were made leaders after the people of 'Ad, and were settled on the land so that you could construct on the plains palaces, and carve dwellings out of mountains.
So think of the favours of God, and do not act with corruption in the land."
The chiefs among the people who were arrogant towards the weaker ones among them who believed, asked: "Do you really know that Saleh has been sent by his Lord?"
They said: "Indeed we believe in the message he has brought."
Those who were arrogant answered: "We do not believe in what you believe."
Then they hamstrung the she-camel and rebelled against the command of their Lord, and said: "Bring, O Saleh, on us the affliction you promise, if you are one of the sent ones."
Then they were seized by an earthquake, and lay overturned on the ground in their homes in the morning.
Saleh turned away from them and said: "O my people, I conveyed to you the message of my Lord and warned you; but you do not like those who wish you well."
And We sent Lot, who said to his people: "Why do you commit this lecherous act which none in the world has committed before?
In preference to women you satisfy your lust with men.
Indeed you are a people who are guilty of excess."
His people made no answer, and only said: "Drive them out of the city. They profess to be pure."
But We saved him and his family, except for his wife who was one of those who stayed behind.
And We rained down on them a shower (of Stones).
So witness the end of sinners!
Remember, We sent to Midian their brother Shu'aib.
"O you people," he said, "worship God, for you have no other god but He.
Clear proof has come to you from your Lord; so give in full measure and full weight; do not keep back from people what is theirs, and do not corrupt the land after it has been reformed.
This is best for you if you believe.
Do not lie in ambush to intimidate and divert from the path of God those who believe in Him, nor seek obliquity in it.
Remember the day when you were few and He increased your numbers.
So consider the fate of those who were evil.
If some of you believe what has been sent through me, and some of you do not, have patience until God decide between us, for He is the best of all judges."
The arrogant leaders of the people replied: "We shall drive you away from our land, O Shu'aib, and those who are with you, unless you come back to your faith."
But he remarked: "Even if we are disgusted with it?
We shall only be guilty of blaspheming God if we accept your way after the people of Noah, and gave you a greater increase in your stature. So think of the favours of God; you may haply be blessed."
The chiefs among his people who did not believe said (to them): "If you follow Shu'aib and his way you will surely be ruined."
Then they were seized by an earthquake, and lay overturned on the ground in their homes in the morning.
They who called Shu'aib a liar (disappeared) as though they had never existed; and those who called Shu'aib a liar were the ones who were ruined!
So Shu'aib turned away from them and said: "O people, I conveyed to you the message of my Lord, and warned you. (But you paid no heed).
How can I grieve for a people who do not believe?"
There is not a region to which We sent a prophet and did not inflict upon its people adversity and hardship so that they may submit.
But when We changed hardship to ease, and they rose and prospered, (they forgot Our favours) and said: "Our ancestors had also known suffering and joy."
So We caught them unawares.
But if the people of these regions had believed and feared God, We would surely have showered on them blessings of the heavens and the earth; but they only denied, and We punished them for their deeds.
Are the people of the region so secure that they lie asleep unaware as Our punishment overtakes them?
Or, are the people of the towns so unafraid that (even when) Our retribution comes upon them in the hours of the morning they remain engrossed in sport and play?
Can they remain secure against the plan of God?
Only they feel secure against the plan of God who are certain of being ruined.
Do not the people who inherited the earth from the (earlier) inhabitants perceive that We could afflict them too for their sins if We pleased, and put seals on their hearts that they may not hear (the voice of truth)?
These were the (earlier) habitations whose accounts We have given to you.
Their apostles came with clear proofs, but they did not believe what they once denied.
That is how God seals the hearts of those who do not believe.
We did not find many of them faithful to their promises, and found many of them disobedient.
So We sent Moses with miracles after (these apostles) to the Pharaoh and his nobles, but they behaved with them high-handedly.
See then the end of the authors of evil.
Moses said: "O Pharaoh, I have been sent by the Lord of all the worlds;
"I am duty bound to speak nothing of God but the truth I have brought from your Lord a clear sign; so let the people of Israel depart with me."
He said: "If you have brought a sign then display it, if what you say is true."
At this Moses threw down his staff, and lo, it became a live serpent.
And he drew forth his hand, and behold, it looked white to those who beheld it.
The nobles of Pharaoh said: "He surely is a clever magician.
"He wishes to drive you away from the land.
So what do you advise?"
They said: "Put him and his brother off (awhile) and send out heralds to the cities
"To bring all the wise magicians to you."
The magicians came to the Pharaoh and said: "Is there reward for us if we succeed?"
"Yes," said he, "you will be among the honoured."
So they said: "O Moses, you may cast your spell first, or we shall cast ours."
"You cast it first," answered Moses.
When they cast their spell, they bewitched the eyes of the people and petrified them by conjuring up a great charm.
We said to Moses: "Throw down your staff;" and it swallowed up their conjurations in no time.
Thus the truth was upheld, and the falsehood that they practised was exposed.
Thus there and then they were vanquished and overthrown, humiliated.
The sorcerers fell to the ground in homage,
And said: "We have come to believe in the Lord of all the worlds,
"The Lord of Moses and Aaron."
But Pharaoh said: "You have come to accept belief in Him without my permission!
This surely is a plot you have hatched to expel the people from the land. You will soon come to know.
"I will have your hands and feet on alternate sides cut off, and have you all crucified."
They answered: "We have (in any case) to go back to our Lord.
"The only reason you have to hate us is that we believed in the signs of our Lord as they came to us.
O our Lord, give us sufficient endurance that we may die submitting (to You)."
And the leaders of Pharaoh's people said to him: "Would you allow Moses and his people to create disorder in the land and discard you and your gods?" He replied: "We shall now slay their sons and spare their women, and subdue them."
Said Moses to his people: "Invoke the help of God and be firm.
The earth belongs to God: He can make whom He wills among His creatures inherit it. The future is theirs who take heed for themselves."
They said: "We were oppressed before you came, and have been since you have come to us."
He answered: "It may well be that soon God may destroy your enemy and make you inherit the land, and then see how you behave."
We afflicted the people of Pharaoh with famine and dearth of everything that they might take heed.
Yet when good came their way they said: "It is our due;" but when misfortune befell them they put the omen down to Moses and those who were with him.
But surely the omen was with God, yet most of them did not understand.
They said: "Whatsoever the sign you have brought to deceive us, we shall not believe in you."
So We let loose on them floods and locusts, and vermin, frogs and blood -- how many different signs. But they still remained arrogant, for they were a people full of sin.
Yet when punishment overtook them, they said: "O Moses, invoke your Lord for us as you have been enjoined.
If the torment is removed, we shall certainly believe in you and let the people of Israel go with you."
But no sooner was the punishment withdrawn for a time to enable them to make good their promise than they broke it.
So We took vengeance on them, and drowned them in the sea for rejecting Our signs and not heeding them.
We then made the people who were weak (and oppressed) successors of the land to the East and the West which We had blessed.
Thus the fair promise of your Lord to the children of Israel was fulfilled, for they were patient in adversity; and whatsoever the Pharaoh and his people had fashioned, and the structures they had raised, were destroyed.
When We brought the children of Israel across the sea, and they came to a people who were devoted to their idols, they said: "O Moses, make us also a god like theirs."
"You are ignorant," he replied.
"These people and their ways will surely be destroyed, for false is what they practise.
"Do you want me to seek for you," he said, "a god other than God, when He has exalted you over all the nations of the world?
"Remember (the day) when He saved you from the people of Pharaoh who oppressed and afflicted you, and slew your sons and spared your women.
In this was a great trial from your Lord."
We made an appointment of thirty nights with Moses (On Mount Sinai) to which We added ten more; so the term set by the Lord was completed in forty nights.
Moses said to Aaron, his brother: "Deputise for me among my people. Dispose rightly, and do not follow the way of the authors of evil."
When Moses arrived at the appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he said: "O Lord, reveal Yourself to me that I may behold You."
"You cannot behold Me," He said. "But look at the mountain: If it remains firm in its place you may then behold Me."
But when his Lord appeared on the mountain in His effulgence, it crumbled to a heap of dust, and Moses fell unconscious.
When he came to, he said: "All glory to You. I turn to You in repentance, and I am the first to believe."
Said (the Lord): "O Moses, I raised you above all men by sending My messages and speaking to you; so receive what I give you, and be grateful."
And We wrote down on tablets admonitions and clear explanations of all things for Moses, and ordered him: "Hold fast to them, and command your people to observe the best in them.
I will show you the abode of the wicked.
I will turn those away from My signs who behave unjustly with arrogance in the land so that even though they see all the signs they will not believe in them; and if they see the path of rectitude, will not take it to be a way; and if they see the way of error take it to be the (right) path.
This is so for they have called Our messages lies, and have been heedless of them."
Vain are the acts of those who deny Our signs and the meeting in the Hereafter.
Can they ever be rewarded for anything but what they did?
In the absence of Moses his people prepared the image of a calf from their ornaments, which gave out the mooing of a cow.
Yet they did not see it could neither speak to them nor guide them to the right path.
Even then they took it (for a deity) and did wrong.
Then they were filled with remorse and saw that they had erred and said: "If our Lord does not forgive us we will surely be lost."
When Moses returned to his people, indignant and grieved, he said: "How wickedly you behaved in my absence.
Why must you hasten the decree of your Lord?"
And he cast aside the tablets, and pulled his brother by the hair.
"O son of my mother," said (Aaron), "these people took advantage of my weakness and almost killed me.
Do not let my enemies rejoice at my plight, and do not put me down among transgressors."
(Moses) said: "O Lord, forgive me and my brother, and admit us to Your grace, for You are the most compassionate of all."
Surely those who have taken the calf (as a god) will suffer the anger of their Lord, and disgrace in the world.
That is how We requite those who fabricate lies.
Yet those who do wrong, then repent and believe, are forgiven, for your Lord is forgiving and kind.
When his anger subsided Moses picked up the tablets. Inscribed on them was guidance and grace for those who fear their Lord.
Moses chose seventy of his people for the appointment (on Mount Sinai).
When they arrived they were seized by a tremor. (Moses) said: "O Lord, if You had so pleased You could have annihilated them and me before this.
Will You destroy us for something the foolish among us have done?
This is but a trial from You whereby You will lead whom You will astray and guide whom You please.
You are our saviour, so forgive us and have mercy on us, for You are the best of forgivers.
Enjoin for us good in the world, and good in the world to come. We turn to You alone."
And the Lord said: "I punish only those whom I will, but My mercy enfolds everything. I shall enjoin it for those who take heed for themselves, who pay the zakat and believe in My signs,
Who follow the messenger, the gentile Prophet, described in the Torah and the Gospel, who bids things noble and forbids things vile, makes lawful what is clean, and prohibits what is foul, who relieves them of their burdens, and the yoke that lies upon them. Those who believe and honour and help him, and follow the light sent with him, are those who will attain their goal."
Say: "O men, I am verily the apostle of God to you all. His whose kingdom extends over the heavens and the earth.
There is no god but He, the giver of life and death.
So believe in God and the messenger, the gentile Prophet, sent by Him, who believes in God and His messages. Obey him; you may haply be guided aright."
Among the people of Moses is a section that shows the way to the truth, and deals justly in accordance with it.
We divided them into twelve (different) tribes.
When his people asked for water, We said to Moses: "Strike the rock with your staff;" and behold, twelve springs of water gushed forth, so that each of the tribes had a place of its own to drink; and We made the clouds spread shade over them and sent for them manna and quails (and said): "Eat of the good things We have provided for you."
But (by disobeying) they did not harm Us, they harmed themselves.
And when it was said to them: "Live in this land and eat of its produce wheresoever you like, and ask for remission of your sins, but pass through the gates with submission (and not pride), We shall forgive your trespasses, and give to those who are righteous abundance,"
The wicked among them changed and perverted the word We had spoken to a word unpronounced; so We sent from heaven retribution on them for all their wickedness.
Enquire of them about the town situated by the sea where, when they did not keep the Sabbath, the fish came up to the surface of the water for them; but on days other than the Sabbath the fish did not come.
We tried them in this way, for they were disobedient.
When a Section of them said: "Why do you admonish a people whom God is about to destroy or to punish severely?" They replied: "To clear ourselves of blame before your Lord, and that they may fear God.
But when they forgot to remember the warning, We saved those who prohibited evil, but inflicted on the wicked a dreadful punishment -- requital for their disobedience.
When they persisted in doing what they had been forbidden, We said to them: "Become (like) apes despised."
And your Lord declared He would send men against them who would inflict dreadful suffering on them till the Day of Doom, for your Lord is swift in retribution, though He is certainly forgiving and kind.
We dispersed them in groups over the earth, some righteous, some otherwise; and We tried them with good things and bad, that they may haply turn back.
Then after them a new generation inherited the Book. They took to the things of this base world, and said: "We shall (surely) be forgiven this."
Yet they will accept similar things if they came their way again.
Had they not been covenanted in the Book to say nothing in the name of God but the truth?
And they have read this in it.
The abode of the life to come is better for those who fear God.
Can they not comprehend?
As for those who adhere to the Book and are firm in devotion, We shall certainly not let the wages of those who are upright to go waste.
The day We shook the mountain above them like an awning, and they feared it would fall over them, (We said): "Hold fast to what We have given you, and bear in mind what is (said) therein so that you may take heed."
When your Lord brings forth from their loins the offspring of the children of Adam, He makes them witnesses over themselves, (and asks): "Am I not your Lord?" 'Indeed,' they reply.
'We bear witness,' -- lest you should say on the Day of Resurrection: "We were not aware of this;"
Or, lest they should say: "It were our fathers who had ascribed compeers to God; we are only their offspring.
Will You destroy us for the deeds of those who dealt in vanities?"
That is how We explain Our signs distinctly so that they may come back (to the right path).
Relate to them the plight of the man whom We gave Our signs, but he passed them by, so that Satan came after him, and he went astray.
We wished to exalt him, but he loved baseness and followed his lust.
His likeness is that of a dog who hangs out his tongue if you drive him away, and still hangs it out if you leave him alone.
Such is the case of the people who deny Our signs.
Narrate this history to them; they may haply reflect.
Evil is the case of those who deny Our signs and wrong themselves.
He alone is guided whom God shows the way; and whom He leads astray is surely lost.
Many of the jinns and human beings have We destined for Hell, who possess hearts but do not feel, have eyes but do not see, have ears but do not hear, like cattle, even worse than them.
They are people unconcerned.
All the names of God are beautiful, so call Him by them; and leave those alone who act profanely towards His names: They will be retributed for their deeds.
Yet there are among those We have created people who lead (others) to the truth, and act justly in its light
We shall punish those who deny Our revelations slowly in a way that they will not know.
I will just give them respite. My plan is certainly invincible.
Have they not bethought themselves their companion is not mad?
He is only a plain admonisher.
Have they not contemplated the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and everything created by God, (to educe) that perhaps their own term is drawing to a close?
In what lore after this would they then believe?
Whosoever God allows to go astray has none to show him the way, for He leaves them to wander perplexed in their wickedness.
They ask you about the Hour: "When is its determined time?"
Say: "Only my Lord has the knowledge.
No one can reveal it except He.
Oppressive will it be for the heavens and the earth.
When it comes, it will come unawares."
They ask you about it as if you were in the know.
You tell them: "Only God has the knowledge." But most people do not know.
Tell them: "I am not master of my own gain or loss but as God may please.
If I had the knowledge of the Unknown I would have enjoyed abundance of the good, and no evil would have touched me.
I am only a bearer of warnings and bringer of happy news for those who believe."
It is He who created you from a single cell, and from it created its mate, that you may live as companions.
When the man covered the woman she conceived a light burden and carried it about.
And when she was heavy (with child) they prayed together to their Lord: "If You bestow a healthy son on us we shall truly be grateful."
But when they were given a healthy son, they started ascribing to other powers a share in what God had bestowed on them.
But God is above what they ascribe to Him.
Do they associate those with Him who cannot create a thing, and are themselves created,
Who can neither help them, nor help themselves?
If you call them to guidance they will not follow you.
It is all the same if you call them or hold your tongue.
Those whom you invoke besides God are created beings like you.
So call on them and let them answer your call, if what you say is true.
Do they have feet to walk on, or hands to hold with, or eyes to see and ears to hear with?
Say to them: "Call your compeers, and work out a plot against me, and do not give me time.
My saviour is God who has revealed this Book; and He protects those who are upright;
While those you beseech apart from Him cannot help you or even help themselves.
When you call upon them for guidance, they do not hear.
When you think they are looking at you, (in fact) they cannot see."
Cultivate tolerance, enjoin justice, and avoid the fools.
If you are instigated by the Devil to evil seek refuge in God, for God hears all and knows everything.
Verily those who fear God think of Him when assailed by the instigations of Satan, and lo! they begin to understand,
Even though their (devilish) brothers would like them to continue in error, and would not desist.
And when you do not bring a (Qur'anic) verse to them, they say: "Why don't you make one up?"
Say: "I follow only what my Lord reveals to me."
These (revelations) are an evident proof from your Lord, and a guidance and grace for those who believe.
When the Qur'an is recited listen to it in silence. You may perhaps be blessed.
Meditate on your Lord inwardly with humility and trepidation, reciting His Book softly, morning and evening, and be not negligent.
Verily those who are in the presence of your Lord are never too proud to worship and celebrate His praises, and bow in homage to Him'.
THEY ASK YOU of (benefits accruing as) spoils of war.
Tell them: "The benefits belong to God and His Messenger."
So fulfil your duty to God and keep peace among yourselves. Obey God and the Prophet, If you really believe.
Only they are true believers whose hearts fill up with awe when the name of God is mentioned; and their faith is further strengthened when His messages are read out to them; and those who place their trust in their Lord,
Who are firm in devotion, and spend of what We have given them,
Are true believers.
There are for them (high) ranks with their Lord, and pardon and noble provision.
As your Lord sent you from your home (to fight) for the true cause, a section of the faithful were averse,
Who argued with you about the matter even after it had become quite clear, as if they were being pushed into (the arms of) death as they waited.
Though God promised that one of two columns (would fall to you), you desired the one that was not armed. But God wished to confirm the truth by His words, and wipe the unbelievers out to the last,
So that Truth may be affirmed and falsehood negated, even though the sinners be averse.
Remember when you prayed to your Lord for help, He heard you and said: "I shall send a thousand angels following behind you for your aid."
He gave you the good news only to reassure your hearts, for victory comes from God alone, and certainly God is all-mighty and all-wise.
A blanketing sleep came over you as a (measure of) security from Him, and He sent down rain from the skies to cleanse you, and to remove the plague of Satan, and to strengthen your hearts and steady your steps.
And the Lord said to the angels: "I am with you; go and strengthen the faithful.
I shall fill the hearts of infidels with terror.
So smite them on their necks and every joint, (and incapacitate them),"
For they had opposed God and His Apostle; but whosoever opposes God and his Apostle (should know) that God is severe in retribution.
For you is this (punishment) to taste, for the infidels the torment of Hell.
O believers, when you meet unbelievers on the field of battle, do not turn your backs to them.
For any one who turns his back on that day, except to manoeuvre or rally to his side, will bring the wrath of God on himself, and have Hell as abode; and what an evil destination!
It was not you who killed them, but God did so.
You did not throw what you threw, (sand into the eyes of the enemy at Badr), but God, to bring out the best in the faithful by doing them a favour of His own.
God is all-hearing and all-knowing.
That was that, but remember God will make the plots of the unbelievers contemptible.
You had asked for a judgement, so the judgement has come to you (In the form of victory for the faithful).
So, if you desist it will be better for you. If you come back to it, We shall do the same, and your forces, however large, will not be of the least avail, for God is with those who believe.
O believers, obey God and His Messenger, and do not turn away from him when you hear (him speak);
And do not be like those who say: "We have heard," but do not hear.
The worst of creatures in the eyes of God are those who are deaf and dumb and devoid of sense.
If God had seen any good in them He would surely have made them hear.
Now even if He makes them hear they will turn away (in obduracy).
O believers, respond to the call of God and His Prophet when he calls you to what will give you life (and preservation). Remember that God intervenes between man and his heart, and that you will be gathered before Him.
Beware of sedition, which does not affect the oppressors alone among you, and know that the punishment of God is severe.
Remember, when you were few and powerless in the land, afraid of despoliation at the hands of men. But then God sheltered and helped you to strength, and provided for you good things that you may perhaps be grateful.
O you who believe, do not be faithless to God and His Apostle, nor violate your trusts knowingly.
Know that your worldly possessions and your children are just a temptation, and that God has greater rewards with Him.
O believers, if you follow the path shown by God, He will give you a standard (of right and wrong), and overlook your sins, and forgive you. God is abounding in benevolence.
Remember, when the infidels contrived to make you a prisoner or to murder or expel you, they plotted, but God also planned; and God's plan is the best.
When Our messages were read out to them, they said: "We have heard.
We could certainly compose (writings) like them if we choose. They are but only tales of long ago."
They had also said: "If this be the truth from you, O God, then rain down on us stones from the skies, or inflict a grievous punishment upon us."
But God would not choose to punish them while you are in their midst, nor afflict them when they are seeking forgiveness.
But what is there so special they have that God should not punish them when they obstruct people from the Holy Mosque, though they are not its (appointed) guardians?
Its guardians could be only those who are pious and devout. But most of them do not know.
Their worship in the House of God has been no more than whistling and clapping.
So they have to taste the punishment for disbelief.
Those who disbelieve spend their possessions on turning men away from God.
They will go on spending and rue it in the end, and will be subdued.
But those who remain disbelievers shall be gathered into Hell
That God may separate the bad from the good, and link the wicked together and cast them into Hell.
These are verily the people who will lose.
You tell the unbelievers in case they desist whatever has happened will be forgiven them. If they persist, they should remember the fate of those who have gone before them.
So, fight them till all opposition ends, and obedience is wholly God's.
If they desist then verily God sees all they do.
But if they are obstinate, know that God is your helper and protector: How excellent a helper, and how excellent a protector is He!
Know that one-fifth of what you acquire as booty (of war) is for God and His Apostle, and for relatives and orphans, the poor and wayfarers, if you truly believe in God and what We revealed to Our votary on the day of victory over the infidels when the two armies clashed (at Badr). For God has the power to do any thing.
(That day) when you were at one end of the valley, (the unbelievers) at the other, and the caravan below you (on the lowland by the coast), you would surely have declined to fight if (the Makkans) had offered you battle.
(But the battle did take place) that God may end the matter which had been accomplished, so that he who had to die may perish after a clear demonstration, and he who had to live may survive in the light of positive proof, for God hears all and knows everything.
God showed (the Makkans) to be few in your dream, for if He had shown them to be many you would surely have lost courage and disagreed about the (wisdom) of the battle. But God spared you this, for He surely knows what is in the hearts of men.
When you faced them He made (the enemy) seem few to you in numbers, and made you appear fewer in their eyes, (it was) so that God could accomplish what had been decreed; for all things rest with God.
O believers, when you meet an army, stand firm, and think of God a great deal that you may be blessed with success.
Obey God and His Apostle, and do not disagree among yourselves or you will be unmanned and lose courage.
Persevere, for God is with those who endure.
Do not be like those who went out of their homes full of their own importance, ostentatiously, trying to hinder others from the way of God.
But God encompasses all they do.
Satan made their deeds look alluring to them, and said: "None will prevail over you this day, for I shall be near at hand."
Yet when the two armies appeared face to face, he turned back and fled, saying: "I am not with you, for I can see what you cannot perceive.
I fear God, for His punishment is severe."
The hypocrites, and those who had doubts in their hearts, said: "Their faith has misled them."
But whoever places his trust in God will find God mighty and wise.
If you could only see the infidels as the angels draw away their souls and strike their faces and their backs, (saying): "Taste the torment of burning
For what you have brought upon yourselves." God is surely not unjust to His creatures, (they are unjust to themselves).
Their case is like that of Pharaoh's people, and of those before them, who denied the revelations of God, and were punished for their sins by God, and God is all powerful and Severe His punishment.
God does not withdraw a favour bestowed upon a people unless they change themselves, for God hears all and knows everything.
This was the case with the people of Pharaoh and those before them, who rejected the signs of their Lord and were destroyed for their sins, and We drowned the people of Pharaoh as they were oppressors.
Verily the worst of creatures in the sight of God are those who deny (the truth), and will not believe.
As for those with whom you have made a treaty and who abrogate it every time, and do not fear God,
If you meet them in battle, inflict on them such a defeat as would be a lesson for those who come after them, and that they may be warned.
If you apprehend treachery from a people (with whom you have a treaty), retaliate by breaking off (relations) with them, for God does not like those who are treacherous.
The infidels should not think that they can bypass (the law of God).
Surely they cannot get away.
Prepare against them whatever arms and cavalry you can muster, that you may strike terror in (the hearts of) the enemies of God and your own, and others besides them not known to you, but known to God. Whatever you spend in the way of God will be paid back to you in full, and no wrong will be done to you.
But if they are inclined to peace, make peace with them, and have trust in God, for He hears all and knows everything.
If they try to cheat you, God is surely sufficient for you.
It is He who has strengthened you with His help and with believers
Whose hearts He cemented with love.
You could never have united their hearts even if you had spent whatever (wealth) is in the earth; but God united them with love, for He is all-mighty and all-wise.
God is sufficient for you, O Prophet, and the faithful who follow you.
O Prophet, urge the faithful to fight.
If there are twenty among you with determination they will vanquish two hundred; and if there are a hundred then they will vanquish a thousand unbelievers, for they are people devoid of understanding.
God has lightened your burden as He knows you are weak: So, if there are a hundred men of firm determination among you, they will vanquish two hundred; and if there are a thousand of you they will vanquish two thousand by the will of God, for God is with those who are determined.
No apostle should take captives until he has battled and subdued the country.
You desire the vanities of this world, but God wills (for you the reward) of the world to come; and God is all-mighty and all-wise.
Had this not been decreed by God in advance, you would have suffered a grievous punishment for what you took (as booty).
But now use such of the spoils as are lawful and good, and fear God, for God is forgiving and kind.
O Prophet, tell the captives you have taken: "If God finds some good in your hearts, He will reward you with something better than was taken away from you, and forgive your sins, for God is forgiving and kind."
If they try to deceive you, remember they have deceived God before.
So He gave you mastery over them, for God is all-knowing and all-wise.
Those who accepted the faith and set out of their homes, and fought in the way of God wealth and soul, and those who gave them shelter and helped them, are friends of one another.
You are not responsible for protecting those who embraced the faith but did not leave their homes, until they do so.
In ease they ask for your help in the name of faith, you are duty bound to help them, except against a people with whom you have a treaty; for God sees all that you do.
Those who are infidels aid one another.
Unless you do the same there will be discord in the land and anarchy.
Those who accepted the faith and abandoned their homes, and struggled in the cause of God, and those who gave them shelter and helped them, are veritably true believers.
For them is forgiveness and noble sustenance.
Those who accepted the faith and left their homes and fought by your side, are your brothers; yet those who are related by blood are closer to one another according to the decree of God.
Verily God knows everything.
IMMUNITY is granted those idolaters by God and his Apostle with whom you have a treaty.
(They can) move about for four months freely in the land, but should know they cannot escape (the law of) God, and that God can put the unbelievers to shame.
A general proclamation is (made) this day of the Greater Pilgrimage on the part of God and His Apostle, that God is not bound (by any contract) to idolaters, nor is His Apostle.
It is, therefore, better for you to repent. If you do not, remember that you cannot elude (the grip of) God.
So announce to those who deny the truth the news of painful punishment,
Except those idolaters with whom you have a treaty, who have not failed you in the least, nor helped anyone against you.
Fulfil your obligations to them during the term (of the treaty).
God loves those who take heed for themselves.
But when these months, prohibited (for fighting), are over, slay the idolaters wheresoever you find them, and take them captive or besiege them, and lie in wait for them at every likely place.
But if they repent and fulfil their devotional obligations and pay the zakat, then let them go their way, for God is forgiving and kind.
If an idolater seeks protection, then give him asylum that he may hear the word of God.
Then escort him to a place of safety, for they are people who do not know.
How could there be a treaty between idolaters and God and His Apostle, except those you covenanted by the Sacred Mosque?
Therefore as long as they are honest with you be correct with them, for God loves those who are godly.
How (can they be trusted)? If they prevail against you they will neither observe pacts nor good faith with you.
They flatter you with their tongues, but their hearts are averse to you, for most of them are iniquitous.
They barter away the words of God for a petty price, and obstruct (others) from His path.
How evil indeed are the things they do!
They have no regard for kinship or treaties with believers, for they are transgressors.
But if they repent and are firm in devotion and pay the zakat, then they are your brothers in faith.
We explain Our commands distinctly for those who understand.
If they break their pledge after giving their word and revile your faith, fight these specimens of faithlessness, for surely their oaths have no sanctity: They may haply desist.
Will you not fight those who broke their pledge and plotted to banish the Apostle, and who were the first to attack you?
Are you afraid of them?
If you are believers you should fear God more.
Fight them so that God may punish them at your hands, and put them to shame, and help you against them, and heal the wounds of the hearts of believers,
And remove the anger from their breasts; for God turns to whosoever desires.
God is all-knowing and all-wise.
Do you think you will get away before God knows who among you fought and did not take anyone but God, His Apostle and the faithful, as their friends?
God is cognisant of all that you do.
The idolaters have no right to visit the mosques of God while bearing testimony to their disbelief.
Meaningless will be their acts, and in Hell they will bide for ever,
Only those who believe in God and the Last Day, who fulfil their devotional obligations, pay the zakat, and fear no one but God, can visit the mosques of God. They may hope to be among the guided.
Do you think that giving a drink of water to the pilgrims and going on a visit to the Sacred Mosque, is the same as believing in God and the Last Day, and striving in the cause of God?
In the eyes of God it is not the same; and God does not show the unrighteous the way.
Those who accepted the faith and left their homes and fought in the way of God, wealth and soul, have a greater reward with God, and will be successful.
Their Lord announces to them news of His mercy, acceptance, and gardens of lasting bliss
Which they will enjoy for ever.
Indeed God has greater rewards with Him.
O you who believe, do not hold your fathers and brothers as friends if they hold disbelief more dear than faith; and those of you who do so are iniquitous.
You tell them: "If your fathers and sons, your brothers and wives and families and wealth, or the business you fear may fail, and the mansions that you love, are dearer to you than God, His Apostle, and struggling in His cause, then wait until God's command arrives, for God does not show transgressors the way."
Indeed God has helped you on many occasions, even during the battle of Hunain, when you were elated with joy at your numbers which did not prove of the least avail, so that the earth and its vast expanse became too narrow for you, and you turned back and retreated.
Then God sent down a sense of tranquility on His Apostle and the faithful; and sent down troops invisible to punish the infidels.
This is the recompense of those who do not believe.
Yet God may turn (even) after this to whomsoever He please, for God is compassionate and kind.
O believers, the idolaters are unclean.
So they should not approach the Holy Mosque after this year.
In case you fear indigence (from the stoppage of business with them), then God will enrich you of His bounty if He will, for God is all-knowing and all-wise.
Fight those people of the Book who do not believe in God and the Last Day, who do not prohibit what God and His Apostle have forbidden, nor accept divine law, until all of them pay protective tax in submission.
The Jews say: "Ezra is the son of God;" the Christians say: "Christ is the son of God."
That is what they say with their tongues following assertions made by unbelievers before them.
May they be damned by God: How perverse are they!
They consider their rabbis and monks and the Christ, son of Mary, to be gods apart from God, even though they had been enjoined to worship only one God, for there is no god but He.
Too holy is He for what they ascribe to Him!
They wish to extinguish the light of God by uttering blasphemies; but God will not have it so, for He wills to perfect His light, however the unbelievers be averse.
It is He who sent His Messenger with guidance and the true faith in order to make it superior to other systems of belief, even though the idolaters may not like it.
O believers, many rabbis and priests devour the possessions of others wrongfully, and keep men away from the path of God.
To those who accumulate gold and silver, and do not spend in the way of God, announce the news of painful punishment.
On the day We shall heat up (their gold) on the fire of Hell and brand their foreheads, sides and backs (and say to them): "It is this you stored up for yourselves; so now taste of what you had stored!"
The number of months with God is twelve in accordance with God's law since the day He created the heavens and the earth.
Of these four are holy.
This is the straight reckoning.
So do not exceed yourselves during them; but fight the idolaters to the end as they fight you in like manner; and remember, God is with those Who preserve themselves from evil and do the right.
Intercalating a month is adding to unbelief.
The unbelievers are misguided by this, for they take the same month to be sacred one year and sacrilegious the next, thus making the number of months sanctified by God accord with theirs in order to make what God has forbidden, lawful.
Attractive seem to them their evil deeds; but God does not show the unbelievers the way.
What has happened to you, O believers, that when you are asked to set out in the cause of God your feet begin to drag?
Do you find the life of the world so pleasing that you forget the life to come?
Yet the profit of the life of this world is but meagre as compared to the life to come.
Unless you go out (to strive), God will inflict grievous punishment on you, and bring other people in your place, and you will not be able to harm Him in the least, for God has the power over all things.
If you do not help (the Prophet, remember) God had helped him when the infidels had forced him to leave (and he was) one of two. When both of them were in the cave, he said to his companion: "Do not grieve, for God is with us."
Then God sent divine peace on him, and invisible armies for his help, and made the unbelievers' purpose abject. Most exalted is God's word, for God is all-mighty and all-wise.
O believers, go out in the cause of God, (whether) light or heavy, and strive in the service of God, wealth and soul.
This is better for you if you understand.
(O Prophet), had the gain been close at hand, and easy the journey, they would surely have followed you; but hard was the journey and long the going.
Even then they swear by God (and say): "If we had the strength we would surely have gone out with you."
They are only ruining themselves, for God is aware they lie.
May God forgive you.
Why did you allow them (to stay behind) without ascertaining who spoke the truth and who were liars?
Those who believe in God and the Last Day, do not ask your leave to be excused from fighting wealth and soul (in the cause of God), for God knows the pious and devout.
Only they ask (for leave) who do not believe in God and the Last Day, whose hearts are full of doubt; and doubting they waver (between gain and loss).
If they had intended to go out (to fight) they would surely have made preparations. But God did not like their setting forth, and they were held back and told: "Stay at home with those who stay behind."
Had they gone out with you, they would only have been a hindrance and let loose confusion among you to create discord; for there are some in your midst who spy for them. But God knows who are the wicked.
They had tried to create disorder before and intrigued against you, but truth came out in the end and God's will prevailed, even though they did not like it.
And (many a one) there is among them who says: "Allow me (to stay back at home), and put me not on trial."
Surely they have put themselves on trial already, and Hell will enclose the unbelievers from all sides.
If good comes your way they are vexed, but if calamity befalls you, they say: "We had taken precautions in advance;" and pleased, turn away.
Tell them: "Nothing can befall us except what God decrees.
Our protector is He, and in God should the faithful place their trust."
Say: "Are you waiting for anything else but one of two good things for us, (victory or martyrdom)? Yet what we are waiting for you is the punishment of God, direct or through us.
Tell them: "You may spend (in the way of God), whether willingly or with reluctance, it will not be accepted from you, for you are reprobates."
Nothing prevents the acceptance of what they spend except that they do not believe in God and His Apostle, and come to worship but languidly and spend only grudgingly.
Do not marvel at their wealth and children.
God intends to punish them through these in the world; and their souls will depart in a state of disbelief.
They swear by God they are with you, though in fact they are not. They are only a frightened lot.
If they find a place of shelter or a cave or hole to hide, they will turn to it.
There are some among them who blame you (of partiality) in distributing the offerings made in the name of God.
In case they receive some of these they are pleased, if not, they are incensed.
They should rather have been pleased with what God and His Prophet had given them, and said: "God is sufficient for us; He will give us of His largesse as will His Apostle.
We supplicate no one but God."
Charities are meant for the indigent and needy, and those who collect and distribute them, and those whom you wish to win over, and for redeeming slaves (and captives) and those who are burdened with debt, and in the cause of God, and the wayfarers: So does God ordain.
God is all-knowing and all-wise.
There are some among them who talk ill of the Prophet by saying: "He listens to everyone." Tell them: "He listens for your good, and trusts in God and trusts the faithful, and he is a blessing for those who believe.
For those who offend the Apostle of God there is painful punishment."
They swear by God to please you; but if they are believers it would have been worthier to have pleased God and His Apostle.
Have they not realised that anyone who opposes God and His Prophet, will abide in Hell for ever?
And that is the worst disgrace.
The hypocrites fear lest a Surah is revealed concerning them, exposing what is in their hearts.
Say to them: "Mock as much as you like; God will surely expose what you dread."
But if you ask them, they will say: "We were only gossiping and jesting."
You ask them: "Were you jesting with God, His revelations and His messengers?"
Do not make excuses: You turned unbelievers after having come to faith.
If We pardon a section of you (for being frivolous), We shall punish the other for being guilty (of deliberate sin).
The hypocrites (are the same) whether men or women, the one of them being of the other.
They encourage what is bad and dissuade from the good, and tighten their purses (when it comes to spending in the way of God).
Of God they are oblivious; so He is oblivious of them.
The hypocrites are indeed transgressors.
God has reserved for hypocrites, whether men or women, and for unbelievers, the fire of Hell, where they will abide for ever.
This is sufficient for them: They have God's condemnation and lasting torment,
Like those before you who were greater in strength, had more wealth and children than you, who enjoyed their lot in this world, as you have enjoyed your share like them.
You indulge in idle talk, as they had indulged in vain discourse.
Yet nothing of what they did remains in this world or will in the next, and they are the losers.
Has not the account of those before them come to them, -- of the people of Noah and 'Ad and Thamud, of Abraham and Midian, and all the habitations that were destroyed?
Their apostles had come to them with clear proofs; and God did not surely wrong them, they wronged themselves.
Those who believe, men and women, befriend one another, and enjoin what is right and prohibit what is wrong. They observe their devotional obligations, pay the zakat, and obey God and His Apostle.
God will be merciful to them, for God is all-mighty and all-wise.
God has promised men and women who believe gardens with streams of running water where they will abide for ever, and beautiful mansions in the Garden of Eden, and the blessings of God above all.
That will be happiness supreme.
Strive, O Prophet, against the unbelievers and the hypocrites, and deal with them firmly.
Their final abode is Hell: And what a wretched destination!
They swear by God: "We never said this." But they surely said words disbelieving the truth, and they turned unbelievers after having come to faith, and designed what they could not accomplish.
They did it only out of vengeance for God and His Apostle had enriched them by their grace.
So, if they repent it is better for them. If they turn away then God would afflict them with painful punishment in this world and the next; and none will they have on the face of the earth to protect or help them.
Some of them made a covenant with God: "If You give us in Your bounty we shall give alms and be upright."
But when He gave them of His bounty they became greedy, and then turned away.
As a consequence of breaking their promise made to God, and telling lies, he filled their hearts with hypocrisy which will last till the day they come before Him.
Have they not realised that God knows their secrets and their confidential talk, and that God has the knowledge of unknown things?
They who defame those of the believers who give alms willingly, and deride those who have nothing besides what they earn by their labour (to give in charity), will be derided by God, and will suffer painful punishment.
Whether you plead forgiveness for them or not, God will not forgive them, even though you plead seventy times, for they disbelieved in God and His Apostle; and God does not show transgressors the way.
Those who were left behind rejoiced that they stayed at home against the wishes of God's Apostle, being averse to fighting in the way of God with their wealth and lives, and said: "Do not go in this heat."
Tell them: "The heat of Hell is far more intense."
If only they had cared to instruct themselves!
So let them laugh a little, for weep they will, more as retribution for what they have done.
If you come back to them by (the grace of) God, and they seek your permission to go (to fight), you should tell them: "You will never go out nor fight the enemy with me any more.
You preferred to stay back on the first occasion, so stay at home with those who stay behind."
Do not invoke blessings on any of them who die, nor stand to pray at their graves, for they disbelieved in God and His Prophet, and died transgressors.
And let not their wealth and children astonish you.
God wishes to punish them through these in the world, and their souls will depart in a state of disbelief.
Whenever a Surah is revealed (which says): "Believe in God and fight along with His Prophet," the well-to-do among them ask for leave to stay at home, and say: "Leave us with those who are left behind."
They prefer to be with women who (are allowed to) stay at home during war, and their hearts are sealed; so they fail to understand.
But the Prophet and those who have embraced the faith with him, and have fought wealth and soul (in the way of God), are blessed and will be successful.
God has provision for them of gardens with Streams of running water, where they will abide for ever.
This will be the supreme triumph.
Some Arabs of the desert came with ready excuses, asking for leave to stay behind. But those who had lied to God and His Prophet stayed at home doing nothing.
So the punishment for those who disbelieve among them will be painful.
No blame will attach to the old and the sick, or those without means to spend on good acts, if they stay behind provided they are sincere to God and His Apostle; There is no way to blame those who are doers of good, for God is forgiving and kind.
Nor will they be blamed who came to you for transport, to whom you said: "I cannot find any means of conveyance for you," and they went away in tears, grieving that they lacked the means to spend (on carriage).
Blame will lie on those who are rich yet ask your leave to stay behind.
They prefer to stay with women who stay at home, and God seals their hearts; so they do not understand.
When you come back they will offer excuses to you.
Tell them: "Make no excuses; we do not believe you.
God has informed us about you; and God and His Apostle shall watch your conduct.
Then you will be brought to Him who knows what is hidden and what is manifest. He will tell you of what you did."
They will beg you in the name of God, on your return, to forgive them; but you keep away from them: They are scum; their abode is Hell: Requital for what they had done.
They will plead on oath that you accept them.
Even if you accept them, remember God does not accept people who are disobedient.
The village Arabs are more obstinate in disbelief and hypocrisy, and impervious to ordinances revealed to His Apostle by God; yet God is aware of everything and is wise.
Some of these rustics take whatever they spend in the way of God as a penalty, and wait for an adverse turn in your fortune.
For them will be the adverse change, as God hears all and knows everything.
Yet some Arabs of the desert believe in God and the Last Day, and consider what they spend to be a means of bringing them nearer to God and the blessings of the Prophet.
This is certainly a means of achieving nearness (to God), and God will admit them to His mercy, for God is forgiving and kind.
Those among the migrants (from Makkah) and helpers (in Madina) who were the first to believe, and those who followed them in goodness, have been accepted by God and they follow His way.
For them He has gardens with streams of running water where they will abide for ever; and that is happiness supreme.
Some of the Arabs of the desert around you are hypocrites, and some of the people of Madina are stubborn in hypocrisy. You are not aware of them; We know them, and will punish them twice, and they will be sent to a harrowing doom.
But there are others who admit their sins of mixing good deeds with evil.
It may be that God will accept their repentance, for God is forgiving and kind.
Accept the offerings they make from their wealth in order to cleanse and purify them for progress, and invoke blessings upon them.
Your blessings will surely bring them peace, for God hears all and knows everything.
Do they not know that God accepts the repentance of His creatures and receives what they offer in charity, and that He is forgiving and kind?
Say to them: "Act.
God will see your conduct, and so will His Apostle and the faithful; for you will in the end go back to Him, who knows the unknown and the known, who will tell you of what you were doing."
There are still some others whose affairs await the dispensation of God.
He may punish or pardon them, for God is all-knowing and all-wise.
There are those who built a mosque on opposition and disbelief, and to cause rifts among the faithful, and to serve as an outpost for those who have warred against God and His Apostle before this.
Yet they will surely swear: "We had only meant well." But God is witness that they are liars.
Never set foot in that place. Only a mosque whose foundations have been laid from the very first on godliness is worthy of your visiting it.
There you will find men who wish to be purified; and God loves those who are pure.
Is the man who lays the foundations of his sanctum on his allegiance to God and the wish to seek His favour, better, or he who lays the foundations of his building on the edge of a bank eroded by water, which will collapse with him into the fire of Hell?
But God does not guide the people who are wilfully unjust.
The edifice they have built will always fill their minds with perturbation (which will not cease) till their hearts are rent to pieces, for God is all-knowing and all-wise.
God has verily bought the souls and possessions of the faithful in exchange for a promise of Paradise. They fight in the cause of God, and kill and are killed.
This is a promise incumbent on Him, as in the Torah, so the Gospel and the Qur'an.
And who is more true to his promise than God? So rejoice at the bargain you have made with Him; for this will be triumph supreme.
To those who repent and pay homage, give praise and are devout, who kneel in prayer and bow in supplication, who enjoin good deeds and prohibit the bad, and keep to the limits set by God, announce the news of rejoicing to the faithful.
It is not worthy of the Prophet and those who believe to seek forgiveness for those who are idolaters, even though they may be their relatives, after they have come to know that they are destined for Hell.
As for Abraham's prayer for his father, he was fulfilling a promise he had made to him. Yet when it became evident to him that (his father) was an enemy of God, he broke away from him, though Abraham was soft hearted and kind.
God never leads men astray after guiding them, until He makes quite clear to them what they should avoid, for God indeed knows each and everything.
Verily God's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth.
He alone is the giver of life and death; and none do you have besides God as friend and helper.
God was kind to the Prophet, the emigrants, and the helpers of the faithful who followed him in the hour of distress.
When a section of them were about to lose courage He turned to them in His mercy, for He is compassionate and kind.
He has relented towards the three also (who had refused to go to the battle of the Ditch) whose case was left undecided, and even the earth with all its expanse had become narrow for them, and their lives were confined, and they came to realise there was no refuge for them except in God.
So He softened towards them that they may repent; for God surely accepts repentance and is merciful.
O believers, do not stray from the path of God, and be with those who are truthful.
It was not worthy of the people of Madina, and the Arabs of the desert around them, to abandon the Prophet of God, and to care more for themselves than for him; for there is no hardship or thirst or hunger that they know in the service of God, and no place they walk on where walking provokes the unbelievers, and no harm they receive from the enemy, but is put down as a good deed in their favour.
Surely God does not let the recompense of those who do good to go waste.
There is not a sum, large or small, that they spend, not a piece of land that they traverse (in the service of God) which is not put down in their favour, so that God could reward them for what they had done.
It is not possible for all believers to go out (to fight).
So a part of each section (of the population) should go (to fight) in order that the others may acquire understanding of law and divinity, and warn their companions on return so that they may take heed for themselves.
O believers, fight the unbelievers around you, and let them realise that you are firm: Remember, God is with those who are pious and obedient to Him.
When a Surah is revealed some of them remark: "Whose faith among you has it increased?"
It does increase the faith of those who believe, and they rejoice.
But it adds disbelief to disbelief for those whose hearts are filled with doubt, and they die disbelieving.
Do they not know that they are tried every year once or twice?
Even then they do not repent and take heed.
Whenever a Surah is revealed they look at each other (so as to ask): "Is anyone looking at Us?" and then turn away.
Indeed God has turned their hearts away (from the truth), for they cannot discern the law of heaven.
To you has come an Apostle from among you. Any sorrow that befalls you weighs upon him; He is eager for your happiness, full of concern for the faithful, compassionate and kind.
So, if they turn away, say to them: "God is sufficient for me.
There is no God but He; I depend on Him alone, the Lord of the glorious Throne."
ALIF LAM RA. These are the verses of the authoritative Book.
Are the people astonished that a man who is one of them was commanded by Us to warn them and to bring glad tidings to those who believe that they have a true precedence with their Lord?
(Yet) the unbelievers say: "He is a clear sorcerer."
Your Lord is God who created the heavens and the earth in six spans, then assumed His power, dispensing all affairs.
None can intercede with Him except by His leave.
He is God, your Lord, so worship Him.
Will you not be warned?
To Him will you all return: God's promise is true.
It is He who originates creation, then will revert it, so that He may reward those who believe and do good things in all justice. But those who deny the truth will receive boiling water to drink and grievous punishment, for they disbelieved.
It is He who gave the sun its radiance, the moon its lustre, and appointed its stations so that you may compute years and numbers.
God did not create them but with deliberation.
He distinctly explains His signs for those who can understand.
In the alternation of night and day, and all that He has created in the heavens and the earth, are certainly signs for people who fear God.
As for those who do not hope to meet Us (after death), and are content with the life of this world, who are oblivious of Our signs,
Will have Hell as their abode for what they have earned.
But those who believe and act for a beneficial end will be guided by their Lord for their good faith.
At their feet shall flow streams of running water in gardens of delight.
Their invocation will be: "All glory to you, O God," and "Peace" will be their salutation, and the end of their prayer (will be): "All praise be to God, the Lord of all the worlds."
If God were to hasten the evil, as men try to hasten the good, their term would come to end.
So We leave those who do not expect to meet Us to wander perplexed in transgression.
When man is afflicted with adversity he calls to Us, whether lying on his side, or sitting or standing. But when We take away his troubles, he moves away, as though he had never called to Us in affliction.
In the same way, attractive have been made their deeds to the prodigals.
How many generations did We lay low before you when they became wilfully unjust. Their apostles had brought clear proofs to them, yet they never believed.
So We punished the sinful people.
Then We appointed you leaders in the land after them to see how you behaved.
When Our clear messages are recited to them, those who do not hope to meet Us, say: "Bring a different Qur'an, or make amendments to this one."
Say: "It is not for me to change it of my will.
I follow (only) what is revealed to me.
If I disobey my Lord, I fear the punishment of an awful Day."
Say: "Had God pleased I would never have recited it to you, nor would He have given you comprehension of it.
(Remember that I am one of you) and have lived a whole life with you before (its revelation). Even then you do not understand."
Who is more unjust than he who imputes lies to God or denies His revelations?
The sinners will surely not be reprieved.
They worship those besides God who cannot do them harm or bring them gain, and say: "These are our intercessors with God."
Say: "Do you want to inform God of things in the heavens and the earth He does not know?"
Glorious is He, and too exalted for what they associate with Him!
Men were once a community of one faith; but they differed (and followed different ways). Had it not been for the word proclaimed by your Lord before, their differences would have been resolved.
They say: "How is it that no sign was sent by his Lord (to His Prophet)?"
Tell them: "Unknown things are only known to God.
So watch and wait (for the sign); I am waiting and expecting with you."
When We let them taste Our mercy after affliction, they contrive against Our signs.
Say: "God is swifter at contriving," for Our angels record everything you plan.
It is He who enables you to travel over land and sea.
When you sail in ships in a favourable breeze, you rejoice. But when a gale begins to blow and the waves dash against them from every side they realise that they have been caught in it, (and) they call on God in all faith: "If You save us from this we shall ever be grateful."
But when He rescues them, they commit excesses in the land unjustly again.
Your rebellion, O people, shall recoil back on your own selves.
The joys of the world (are only ephemeral): You have to come back to Us in the end. We shall then inform you what you were doing.
The life of the world is like the rain that waters the crops of the earth which are used as food by men and cattle. But when the earth is embellished and adorned with gold, and its tillers begin to feel that (the crops) are under control, Our command descends suddenly at night or in the day, and We mow them down as though there was nothing there yesterday.
This is how We distinctly explain Our signs to those who think.
God invites you to mansions of peace, and guides whosoever He will to the path that is straight
For those who do good there is goodness and more, and no blot or disgrace will cover their faces.
They are people of Paradise, where they will abide for ever.
But those who earn evil shall be punished to an equal degree as their evil, and they will be covered with shame, and will have none to protect them against God: Their faces shall be blackened as though with patches of the night.
They are the people of Hell, where they will abide for ever,
The day We shall gather them all together We shall say to the idolaters: "Take your stand with the compeers you worshipped as the equals of God."
We shall then create a rift between them, and the compeers will say: "You did not worship us;
For God is sufficient as witness between us and you we were not aware of your worship."
Then each will see what he had done in the past; and they will turn to God, their true Lord, and all the lies they had fabricated will be of no avail to them.
Ask them: "Who gives you food and sustenance from the skies and the earth?
Or, who is the lord of ear and eye?
And who brings forth the living from the dead, the dead from the living?
And who directs all affairs?"
They will say: "God."
So tell them: "Why do you not fear Him?"
Such then is God, your true Lord; and when truth is gone what is left but error?
So why do you turn away?
Thus the word of your Lord about those who disobey comes true, that they do not believe.
Ask them: "Is there among the partners (you ascribe to God) one who first originates then reverts it?
Say: "It is God alone who first creates and then reverts it.
So where do you stray?"
Ask: "Is there one among those you associate with God who can show the way to the truth?"
Say: "It is God who shows the way to truth."
Then who is more worthy of being followed -- He who guides to the truth, or he who cannot find the path until shown the way?
What has happened to you that you judge in such a wise?
Many of them follow nothing but illusion; yet illusion cannot replace the reality.
God verily knows what they do.
This Qur'an is not such (a writ) as could be composed by anyone but God.
It confirms what has been revealed before, and is an exposition of (Heaven's) law. Without any doubt it's from the Lord of all the worlds.
Do they say (of the Prophet) that: "He has composed it?"
Say to them: "Bring a Surah like this, and call anyone apart from God you can (to help you), if what you say is true."
In fact, they deny what is beyond the reach of their knowledge, whose explanation has not reached them yet.
So had those who have gone before them denied; but look at the fate of the unjust
Some of them will believe in it, some will not. Your Lord knows the transgressors well.
If they (still) call you a liar, tell them: "For me my actions, for you yours.
You are not answerable for my deeds, nor I for what you do."
Some of them listen to you: But can you make the deaf hear who do not understand a thing?
Some of them look toward you: But can you show the blind the way even when they cannot see?
Surely God does not wrong anyone; they wrong themselves.
The day He will gather them together it will appear to them that they had lived (in the world) but an hour of a day to make each other's acquaintance.
Verily those who deny the meeting with God will be lost, and not find the way.
Whether We show you some of the promise (of punishment in wait) for them, or take you to Ourself, their returning is to Us in the end; and God is a witness to all they do.
For every people there is an apostle; and when their apostle is come the matter is decided between them equitably, and no one is wronged.
They say: "When is this promise going to come, if what you say is true?"
Say: "I have no power over my own gain or loss other than what God may please."
Every people have a certain term. When their time is come they can neither delay it an hour nor advance it a moment forward.
Say: "Have you ever thought if His punishment befalls you at night or in the day, what would the sinners do to despatch it?
Will you believe it when it comes to pass?
Indeed, you will believe it then.
How impatient you were to hasten it!
Then will the sinners be told: "Now taste everlasting torment.
Should you be rewarded for anything else but what you did?"
Yet they want to be informed if it is true.
Say: "By my Lord, it is the truth.
You cannot invalidate it."
Even if every soul that has sinned possessed whatever is on the earth, it would surely offer it to ransom itself, and feel repentant on seeing the punishment.
Yet the sentence would be passed with justice, and not one will be wronged.
For all that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to God.
Remember, the promise of God is true.
But most of them do not know.
He is the giver of life and death, and to Him you will return.
O men, a warning has come to you from your Lord, a remedy for the (doubts) of the heart, and a guidance and grace for those who believe.
Say: "It is the blessing and mercy of God; so rejoice in it.
It is better than all that you amass."
Say: "Have you thought of what God has sent you for food, of which you have labelled some as lawful and some forbidden?"
And ask: "Has God commanded this, or you are imputing lies to God?"
What do those who invent lies of God think about the Day of Reckoning?
(Will they escape the judgement?) In fact God is gracious to men; but most of them are not grateful.
There is no state you are in, whether reading from the Qur'an, or doing something else, but We are watching you as you are engaged in it.
There is not the weight of an atom on the earth and in the heavens that is hidden from your Lord, nor is there anything smaller or greater than this but is recorded in the perspicuous Book.
Remember, there is neither fear nor regret for the friends of God.
Those who believe and obey God,
For them is good news in the life of the world and in the life to come. There is no changing the words of God.
You should not be grieved by what they say.
All glory is wholly for God: He is the one who hears and knows everything.
Remember, whosoever is in the heavens and the earth belongs to God.
Those who call on others they associate with God, follow nothing but conjecture, and only guess.
It is He who made the night for you to rest, and made the day enlightening.
Indeed there are signs in this for those who listen.
They say: "God has begotten a son."
Immaculate is He and self-sufficient."
Whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth belongs to Him.
You have no proof for this (assertion): Why do you say things of God you do not know?
Say: "Those who fabricate lies about God will never succeed."
Let them profit by the world (while they may): In the end they will come back to Us.
Then We shall make them taste severe punishment for having denied (the truth).
Recount to them the story of Noah when he said to his people: "O people, if you find my staying with you and warning through God's signs, unbearable to you, know that I have reposed my trust in God. So plan your move, and call your associates, and make certain of your plan; then do whatever you intend against me, allowing me no respite.
If you turn away from me (remember) I do not ask any recompense from you.
My reward is with God; I have been commanded to be one of those who submit to Him."
Even then they denied him; so We saved him and those with him, in the ark, and established them in the land, and drowned those who denied Our signs.
So think of the fate of those who were warned (and took no heed).
Afterwards We sent many messengers who brought clear proofs to their peoples.
But they were not prepared to believe what they had once denied.
That is how We seal the hearts of the iniquitous.
Then after them We sent Moses and Aaron with Our signs to the Pharaoh and his nobles; but they behaved arrogantly, for they were a people full of guilt.
Thus, when the truth had come to them from Us, they said: "Surely this is nothing but pure magic."
"You say this of the truth," said Moses, "after it has come to you.
Is this magic?
But sorcerers do not ever prosper."
"Have you come," said they, "to turn us back from what we found our ancestors doing, so that the two of you may attain supremacy in the land?
We shall not believe in what you say.
"Bring the cleverest magicians to me," said the Pharaoh.
So when the magicians arrived, Moses said to them: "Cast whatever (spell) you have to cast."
When they had cast (their spell) Moses said: "What you have cast is only a charm which God will surely nullify.
God does not verily render the deeds of evil-doers righteous.
God vindicates the truth by His commands, however the sinners may dislike it."
But none of them put faith in Moses except some youths among his people who were nonetheless afraid lest the Pharaoh and his nobles should persecute them; for the Pharaoh was mighty in the land, and guilty of excesses.
Moses said: "O my people, if you do believe in God place your trust in Him if you are obedient."
They answered: "We have placed our trust in God.
O Lord, do not make us a target of oppression for these tyrannical people,
And deliver us by Your grace from a people who do not believe."
We commanded Moses and his brother: "Build homes for your people in Egypt, and make your houses places of worship, perform your acts of prayer and give happy tidings to those who believe."
And Moses said: "O Lord, have You bestowed on the Pharaoh and his nobles pomp and plenty in the life of this world that they might mislead people from Your path?
Destroy their possessions, O Lord, and harden their hearts that they may not believe until they face the painful punishment."
Said (the Lord): "Your prayer is answered.
Therefore persist and do not follow the path of those who are ignorant."
And We brought the people of Israel across the sea, but the Pharaoh and his army pursued them wickedly and maliciously till he was on the point of drowning, and he said: "I believe that there is no god but He in whom the people of Israel believe, and I submit to Him."
"Yes, now" (was the answer), "though before this you were disobedient and rebellious.
We shall preserve your body today that you may be a lesson for those who come after you; as many a man is heedless of Our signs."
We gave the people of Israel a settled abode, and bestowed good things on them to eat and use. So they did not differ until they came to have knowledge.
Your Lord will assuredly settle their differences on the Day of Resurrection.
If you are in doubt of what We have sent down to you, then ask those who have been reading the Book (for a long time) before you.
The truth has indeed come to you from your Lord, so do not be one of those who doubt,
And do not be one of those who deny the signs of God, or you will be among the losers.
Verily those against whom the word of your Lord is pronounced will never believe,
Even though all the signs came to them, not till they face the grievous punishment.
Why has there been no habitation that believed and profited by their faith, except the people of Jonah?
When they came to believe, We removed from them the affliction of shame in the world, and made them prosperous for a time.
If your Lord had willed, all the people on the earth would have come to believe, one and all.
Are you going to compel the people to believe except by God's dispensation?
He puts doubt in (the minds of) those who do not think.
Say: "Observe all there is in the heavens and the earth."
But signs or warnings will be of no avail to those who do not believe.
Can they expect anything but what the people before them had known?
Say: "Then wait. I am waiting with you."
Thus do We deliver our apostles and those who believe.
As a matter of duty We save the believers.
Say: "O men, if you have doubt about my faith, then (know) I do not worship those you worship apart from God, but I worship God who makes you die; and I am commanded to be a believer,
And to set my face toward the way, as one upright, and not be one of those who associate others with God.
And not to invoke any other than God, who can neither help nor hurt me; for if I do, I would surely be unjust.
Should God bring you harm there is none but He who could deliver you from it, and if He wish you good there is none who could take away His blessings: He showers them on those of His creatures as He please, and He is forgiving and kind."
Say: "O men, the truth has come to you from your Lord, so he who follows the right path does so for himself, and he who goes astray errs against himself, and I am not a guardian over you.
Follow what is revealed to you, and persist until God pronounce His judgement; for He is the best of all judges."
ALIF LAM RA. This is a Book whose verses are indeclinable and distinct, which comes from One who is most wise and all-knowing,
(Proclaiming) that you should worship none but God.
Verily I bring to you from Him a message of warning and rejoicing,
And that you should seek His forgiveness and turn towards Him.
He will bestow the best things of life on you for a time ordained, and favour those with blessings who are worthy of grace.
But if you turn away, I fear the punishment of a terrible Day for you.
To God have you to go back, and He has power over everything.
Look, how they double up their breasts in order to hide from Him.
But when they cover themselves up with their garments, He knows what they hide and what they expose.
Indeed, He knows the secrets of the hearts.
There is not a creature that moves on the earth whose nourishment is not provided by God, whose place of sojourning and depositing is not known to Him.
All things conform to a manifest law.
It is He who created the heavens and the earth In six spans, and has control over the waters (of life) so that he may bring out the best that everyone of you could do.
Yet if you said to them: "You shall certainly be raised from the dead," the unbelievers will say: "This will be nothing but sorcery."
If We defer their punishment for a certain time, they will say: "What is keeping it back?"
And yet, the day it comes, they will not be able to avert it; and what they used to laugh at will encompass them.
If We allow man to enjoy Our favours, and then take them away from him, he becomes despondent and ungrateful.
If We let him taste Our favours after adversity, he says: "Misfortune has left me," and begins to brag and exult,
Except those who endure with patience and do the right, who will have pardon and a great reward.
You may haply omit some of what has been revealed to you, and may be disheartened because they say: "Why was no treasure sent down to him, or an angel accompanied him?"
Yet you have been sent to warn alone, for God takes care of everything.
Do they say (of the Prophet): "He has forged (the Qur'an)?"
Say: "Then bring ten Surahs like it, and call anyone except God to help you, if what you say is true."
If they do not answer you, then know it has been revealed with the knowledge of God, and that there is no god but He.
(And say:) "Will you now submit?"
To those who desire the life of this world and its many allures, We shall pay them in full for their acts herein and will not withold any thing.
Yet these are the people for whom there is nothing but Fire in the world to come. Fruitless will be what they have fashioned, and whatever they have done will perish.
Will he who has a clear proof from his Lord, which acts as evidence from Him, before which the Book of Moses was a way-giver and a grace, (not believe in it)?
Whoever among the partisans does not believe in it shall have Hell as the promised award.
So have no doubt about it, for surely it's the truth from your Lord, though most men may not believe.
Who is more wicked than he who invents lies about God?
Such men shall be arraigned before their Lord, and the witnesses will testify: "These are those who imputed lies to God."
Beware!
The scourge of God will fall on the unjust,
Who obstruct others from the way of God and seek obliquity in it, and do not believe in the life to come.
They shall not weaken (the power of) God on earth, nor find any other protector but God.
Their punishment will be doubled, for they could neither hear nor see.
They are verily those who exceeded themselves, and the (gods) they invented abandoned them.
Undoubtedly they will be losers in the life to come.
But those who believe and do things good, and are humble before their Lord, are men of Paradise where they will abide for ever.
The semblance of these two groups is that of a man who is deaf and blind, and the other who can hear and see.
Can they be equal?
Why do you not reflect?
We sent Noah to his people (and he said): "I give you a clear warning.
Do not worship anyone but God; for I fear the punishment of a dreadful day for you."
The leaders of the people who were unbelievers, replied: "We see that you are but a man like us, and see that none among us follows you but the meanest and immature of judgement, and do not see any excellence in you above us. In fact, we think you are a liar."
He said: "O my people, think. If I have a clear proof from my Lord, and He has bestowed on me His grace, though unknown to you, can we force it upon you when you are averse?
I do not demand for it any wealth from you, O my people.
My reward is with God.
And I will not drive those away who believe.
They have also to meet their Lord.
But I see you are an ignorant people.
O my people, who will save me from God if I drive them away?
Do you not understand?
I say not that I have the treasures of God, or that I possess the knowledge of the unknown.
I do not claim to be an angel, nor can I say that God will not bestow any good on those you disdain, for God is cognisant of what is in their hearts. If I say this, I will surely be unjust."
They said: "O Noah, you have argued with us, and disputed at length; so bring that (retribution) you promise, if you speak the truth."
He replied: "Only God will bring it on you if He please, and you cannot prevail against Him.
Even if I wish to advise you aright, my counsel will not profit you if God intend that you go astray, for He is your Lord and to Him you will return."
Do they say you have fabricated it?
Tell them: "If I have fabricated it, then mine is the guilt; but I am clear of what you are guilty."
And Noah was informed through revelation: "Apart from those who have come to believe already not one of your people is going to believe. So grieve not for what they are doing.
Build an ark under Our eye and as We instruct. Do not plead for those who have been wicked, for they shall certainly be drowned."
So he built the ark; and when groups of his people passed by him, they scoffed at him.
He said to them: "Though you laugh at us (now), we shall laugh at you, as you are laughing at us.
You will soon come to know who suffers the punishment that would put him to shame, and who suffers lasting torment."
When Our command was issued and the waters gushed forth from the source, We said: "Take into (the ark) a pair of every species, and members of your family other than those against whom the sentence has been passed already, and those who come to believe."
But only a few believed in him.
And (Noah) said: "Embark.
In the name of God be its course and mooring.
My Lord is surely forgiving and kind."
It sailed on waves like mountains (high), and Noah called to his son who was separated from him: "Embark with us, O my son, and be not one of those who do not believe."
"I shall go up a mountain," he said, "which will keep me from the water."
"There is no getting away," said Noah, "from the decree of God today, except for those on whom be His mercy."
And a wave came between them, and he was among those who were drowned.
Then it was said: "O earth, swallow back your water; and, O sky, desist."
And the water subsided, and the decree was accomplished.
The ark came to rest on Judi (Mount Ararat), and it was said: "Away with the cursed people!"
Noah called on his Lord and said: "O Lord, my son is surely a member of my family, and verily Your promise is true, as You are the most just of all judges."
"O Noah", He answered, "truly he is not of your family. He is surely the outcome of an unrighteous act.
So ask Me not of what you do not know.
I warn you not to be one of the ignorant."
"Preserve me, O Lord," said (Noah), "from asking You that of which I have no knowledge.
If You do not forgive me and have mercy on me I shall be among those who perish."
(And the Lord) said: "O Noah, disembark with peace and safety from Us and blessings on you and the people with you.
As for some (of them), We shall bestow advantages for a time, then send a grievous punishment on them."
This is news of the Unknown We reveal to you, which neither you nor your people knew before.
So endure with patience.
The future is for those who keep away from evil and follow the straight path.
We sent to the people of 'Ad their brother Hud, who said: "O my people, worship God; you have no other god but He.
(As for the idols,) you are only inventing lies.
O my people, I ask no recompense of you for it: My reward is with Him who created me.
Will you not, therefore, understand?
O my people, beg your Lord to forgive you, and turn to Him in repentance. He will send down rain in torrents for you from the shies, and give you added strength.
So do not turn away from Him as sinners."
They said: "O Hud, you have come to us with no proofs. We shall not abandon our gods because you say so, nor believe in you.
All we can say is that some of our gods have smitten you with evil."
He replied:" I call God to witness, and you be witness too, that I am clear of what you associate (in your affairs)
Apart from Him. Contrive against me as much as you like, and give me no respite.
I place my trust in God who is my Lord and your Lord.
There is no creature that moves on the earth who is not held by the forelock firmly by Him.
Verily the way of my Lord is straight.
If you turn away, then (remember) I have delivered to you the message I was sent with. My Lord will put other people in your place, and you will not be able to prevail against Him.
Indeed my Lord keeps a watch over all things."
So, when Our command was issued We rescued Hud by Our grace, and those who believed, with him, and saved them from a dreadful doom.
These were the people of 'Ad who denied the word of their Lord and rebelled against His apostles, and followed the bidding of every perverse tyrant.
So they were accursed in the world, and they will be damned on the Day of Doom. Beware!
The 'Ad turned away from their Lord.
Accursed are the people of 'Ad who were Hud's. To Thamud We Sent their brother Saleh.
"O my people," he said, "worship God; you have no other god but He.
It is He who raised you from the earth and settled you upon it.
So beg your Lord to forgive you, and turn to Him in repentance. Surely my Lord is near and answers."
They said: "O Saleh, we had placed our hopes in you, but you forbid us from worshipping that which our fathers worshipped, and we are suspicious of what you are calling us to."
He said: "O my people, have you considered that if my Lord has clearly shown me the way, and I have His blessings too, who will save me then from God if I disobey?
You will only add to my ruin.
O my people, this she-camel of God is a token for you. So leave her alone to graze on God's earth, and do not molest her, otherwise the swiftest punishment would befall you."
But they hamstrung her. Then (Saleh) said: "You have but three days to enjoy life in your homes.
Infallible is this promise.
So, when Our command (of punishment) came We delivered Saleh by Our grace, and those who believed, with him, from the disgrace of that day.
Verily your Lord is mighty and powerful.
The sinners were seized by a blast from heaven, and lay overturned in their homes in the morning,
As though they had never lived there at all. Beware!
The people of Thamud turned away from their Lord. Beware!
Our angels came to Abraham with good news, and said: "Peace on you.
"Peace on you too," said Abraham, and hastened to bring a roasted calf.
When they did not stretch their hands towards it he became suspicious and afraid of them.
They said: "Do not be afraid. We have been sent to the people of Lot."
His wife who stood near, laughed as We gave her the good news of Isaac, and after Isaac of Jacob.
She said: "Woe betide me!
Will I give birth when I am old and this my husband be aged?
This is indeed surprising!"
"Why are you surprised at the command of God?
God's mercy and blessings be upon you, O members of this household," they said.
"Verily He is worthy of praise and glory."
When Abraham's fear was dispelled, and the good news had come to him, he pleaded for the people of Lot with Us.
Abraham was kind, compassionate, and penitent.
"Desist from pleading, O Abraham," (they said).
"Your Lord's command has verily been issued, and a punishment that cannot be averted is bound to fall on them."
So when Our angels came to Lot, he grieved for them, and felt powerless to help them, and said: "This is a day of sorrow.
His people came excited to him. They were addicted to sin already.
Said (Lot): "O my people, these daughters of mine are cleaner (and lawful) for you. Have fear of God, and do not shame me before my guests.
Is there no man of discernment among you?"
They said: "You know we have no need for your daughters, and know well what we want."
"I wish I had the power to resist you," said (Lot), "or powerful support."
(The angels) said: "O Lot, we have verily been sent by your Lord.
They will never be able to harm you.
So, leave late at night with your family, and none of you should turn back to look; but your wife will suffer (the fate) they are going to suffer.
Their hour of doom is in the morning: Is not the morning nigh?"
So when the decreed moment arrived, We turned the habitations upside down, and rained upon them stones of hardened lava in quick succession,
Impressed with (the signs) of your Lord.
And such (punishment) is not far for the (other) transgressers.
We sent to Midian their brother Shu'aib.
He said: "O my people, worship God; you have no other god but He.
So do not give in short measure nor underweigh.
I see you are prosperous, but I fear the doom of an overwhelming Day for you.
So, O my people, weigh and measure with justness, and do not withhold things due to men, and do not spread corruption in the land, despoiling it.
That which is left to you by God is better, if you are true believers; yet I am not a warden over you."
They said: "O Shu'aib, does your piety teach that we should abandon what our fathers worshipped, or desist from doing what we like with our goods?
How gracious a man of discernment you are indeed!"
He said: "O my people, think. I have a clear sign from my Lord, who has also given me a goodly provision, and I do not wish for myself what I forbid you: I only wish to reform you as best I can.
My success is from God alone.
In Him I have placed my trust, and to Him I turn.
"O my people (I fear) lest your opposition to me should bring you the like of what befell the people of Noah or Hud or Saleh; and the people of Lot are not distant from you.
"Beg your Lord to forgive you, and turn to Him.
Indeed my Lord is compassionate and loving."
They said: "O Shu'aib, much of what you say is meaningless to us, and then (for sure) you are powerless among us.
But for your clan we would have stoned you to death.
You have no power over us.
He said: "My clan seems mightier to you than God whom you neglect and push behind your backs.
Surely what you do is within the power of my Lord.
Do on your part what you can, O people, I will do what I will. You will come to know who suffers the punishment that would put him to shame, and who is the liar.
So watch; I am watching with you."
And when Our word came to pass, We rescued Shu'aib and those who believed, with him, by Our grace, but those who were wicked were seized by a punishment from heaven, and lay overturned in their homes in the morning.
As though they had not dwelt there at all.
Beware! Condemmed were the people of Midian as those of Thamud had been before them!
We sent Moses with Our signs and full authority
To the Pharaoh and his nobles, but they followed the bidding of Pharaoh, though the bidding of Pharaoh was unrightful.
He shall be at the head of his people on the Day of Resurrection, and drive them into Hell like cattle driven to water -- what an evil watering-place to reach!
Damned will they be in this world, and on the Day of Doom how evil the gift that they will receive!
These are a few accounts of settlements that We narrate to you.
Some still survive, and some have been mowed down.
We did not wrong them; they wronged themselves. When your Lord's chastisement descended upon them, their gods, on whom they called apart from God, were not of the least avail, and all they did was only to add to their destruction.
Such is the punishment of your Lord when He seizes human settlements in the acts of wickedness.
Surely His hold is grievous and terrible.
In this surely is a sign for him who fears the torment of the Hereafter, the day when mankind will be assembled together, which will be a day when all things would become evident.
We are deferring it only for a time ordained.
The day it comes no soul will dare say a word but by His leave; and some will be wretched, some will be blessed.
And those who are doomed, will be in Hell: For them will be sighing and sobbing,
Where they will dwell so long as heaven and earth endure, unless your Lord will otherwise.
Verily your Lord does as He wills.
Those who are blessed will be in Paradise, where they will dwell so long as heaven and earth survive, unless your Lord wills otherwise: This will be a gift uninterrupted.
So, you should not entertain any doubt about those whom they worship: They only worship what their fathers had worshipped before them. We shall verily give them their meed without diminution.
Verily We gave to Moses the Book, but there was disagreement about it. Had the decree of your Lord (delaying it) not been issued the matter would have been settled between them.
Surely your Lord will reward everyone in accordance with his deeds.
He is certainly aware of all they do.
So, you and those who turned to God with you, should walk along the straight path as you have been commanded, and do not transgress, for He verily sees whatsoever you do.
Do not lean towards the wicked, or you will be caught in the flames of Hell, and have none to befriend you other than God, nor will you be given help.
Stand up for the service of prayer at the two ends of day and the first watch of night.
Remember that good deeds nullify the bad.
This is a reminder for those who are observant.
Be steadfast, for verily God does not let the reward of those who are upright and do good to go waste.
If only there had been men endued with virtue in the ages before you, who could preserve men from doing evil in the world, other than the few We saved from among them.
Those who were wicked followed that which made them dissolute, and became sinners.
Your Lord would not surely destroy unjustly human habitations so long as the people are righteous.
But if your Lord had pleased He could have made all human beings into one community of belief. But they would still have differed from one another,
Except those on whom your Lord had mercy for which He has created them.
But fulfilled shall be the word of your Lord. "I will fill up Hell with jinns and men."
The histories of apostles that We relate to you are (meant) to strengthen your heart.
Through them has the truth come to you, and guidance, and reminder to those who believe.
Say to the infidels. "Act as best you can, we are acting too;
And wait (for what is to come), we are also waiting (to see)."
To God belong the secrets of the heavens and the earth, and all things will go back to Him.
So worship Him and put your trust in Him; your Lord is not heedless of what you do.
ALIF LAM RA. These are the verses of the immaculate Book.
We have sent it down as a clear discourse that you may understand.
Through the revelation of this Qur'an We narrate the best of histories of which you were unaware before.
When Joseph told his father: "O my father, I saw eleven stars and the sun and the moon bowing before me in homage,"
He said: "O son, do not narrate your dream to your brothers, or they will plot against you. Surely Satan is man's acknowledged foe.
Your Lord will choose you and teach you to interpret events, and confer His favours on you and the house of Jacob, as He had done in the case of two ancestors of yours, Abraham and Isaac, before you.
Indeed your Lord is all-knowing and all-wise."
In the story of Joseph and his brothers are lessons for those who inquire.
"Surely Joseph and his brother are dearer to our father than we," (said his half brothers) "even though we are a well-knit band.
Our father is surely in the wrong.
Let us kill Joseph or cast him in some distant land so that we may get our father's exclusive affection; then play innocent."
One of them said: "If you must do so, then do not kill Joseph, but throw him into an unused well. Some passing caravan may rescue him."
(Then going to their father) they said: "O father, why don't you trust us with Joseph? We are in fact his well-wishers.
Let him go out with us tomorrow that he may enjoy and play. We shall take care of him."
He said: "I am afraid of sending him with you lest a wolf should devour him when you are unmindful."
They replied: "If a wolf should devour him when we are there, a well-knit band, we shall certainly be treacherous."
So, when they took him out they planned to throw him into an unused well. We revealed to Joseph: "You will tell them (one day) of this deed when they will not apprehend it."
At nightfall they came to their father weeping,
And said: "We went racing with one another and left Joseph to guard our things when a wolf devoured him. But you will not believe us even though we tell the truth."
They showed him the shirt with false blood on it.
(Their father) said: "It is not so; you have made up the story.
Yet endurance is best.
I seek the help of God alone for what you impute."
A caravan happened to pass, and sent the water-carrier to bring water from the well.
He let down his bucket (and pulled Joseph up with it).
"What luck," said the man; "here is a boy;" and they hid him as an item of merchandise; but what they did was known to God.
And they sold him as worthless for a few paltry dirham.
The Egyptian who bought him instructed his wife: "House him honourably.
He may be of use to us. We may even adopt him as a son."
So, We firmly established Joseph in the land, and taught him the interpretation of dreams.
God dominated in his affairs, though most men do not know.
When he reached the prime of life We gave him wisdom and knowledge.
Thus We reward those who are good.
But she in whose house he resided wished to seduce him and, closing the doors, said: "Come into me.
"God forbid!" he said; "he is my master who has approved my stay.
Surely those who act wrongly do not prosper."
But the woman desired him, and he would have desired her but for the indication he received from his Lord.
This was so that We may avert both evil and lechery from him, for he was one of Our chosen devotees.
Both of them raced to the door, and she (grabbed and) rent his shirt from behind.
They met her lord outside the door. "There is no other penalty for a man," said she, "who wanted to outrage your wife but imprisonment or grievous punishment."
(Joseph) said: "It was she who wanted to seduce me."
And a witness from her family testified: "If the shirt is torn from the front then the woman is speaking the truth, and he is a liar.
But if the shirt is torn from behind then she is a liar, and he speaks the truth."
When the husband saw the shirt torn at the back, he said: "Surely this is a woman's ruse, and the wiles of women are great.
Ignore this affair, O Joseph; and you, O woman, ask forgiveness for your sin, for you were surely errant."
In the city the women gossiped: "The minister's wife longs after her page. He has captured her heart.
We think she is in clear error."
When she heard their slanderings, she sent for them and prepared a banquet, and gave each of them a knife (for paring fruit), and called (to Joseph): "Come out before them."
When they saw him, the women were so wonderstruck they cut their hands, and exclaimed: "O Lord preserve us!
He is no mortal but an honourable angel."
She said: "This is the one you blamed me for.
I did desire his person, but he preserved himself from sin.
Yet in case he does not do my bidding he will be put into prison and disgraced."
(Joseph) prayed: "O Lord, dearer is prison than what they invite me to. Unless You turn their guiles away from me I shall succumb to their charms and thus become a pagan."
His Lord heard his prayer, and averted the women's wiles from him.
He verily hears and knows everything.
And yet in spite of having seen these clear proofs they found it proper to incarcerate him for a time.
Two other youths were imprisoned along with him.
Said one of them: "I dreamt that I was pressing grapes;" and the other: "I dreamt that I was carrying bread on my head, and the birds were pecking at it.
You tell us the meaning of this. You seem to be a righteous man."
(Joseph) answered: "I will give you its interpretation before the food you are served arrives.
This knowledge is one of the things my Lord has taught me.
I have given up the religion of those who do not believe in God and deny the life to come.
I follow the faith of my fathers, of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob.
We cannot associate anyone with God.
This is among God's favours to us and to all mankind; but most men are not grateful.
(Tell me) O fellow-prisoners, are a number of gods better, or one God omnipotent?
(What) you worship besides Him are nothing but names that you and your fathers have assigned, for which no sanction has been sent down by God.
Authority belongs to God alone.
He commands that you worship none but Him.
This is the right way; but most men are ignorant.
O fellow-prisoners, one of you will serve wine to your master, the other will be crucified and the birds will peck at his brain.
Determined is the matter of your inquiry."
And (Joseph) asked the man he knew would be released: "Remember me to your lord;" but Satan made him forget to mention this to his lord, and Joseph remained in prison for a number of years.
(One day) the king said (to his courtiers): "I saw seven fat cows in a dream being devoured by seven lean ones, and seven ears of corn that were green and seven others that were seared.
O courtiers, tell me the significance of my dream, if you know how to interpret them."
"They were only confused dreams," they said; "we do not know how to interpret them."
Then the servant, who of the two had been released, remembering (Joseph), said: "I will give you its interpretation; let me go for it."
(And coming to the prison) he said: "O Joseph the truthful, tell us (the meaning of) seven fat cows being devoured by seven lean ones, and seven green ears of corn and seven seared, that I may go back to the people and tell them."
He said: "Sow as usual for seven years, and after reaping leave the corn in the ears, except the little you need for food.
Then there will come seven years of hardship which will consume the grain you had laid up against them, except a little you may have stored away.
This will be followed by a year of rain, and people shall press (the grapes)."
The king said: "Bring him to me.
So when the messenger came to Joseph, he said: "Go back to your lord and ask him: 'How fare the women who had cut their hands?' My Lord is cognisant of their guile."
The king asked the women: "What was the affair of seducing Joseph?"
"God preserve us," they said; "we know no evil against him."
The wife of the minister said: "The truth has now come out.
It was I who desired to seduce him, but he is indeed a man of virtue." --
(At this Joseph remarked:) "From this (the Minister) should know that I did not betray him in his absence, and that God does not surely let the wiles of those who betray ever succeed.
But I do not wish to absolve myself, for the soul is prone to evil, unless my Lord have mercy.
Indeed my Lord is forgiving and kind." --
When the king heard this he said: "Bring him to me. I shall take him in my special service."
When he had talked to him, he said: "Today you are established in a rank of trust with us."
"Appoint me over the granaries of the land," (he said); "I shall be a knowledgeable keeper."
Thus We gave Joseph authority in the land so that he lived wherever he liked.
We bestow Our favours on whomsoever We please, and do not allow the reward of those who are good to go waste.
And certainly the recompense of the life to come is better for those who believe and follow the right path.
The brothers of Joseph came (to Egypt) and visited him. He recognised them, though they did not recognise him.
When he had supplied their provisions, he said to them: "Bring your (half) brother with you.
Have you not seen that I have given full measure, and that I am the best of hosts?
But if you do not bring him with you, then I shall have no grain for you, nor should you come back to me."
They said: "We shall request his father, and will certainly do that."
Then he ordered his servants: "Put their money back in their packs: They may find it on reaching home, and perhaps come again."
When they returned to their father, they said: "O father, a further measure has been denied us. So send our brother with us that he may bring more grain.
He replied: "Should I trust you with him as I did his brother?
But God is the best of guardians, and most merciful of all."
When they unpacked their goods they said: "O father, what more can we ask?
Look, even our money has been returned.
We shall go and bring a camel-load more of grain for our family, and take good care of our brother.
That will be an easy measure."
He said: "I will never send him with you until you swear by God that you will bring him back to me, unless all of you are overtaken (by misfortune)."
When they had given their promise, he said: "God is witness to our conversation."
(As they were leaving) their father said to them: "O my sons, do not seek one approach but employ different ways (of attaining your object). If anything should befall you from God I shall not be able to avert it, for all authority belongs to God.
I have placed my trust in Him, and the trusting should rely on Him alone."
When they entered as their father had advised them, nothing could avail them against (the will of) God, yet it confirmed a premonition Jacob had, for verily he had knowledge as We had taught him, though most men do not know.
When they came to Joseph he made his brother his guest, and said: "I am your brother.
So do not grieve for what they had done."
When he had given them their provisions he put his goblet in his brother's saddle-bag.
Then a crier announced: "O men of the caravan, you are thieves."
They turned to them and asked: "What is it you have lost?"
"We cannot find the master's goblet. Whoever comes up with it will be given a camel-load of grain; I vouch for it."
They said: "We swear by God. You know we did not come to commit any crime in the land, nor are we thieves."
"What should be the punishment," they were asked, "in case you are liars?"
"The punishment for that (should be)," they said, "that he in whose luggage it is found should be held as punishment.
This is how we repay the wrong-doers."
So he searched their saddle-bags before his brother's, then produced the cup from his brother's bag.
That is how We planned an excuse for Joseph, for under the law of the king he could not detain his brother unless God so willed.
We raise the status of whom We please. Over every man of knowledge there is one more knowing.
Said the brothers: "If he has stolen (no wonder), his brother had stolen before."
But Joseph kept this secret and did not disclose it to them, and said (to himself): "You are worse in the degree of evil, for God knows better of what you allege."
They said: "O Minister, he has an aged father, so keep one of us in his place. We see you are a virtuous man."
"May God forgive us," he said, "if we hold any one but him with whom we found our property, or else we would be unjust."
When they despaired of (persuading) him, they went aside to confer.
The oldest of them said: "You know that your father has pledged you in the name of God, and you have been guilty of iniquity in the case of Joseph before.
I will not leave this place unless my father permits or God decides for me, for He is the best of all judges.
So, go to your father and tell him: 'O father, your son has committed a theft. We bear witness to only what we know; we could not prevent the unknown.
Enquire from the people of that city, or ask the men of the caravan with whom we have come. We are verily speaking the truth.'"
"No," said (the father).
"You have made up the story; but patience is best; God may bring them back to me. He is all-knowing and all-wise."
He turned away from them and cried: "Alas for Joseph!"
And his eyes turned white with grief which he bore in silence.
"By God," said they, "you will never stop thinking of Joseph till you are consumed or perish."
He replied: "I cry my plaint and grief to God, and know from God what you do not know.
O sons, go in search of Joseph and his brother, and do not despair of the mercy of God. Only they despair of God's mercy who do not believe."
When they returned to him, they said (to Joseph): "O Minister, calamity has befallen us and our people. We have brought but a meagre sum, but give us full measure as alms bestowed.
God surely rewards those who give alms."
, He said: "Do you know what you did to Joseph and his brother in your ignorance?"
They said: "Surely you are not Joseph!"
"I am Joseph," he said, "and this is my brother.
God has been gracious to us; for God does not verily deprive those who fear Him and are patient of the recompense of those who are good."
They said: "By God, God has favoured you above us, for we have indeed been sinners."
"There is no blame on you today," he said, "May God forgive you.
He is the most merciful of all.
Take my shirt and put it on my father's face; his eyesight will be restored; and bring your entire family to me."
The caravan departed (from Egypt) and Jacob said (at home): "Say not that I am in my dotage, but I get the smell of Joseph."
They said: "By God, you are still persisting in your old delusion."
Then, as the harbinger of happy news arrived and put the garment over his face his eyesight was restored.
He said: "Did I not tell you? I know from God what you do not know."
Said (the sons): "O our father, pray for us that our sins be forgiven, for we are really sinners."
"I will ask my Lord to forgive you," he replied, "for He is forgiving and kind."
When they went back to Joseph he gave his father and mother a place of honour, and said: "Enter Egypt in peace by the will of God."
He seated his parents by his side on the throne; and they fell down before him in homage.
"O my father," said Joseph, "this is the meaning of my earlier dream.
My Lord has made it come true.
He was gracious in getting me out of the prison, and bringing you out of the desert to me after the discord created by Satan between me and my brothers, for my Lord is gracious to whomsoever He please. He is indeed all-knowing and all-wise.
O my Lord, you have given me dominion and taught me the interpretation of dreams; O Creator of the heavens and the earth, You alone are my saviour in this world and the world to come; let me die submitting to You, and place me among the upright."
This is news of the unknown We reveal to you, for you were not present when Joseph's brothers agreed on their course of action, and devised their plot.
Many men will not believe howsoever you wish,
Even though you ask no recompense (for it).
It is only a warning for all mankind.
How many a sign there is in the heavens and the earth which most men pass by and ignore,
Not only do they not believe in God, but also associate others with Him.
Do they really believe that an all-embracing punishment of God will not come upon them, or the Day of Doom overtake them suddenly while they remain unaware?
Say: "My way, and that of my followers, is to call you to God with full perception.
All glory to God, I am not an idolater."
All the apostles We had sent before you were men of those regions, to whom We sent Our revelations.
Have they not travelled on the earth and seen what befell the people before them?
Surely the abode of the Hereafter is better for those who fear straying from the right path.
Do you not understand?
When the apostles despaired and thought they were made false promises, Our help arrived, and We delivered whom We pleased; but never will Our punishment be averted from the sinners.
Verily in their accounts is a lesson for men of wisdom.
This is not a fictitious tale, but a verification of earlier Books, and a clear exposition of everything, and a guidance and grace for those who believe.
ALIF LAM MIM RA.
These are the verses of the Scripture.
Whatsoever is sent down to you from your Lord is the truth; but most men do not believe.
It is God who raised the skies without support, as you can see, then assumed His throne, and enthralled the sun and the moon (so that) each runs to a predetermined course. He disposes all affairs, distinctly explaining every sign that you may be certain of the meeting with your Lord.
It is He who stretched the earth and placed upon it stabilisers and rivers; and made two of a pair of every fruit; (and) He covers up the day with the night.
In these are signs for those who reflect.
On the earth are tracts adjoining one another, and vineyards, fields of corn and date-palm trees, some forked, some with single trunks, yet all irrigated by the self-same water, though We make some more excellent than the others in fruit.
There are surely signs in them for those who understand.
If you are surprised, then astonishing is the speech (of those who say:) "Having turned to dust shall we be raised as a new creation?"
They are the ones who deny their Lord, and they will have collars around their necks. They are the inmates of Hell, where they will abide for ever.
They want you to hasten the evil before the good, even when there have been examples of retribution before them.
Though certainly your Lord forgives human beings for their iniquities, your Lord is severe of retribution.
The unbelievers say: "Why no miracle was sent down to him by his Lord?"
But you are only a bearer of warnings, and a guide for every nation.
God is cognisant of what every female carries in her womb, or what the wombs want or exceed (of their disburdening time).
With Him all things are in determined measure.
He is the knower of the known and the unknown, the mighty and most high.
He who keeps his secret among you is the same to Him as he who speaks out publicly, and he who hides himself in the night and walks freely in the day.
His angels keep watch over him in succession (night and day), in front and behind, by God's command.
Verily God does not change the state of a people till they change themselves.
When God intends misfortune for a people no one can avert it, and no saviour will they have apart from Him.
It is He who makes the lightning flash for fear and hope, and raises massive clouds.
The thunder sings His praises, and the angels too, for awe of Him.
He sends thunder-bolts and strikes whosoever He will with them: Even then it is God they contend about! But mighty is He in (His) power.
To call on Him is true (supplication). For those they invoke other than Him do not answer them at all, except like a man who stretches his hands towards the water that it reach his mouth, but it will never reach it.
Not more than error are the prayers of infidels.
Whosoever is in the heavens and on earth bows to God in submission with a will or perforce, as do their shadows in the morning and evening.
Ask them: "Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth?"
(They will) say: "God."
Say: "Then why do you take protectors besides Him who have no power over their own gain or loss?"
Say: "Can a blind man and one who can see be equal?
Or, darkness and light be the same?
Or, have those they have appointed equal of God created, as He has created, so that the (two) creations look alike to them?"
Say: "God is the creator of everything. He is One, the omnipotent."
He sends down water from the skies, which flows in channels according to their capacity, with the scum borne on the surface of the torrent, as rises the scum when metals are heated on the fire for making ornaments and household utensils.
This is how God determines truth and falsehood.
The scum disappears like the foam on the bank, and that which is useful to man remains on the earth.
That is how God sets forth precepts of wisdom.
For those who obey their Lord is excellence. For those who fail to obey, the reckoning will be hard, even if they possess and give as ransom all that there is on the earth, and as much more; and Hell will be their abode: How wretched is its wide expanse!
Can a man who knows what has been revealed to you from your Lord is the truth, and one who cannot see, be the same?
They alone take warning who are wise,
Who fulfil their covenant with God and do not break their agreement,
Who keep together what God has ordained held together, and fear their Lord and dread the hardship of the Reckoning,
Who persevere in seeking the way of their Lord, who fulfil their devotional obligations, and spend of what We have given them, secretly or openly, who repel evil with good: For them is the recompense of Paradise:
Perpetual gardens which they will enter with those of their fathers, spouses and children who were virtuous and at peace, with angels coming in through every door
Saying: "(Welcome,) peace on you, for you persevered." How excellent the recompense of Paradise!
As for those who break God's covenant after validating it, and sever relations which God ordained cohered, and spread corruption in the land, there is condemnation for them and an evil abode.
God increases or decreases the fortunes of whosoever He will, and they rejoice in the life of this world.
Yet the life of this world is nothing but a merchandise as compared to the life of the next.
The unbelievers say: "How is it that no miracle was sent down to him by his Lord?"
Say: "God leads whosoever He wills astray, and guides whoever turns to Him in repentance.
Those who believe and find peace in their hearts from the contemplation of God: Surely there is peace of heart in the contemplation of God!"
Those who believe and do the right, have happiness, and an excellent resting place.
That is how We have sent you to a people before whom many a people have come and gone, so that you may announce to them whatever We have revealed to you. But they do not believe in Ar-Rahman.
Tell them: "He is my Lord. There is no other god but He.
In Him have I placed my trust, and to Him is my reversion."
Had there been a Qur'an which could have made the mountains move, or the earth to cleave asunder, or the dead to speak, yet all authority belongs to God.
Have the believers not learnt that if God had so willed He could have guided all mankind?
As for unbelievers, they will be visited by misfortune endlessly for what they have done; or it would sit in their homes till the promised threat of God comes to pass.
Surely God does not go back on His promise.
Many an apostle have they mocked before you; but I allowed the unbelievers respite, then I seized them.
How severe was My punishment then!
Who is it who stands (watch) over every soul for what it does?
Yet they ascribe compeers to God.
Say: "Then name them.
Or are you announcing to God what He does not know on the earth?
Or is it only empty talk?
In fact, the unbelievers' plots are made to look attractive to them, so that they are held back from the right path.
Whosoever God allows to go astray has none to show him the way.
For them is punishment in this world; and the punishment of the world to come is far more severe. They will have no one to save them from God.
The likeness of Paradise promised the pious and devout is (of a garden) with streams of rippling water, everlasting fruits and shade.
This is the recompense of those who keep away from evil; but the recompense of those who deny the truth is Hell.
Those to whom We have given the Scriptures rejoice in what We have sent down to you; but some of their factions reject some of it.
Tell them: "I am commanded to worship only God, and not to associate compeers with Him.
To Him I call you, and to Him is the destination."
That is how We have sent down this (Qur'an) as a code of clear judgement.
But if you follow their caprices, now that you have been given knowledge, you will have no friend or protector against God.
We sent many apostles before you, and bestowed on them wives and children, but it was not for any apostle to come up with a miracle unless by the leave of God.
For every age there is a law.
God abrogates or confirms whatsoever He will, for He has with Him the Book of Books.
Whether We allow you to see (the punishment) We have promised them, or end your life before (its execution), it is certainly for you to convey the message; the reckoning is for Us to do.
Do they not see Us advancing from all sides into their land and reducing its frontiers?
It is for God to judge; and there is none to reverse His judgement.
He is swift at reckoning.
Surely those who had gone before them had also plotted; but God's is all the planning, for He has knowledge of what each does.
The unbelievers will soon learn for whom is the guerdon of Paradise.
Yet those who are disbelievers say: "You are not the apostle sent (by God)."
Tell them: "God is sufficient as witness between me and you, and he who has knowledge of the Book."
ALIF LAM RA. A Book We have sent down to you that you may lead men out of darkness into light, by their Lord's command, to the path of the mighty, the worthy of praise.
God, to whom belongs all there is in the heavens and the earth.
Woe to the unbelievers for the terrible punishment (that awaits).
Those who hold the life of this world dearer than that of the next, who obstruct the path of God and seek obliquity in it, have wandered far into error.
We never sent a messenger who did not speak the tongue of his people, that he may explain to them distinctly.
God leads whosoever He wills astray, and shows whoever He wills the way: He is all-mighty and all-wise.
Remember when We sent Moses with Our signs (We said): "Bring your people out of darkness into light, and remind them of the visitations of God.
Indeed there are signs in this for every steadfast, thankful soul"
So Moses said to his people: "Remember the favours of God when He saved you from the people of Pharaoh who afflicted you with oppression, slaying your sons but keeping alive your women, which was a great trial from your Lord."
Remember, your Lord proclaimed: "I shall give you more if you are grateful; but if you are thankless then surely My punishment is very great."
And Moses said: "What if you and all the people of the world deny, God is unconcerned and worthy of praise."
Has not the news of those before you, the people of Noah and 'Ad and Thamud, and those who came after them, come to you?
None knows (about) them except God.
Their apostles came to them with clear proofs, but they tried to silence them and said: "We do not believe in what you have been sent with, and we are in doubt of what you call us to, about which we are in disquiet.'
Said their apostles: "Can there be doubt about God, the originator of the heavens and the earth?
He calls you to forgive some of your sins, and give you respite for a time ordained."
They said: "You are only men like us, and yet you wish to turn us away from what our fathers worshipped.
Bring to us then a clear proof."
Their apostles said to them: "Indeed we are men like you, but God bestows His favours on whomsoever He wills among His creatures.
It is not in our power to bring a miracle for you without the leave of God.
The believers should only place their trust in God.
And why should we not repose our trust in God when He has shown us our paths of duty to Him?
We shall bear with fortitude the hardships you inflict upon us. The trusting place their trust in God."
The unbelievers said to their apostles: "We shall drive you out of our land, or else you come back to our fold."
Their Lord then communicated to them: "We shall annihilate these wicked people,
And establish you in their place.
This is for him who fears My station, and dreads My commination."
Then (the apostles) asked of God's assistance, and every arrogant tyrant was frustrated:
Before him is Hell, and he will get putrid liquid to drink.
He will sip it, yet will not be able to gulp it down.
Death will crowd in upon him from every side, but die he will not.
A terrible torment trails him.
Like ashes are the deeds of those who deny their Lord, which the wind blows away on a windy day.
They shall have no power over what they earned.
This is the farthest limit of going astray.
Do you not see that God has created the heavens and the earth with ultimate reason?
If He so wills He could take you away from the earth and raise a new creation (in your place).
This is well within the power of God.
When they will all appear before God together, the weak will say to those who were arrogant: "We were your followers, so can you now save us a little from God's punishment?"
They will say: "If we had been guided by God we would surely have shown you the way.
To lament or endure is all the same to us now. No getting away is there for us."
When the reckoning is over Satan will say: "The promise that was made to you by God was indeed a true promise; but I went back on the promise I had made, for I had no power over you except to call you; and you responded to my call.
So blame me not, but blame yourselves.
Neither can I help you nor can you give me help.
I disavow your having associated me earlier (with God).
The punishment for those who are wicked is painful indeed."
Those who believed and did the right, will be admitted to gardens with rivers flowing by, where they will abide by the leave of their Lord, with 'Peace' as their salutation.
Do you not see how God compares a noble act to a healthy tree whose roots are firm and branches in the sky, which yields
By the leave of its Lord its fruit in all seasons, God presents words of wisdom to men that they might reflect.
An evil act is like a rotten tree torn out of the earth with no (base or) firmness.
With immutuble words God makes the faithful dauntless in the life of the world and the life to come, but leads the unjust into error, for God does as He pleases.
Have you not looked at those who repaid God's favours with ingratitude; who pulled their people down to ruin,
Hell, where they will roast in the fire? And what an evil repository!
They have appointed equals of God to mislead people from His path.
Tell them: "Enjoy yourselves (so long as you may). In the end you have to go to Hell."
Tell those of My creatures who believe: "Observe your devotional obligations and give of what We have given you in charity, secretly or openly, before the Day arrives when there will be no buying or selling or befriending."
It is God who created the heavens and the earth, and sent down rain from the sky producing fruits for your food thereby, and made you master of the ships that ply in the oceans by His command, subjected the rivers to your control,
And subjugated the sun and moon for you so that they perform their tasks diligently; and subdued the night and day for your service.
He gave you whatsoever you asked. If you try to count the favours of God you will not be able to calculate.
Man is most unjust indeed, full of ingratitude.
Remember when Abraham prayed: "O Lord, make this a city of peace, and preserve me and my progeny from worshipping idols:
Many a man have they led astray, O Lord.
So he who follows me is truly of me; but as for him who disobeys me, surely You are forgiving and kind.
I have settled some of my children, O Lord, in a barren valley near Your sacred House, so that, O our Lord, they may be constant in devotion.
So put in the hearts of men some kindness for them, and provide fruits for them: They may haply be grateful.
O Lord, You have knowledge of what we hide and what we reveal, for nothing on the earth or in the skies is hidden from God.
All praise be to God who bestowed on me Ishmael and Isaac in old age.
Verily my Lord listens to prayer.
Grant, O Lord, that I and my offspring may remain constant in devotion.
Grant, O Lord, my supplication.
O Lord, forgive me, my parents and the faithful on the Day the reckoning is done."
Think not God is oblivious of the deeds of the wicked.
He has only allowed them respite till the Day on which all eyes would stare aghast,
(And) they would hasten forward, heads lifted upwards, gazes fixed, and emptied out their hearts.
Warn the people of that Day when the punishment would be inflicted upon them.
Then will the wicked say: "O our Lord, give us respite a while more.
We shall heed Your call and follow the apostles." (But they will be told,): "Are you not those who used to swear: 'There is no reverse for us?'
Yet you dwelt in the dwellings of those who had exceeded themselves, and it was evident to you how We had dealt with them; and We held out examples before you."
Still they are plotting their plots, but evident are their plots to God, even though they are so adroit as to make the mountains move.
Think not that God would go back on His promise (made) to the apostles. Indeed God is mighty, the Lord of retribution.
The day when the earth will he replaced by some other than the earth, as will be the skies, and every one will appear before God the one and omnipotent,
You will see the wicked on that day bound together in chains.
Of molten pitch shall be their garments, their faces covered with flames,
That God may reward each soul for its deeds.
Indeed God is swift at reckoning!
This is a message for mankind that they may take a warning from it, and may know that He is the one and only God, and that men of wisdom may reflect.
ALIF LAM RA. These are the verses of the Book and the perspicuous oration.
The unbelievers would haply like to wish that they had submitted (and become Muslim).
Leave them to feast and revel, beguiled by hope; they will come to know soon.
Not one habitation have We destroyed but at the time determined for it.
No people can hasten or delay the term already fixed for them.
And yet they say: "You, to whom this Exposition has been sent are surely possessed of the Devil.
If you are a man of truth, why can't you bring the angels to us?"
But then We never send the angels down save with the purpose (of enforcing their doom), after which they will not be given more respite.
We have sent down this Exposition, and We will guard it.
We had also sent apostles to people of earlier persuasions.
But never once an apostle came to them at whom they did not scoff.
We place in the hearts of sinners (disbelief).
So, they will not believe in it: The example of former people is there.
Even if We open a door in the heavens and they ascend through it in broad daylight,
They will say all the same: "Our eyes were dazed (and clouded over). We were a people ensorcelled."
We have placed the signs of the Zodiac in the sky, and decked it out for those who can see;
And We have preserved it from every accursed devil,
Except the ones who listen on the sly, yet they are chased away by a shooting flame.
We stretched the earth and placed upon it firm stabilisers, and made all things grow upon it balanced evenly.
We have provided on it sustenance for you, and for those you cannot provide.
Of all things there are We have the stores, and send them down in determined measure.
We send rain-impregnated winds, and water from the sky which you drink, but you are not the keepers of its store.
It is We who give life and We who give death, and We are the One who will abide.
We surely know those of you who go forward and those of you who lag behind.
Your Lord will surely gather them together: Certainly He is all-wise and all-knowing.
Man We fashioned from fermented clay dried tingling hard,
As We fashioned jinns before from intense radiated heat.
But when your Lord said to the angels: "I am verily going to create a human being from fermented clay dried tingling hard;
And when I have fashioned him and breathed into him of My spirit, bow before him in homage;"
The angels bowed in homage in a body
Except Iblis. He refused to bow with the adorers.
"How is it, O Iblis," said (the Lord), "you did not join those who bowed in homage?"
"How could I bow," said he, "before a mortal whom You created from fermented clay dried tingling hard?"
"Go hence, execrable," (said the Lord), "from this place,
Condemned till the day of Doom!"
"O my Lord," said he, "give me respite till the day the dead are raised."
"You are among the reprieved," (said the Lord),
"Till the predetermined time."
"O my Lord," he said, "since You have led me into error I'll beguile them with the pleasures of the world and lead them astray,
Except the chosen ones among Your creatures."
(To which God) said: "This way is right by Me.
No power shall you have over (all) My creatures except those who fall into error and follow you,
For whom the ordained place is surely Hell,
Which has several gates, and each gate is marked for every section of them."
Verily those who keep away from evil and follow the straight path shall be in the midst of gardens and springs of water.
"Enter in peace and tranquility," (they will be told).
We shall cast out any grudge they may have in their hearts. (There) they will sit on couches face to face like brothers together.
No weariness will come upon them, nor will they be sent away from there.
Announce to My creatures that I am indeed forgiving and kind,
But My punishment is surely a painful one.
Inform them about the matter of Abraham's guests.
When they came to him and said: "Peace," he answered: "Truly we are afraid of you."
"Have no fear," they said. "We bring you news of a son full of wisdom."
"You bring me the good news now," he said, "when old age has come upon me.
What good news are you giving me then?"
"We have given you the happy tidings of a truth," they replied. "So do not be one of those who despair."
"Who would despair of the mercy of his Lord," he answered, "but those who go astray."
And asked them: "What matter, O angels, brings you here?"
"We have been sent," they said, "to (punish) a sinful people,
"Except the family of Lot whom we shall save
"Other than his wife who, it is decreed, will remain with those who will stay behind."
When the messengers came to the family of Lot,
He said: "You are people I do not know."
"We have come to you with news," they said, "of what your people doubt;
"Yet we bring to you the truth, and we are truthful.
"So leave with your family late in the night, yourself remaining in the rear, and let none turn back to look, and go where you will be commanded."
We issued this command to him, for they were going to be destroyed in the morning.
Then came the people of the city, exulting at the news.
Said Lot: "These are my guests; do not put me to shame,
"And do not disgrace me. Have some fear of God."
"Did we not restrain you," they said, "from (entertaining) creatures from the outside world?"
"Here are my daughters," said Lot, "if you are so active."
Verily by your life they were utterly confused in their (lustful) drunkenness.
So they were seized by the mighty blast at break of day;
And We turned the city upside down, and rained on them stones of hardened lava.
Herein are really signs for those who discern.
This (city) lies on a road that still survives.
Indeed there is a portent in this for those who believe.
The dwellers of the Wood (near Midian) were also wicked.
So We punished them too.
They are both situated by the highway, clearly visible.
The people of Al-Hijr denied Our apostles;
And though We had given them Our signs they turned away from them.
They used to hew dwellings in the mountains to live in security.
But they were seized by the mighty blast towards the morning;
And all that they had done (for security) availed them nothing.
We have not created but with reason the heavens and the earth and all that lies within them. The Hour (of the great change) is certain to come.
So turn away (from them) with a grace.
Surely your Lord is the Creator and knows (everything).
We have indeed given you the seven oft-repeated (examples), and the majestic Qur'an.
So covet not things We have bestowed on a portion of them to enjoy, and do not grieve for them, and protect those who believe;
And say: "I am a distinct warner,"
Like (those) We had sent to those schismatics who slandered their Books
And severed their Scripture into fragments.
By your Lord We shall question them one and all
About their deeds.
So declare to them what We have enjoined, and turn away from idolaters.
We are surely sufficient to deal with those who scoff at you,
Who place other gods besides God. They will come to know soon.
We are well aware that you are disheartened by what they say.
But you should glorify your Lord with praises, and be among those who bow in submission;
And go on worshipping your Lord till the certainty (of death) comes upon you.
THE DECREE of GOD will surely come; so do not try to hasten it: Too glorious and high is He for what they associate with Him.
He sends the angels with revelation by His command, to any of His creatures as He please, (saying): "Warn that there is no god but I, so fear Me."
He created the heavens and the earth with reason.
Too glorious and high is He for what they associate with Him.
Man He created from a drop of semen; and still he becomes an open contender.
He created the cattle from whom you get warm clothing and (other) advantages, and some you eat.
There is life and cheer for you as you drive them home in the evening, and lead them out in the morning to graze.
They carry your burdens to lands so distant you could not have reached without much hardship.
Indeed your Lord is compassionate and kind.
He created horses, mules and donkeys for riding and for splendour.
He created other things too which you do not know.
To God leads the right path, though some deviate.
If He willed He could guide you all to the right way.
It is He who sends down water from the sky of which you drink, and which nourishes the plants you feed your cattle,
With which He makes crops grow, and olives, dates and grapes and fruits of every kind for you. In this is a sign for those who think.
He harnessed the day and night for you, as also the sun, the moon and the stars, by His command.
In this are signs for men who understand.
And other things of different shades has He produced on the earth for you.
In this are signs for those who reflect.
It is He who has subdued the sea that you may eat fresh meat from it, and obtain ornaments to wear.
You see the ships plough through it that you may seek of His bounties and, perhaps, be grateful.
He placed stablisers in the earth so that while it revolves you live undisturbed, and rivers and tracks so that you may find your way;
As well as many other signs, as by the stars (you) find direction.
So, could one who creates be like one who cannot?
Will you not then contemplate?
If you count the favours of God you will not be able to calculate.
Assuredly God is forgiving and kind.
God knows what you hide and disclose.
, As for those they call besides God, they cannot create a thing, and have themselves been created.
Dead, without life they are, and do not know when they will be raised.
Your God is one God.
But the hearts of those who believe not in the life to come are filled with denial, and they are puffed up with pride.
Surely God knows what they hide and what they disclose.
He certainly does not love the proud.
For when they are asked: "What has your Lord sent down?" they say: "Tales of long ago."
On the Day of Resurrection they will carry their own burden and some of the load of those they have led astray without any knowledge.
Oh, how evil a burden they will carry!
Those who have gone before them had also conspired; then God uprooted their structure from its foundation; the roof fell over them from above, and punishment came upon them from somewhere they did not suspect.
On the Day of Resurrection He will disgrace them and ask: "Where are My compeers for whom you contended?"
Those endowed with knowledge will say: "Shame and evil surely are for unbelievers today."
They whose souls are drawn out by the angels while they are sinning, shall offer submission: "We did no evil."
But God knows well what you did.
So enter the gates of Hell, and dwell there for ever.
How dreadful a dwelling for the haughty!
When those who took heed for themselves would be asked: "What did your Lord send down?" They will answer: "The best."
For those who do good there is good in the world, but certainly the abode of the next is better.
How excellent the home of the virtuous!
They will enter perennial gardens with streams of water and all they wish.
Thus will the pious and devout be rewarded.
When the angels receive the souls of those who are blameless they will say: "Peace on you.
Enter Paradise as recompense for what you did."
What! Do the (unbelievers) expect that the angels should descend, or the sentence of your Lord come to pass?
So had the people done before them; yet God did not wrong them, they wronged themselves.
The evil they perpetrated overtook them, and what they mocked has turned upon them.
The idolaters say: "If God had willed we would not have worshipped anything apart from Him, nor would our fathers have done, nor would we have forbidden any thing without His (leave)."
So had the people done before them.
Therefore it is binding on the prophets to convey the message in clearest terms.
To every community We have sent an apostle. (saying:) "Worship God, and keep away from all other deities."
Thus some of them were guided by God, and ruin was justified on some.
Travel over the earth and see what befell those who accused (the apostles) of lies.
Even if you are eager to guide them, God does not surely guide those who have gone astray: They will have no one to help them.
They swear emphatically in the name of God that God will not raise the dead.
On the contrary, it is a promise incumbent on Him, though most men do not understand,
For (they fear) He might make what they differed about plain to them, and that the infidels may realise that they were liars.
Yet when We will a thing We have only to say: "Be", and it is.
Those who left their homes in the cause of God after having been oppressed, will be given by Us a better place in the world, and if they knew, the guerdon of the next would be greater
(For) those who persevere and place their trust in their Lord.
We sent before you none (as apostles) but men, to whom We sent revelations. In case you are unaware, enquire of those who are keepers of the Oracles of God.
We had Sent them with miracles and Books; and We have sent to you this Reminder so that you may explain distinctly to men what was sent down to them: They may haply reflect.
Have the plotters of mischief become unafraid that God will not split the earth to swallow them, or that punishment will not fall upon them from somewhere they do not (even) suspect?
Or that He will not seize them as they move about, and they will not be able to elude (His grasp);
Or He may seize them by diminishing their portion.
Yet your Lord is compassionate and kind.
Do they not see the shadows of all things God has created incline to the right and the left, bowing in obeisance to God?
All things that move on the earth and in the heavens, and the angels, bow in homage to God, and do not behave with pride.
They have fear of God for His power over them, and act as commanded.
God says: "Do not take to two gods, for there is only one God.
So fear Me."
Whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth belongs to Him, and His the judgement for ever.
So will you fear any other than God?
Whatsoever the blessings you enjoy are surely from God, and when in trouble you turn to Him in supplication.
Yet when He has delivered you from affliction, some of you ascribe companions to your Lord
So as to deny what We have bestowed on them.
Well, enjoy yourselves, you will come to know soon.
They set aside a portion of the food We have given them for those they do not know.
By God, you will surely have to answer for all you contrive!
They attribute daughters to God, the glorious, but for themselves whatsoever they please.
Yet when news of the birth of a daughter reaches one of them, his face is darkened, and he is overwhelmed with silent grief,
And hides from people for shame at the news, (at a loss) whether he should keep her with shame, or bury her in the ground.
How bad is the judgement that they make!
The semblance of those who believe not in the life to come is that of the meanest; but the semblance of God is the most sublime, for He is all-mighty and all-wise.
If God were to punish men for their inequity He would not leave a single moving thing on earth. Yet He gives them latitude for a time ordained.
Yet they attribute to God what they find detestable; and their tongues assert the lie that for them is only good.
On the contrary, there is Fire for them, and they will be thrown into it.
By God, We sent apostles to many a people before you, but Satan made their acts seem attractive to them, and he is their friend this day, and a painful torment awaits them.
We have sent down this Book to you that you may explain to them what it is that they are differing about, and as guidance and a grace for those who believe.
God sends down water from the skies and quickens the dead earth to a new birth.
Here is a sign for those who listen.
And surely in cattle there is a lesson for you: We give you a drink from the extract of food in their bellies and blood-purest milk so delicious to drink;
And in fruits of the date-palm and the vine, from which you obtain inebriating drinks and excellent food.
In this indeed are signs for those who understand.
Your Lord predisposed the bees to make their hives in mountains, trees and trellices,
And suck from all fruits and flit about the unrestricted paths of their Lord.
A drink of various hues comes out of their bellies which contains medicine for men.
In this is a sign for those who reflect.
It is God who creates you, then makes you die; and some reach the age of dotage when they forget what they had known before. God is indeed all-knowing and all-powerful.
God has favoured some of you over others in the means of subsistence.
But those who have been favoured with more do not give of their means to their dependents so that they may become equal with them.
Do they then deny God's beneficence?
God has provided mates for you of your own kind, and has bestowed on you sons and daughters from your mates, and has given you good things for food.
Will they even then believe in the false and deny God's grace?
Yet they worship those apart from God who cannot provide for them any sustenance from the heavens or the earth, nor will they have power to do so.
So do not invent similitudes for God.
Indeed God knows, and you do not know.
God presents the example of a man who is a hired servant with no power over anything, and another on whom We have bestowed a handsome fortune, who spends from it in private and in public: Can they be equal?
Praised be God!
But most men do not understand.
God presents another example of two men, one dumb and unable to do a thing and is a burden on his master. Wherever he is sent he returns without any good (result).
To God belong the secrets of the heavens and the earth, and the Hour of Doom is a matter of the winking of an eye, even less, for God has certainly power over all things.
God produced you from your mothers' wombs knowing nothing, but gave you ears and eyes and hearts so that you may be grateful.
Do you not see the birds held high between the heavens and the earth?
Nothing holds them (aloft) but God.
There are verily signs in this for those who believe.
God has given you homes to live in, and tents (made) from the hides of cattle convenient for days of travelling and halting; and from their wool and fur and hair you make domestic articles and goods that last a certain time.
God has given you of things created, shade, and places of shelter in the mountains, and clothes for protection against the heat, and coats (of mail) for defence during war.
He thus bestows His favours on you so that you may be grateful to Him.
If they still turn away, your duty is to warn them in clear terms.
They do know the favours of God, and yet they deny them, for most of them are not grateful.
The day We shall call a witness from every people, the unbelievers will not be allowed to make excuses.
And when the wicked shall face the torment it will not be decreased, nor will they be reprieved.
When the idolaters see their partners they will call out: "O our Lord, these are the partners we invoked instead of You;" but they will retort: "You are liars."
They will offer submission to God that Day, and the lies they fabricated will not be of the least avail.
For those who deny the truth and obstruct (others) from the way of God, We shall add torment to torment as they were perpetrating corruption.
Remind them of the Day when We shall call from every people a witness against them, and make you a witness over them, for We have revealed to you the Book as an exposition of everything, and as guidance and grace and happy tidings for those who submit.
Verily God has enjoined justice, the doing of good, and the giving of gifts to your relatives; and forbidden indecency, impropriety and oppression.
He warns you so that you may remember.
Fulfil your covenant with God, having made the covenant, and do not break your oaths once you have sworn them, as you have made God a witness over you.
Indeed God knows what you do.
And do not be like her who untwists her yarn having spun it into durable thread.
Do not use your oaths deceitfully because one party has ascendency over you.
God surely tries you in this way: He will make it clear to you on the Day of Resurrection what you were differing about.
If God had pleased He would surely have made you a single community of belief; but He leads whosoever He wills astray, and guides whosoever He please. But you will surely be questioned about what you used to do.
So do not make your oaths a means of deceiving one another, lest your foot should slip after having found its hold, and you taste of evil for having hindered (others) from the way of God, and suffer a grievous punishment.
And do not trade God's covenant for a paltry price.
Remember, what is with God is better for you, if only you knew!
For what you possess will pass, but what is with God will abide.
We shall certainly award those who persevere a recompense in keeping with their deeds.
We shall invest whosoever works for good, whether man or woman, with a pleasant life, and reward them in accordance with the best of what they have done.
So, when you recite the Qur'an seek refuge in God from Satan the execrable.
He does not have power over those who believe and place their trust in their Lord.
His power is only over those who take him as their patron, and those who ascribe equals (to God).
When We replace a message with another -- and God knows best what He reveals -- they say: "You have made it up;" yet most of them do not know.
You say: "It has been sent by divine grace from your Lord with truth to strengthen those who believe, and as guidance and good news for those who have submitted (to God)."
Yet We know what they say: "It is only a man who instructs him."
The speech of the man they imply is obscure while this is clear Arabic.
Those who do not believe in the words of God are verily not guided by God. For them is severe punishment.
They alone invent lies who do not believe in the words of God, and they are liars.
Whosoever denies having once believed -- unless he is forced to do so while his heart enjoys the peace of faith -- and opens his mind to disbelief will suffer the wrath of God. Their punishment will be great,
For they loved the life of this world more than the life to come; and God does not guide those who do not believe.
They are the ones whose hearts and ears and eyes have been sealed by God; and these are the heedless.
They will surely be losers in the life to come,
But (to) those who were victimised and left their homes and then fought and endured patiently, your Lord will surely be forgiving and kind.
On the day when every soul will come pleading for itself, and every soul will be recompensed for what it had done, no one will be wronged.
God presents the example of a town which enjoyed peace and security, its provisions coming from everywhere in abundance, but it denied the favours of God; so God acquainted it with intimate hunger and fear (as punishment) for what they had done.
An apostle came to them who was one of them, but they called him a liar. Then they were seized by torment for they were sinners.
Eat the good and lawful of things that God has given you, and be grateful for the bounty of God, if you really worship Him.
He has forbidden carrion and blood and the flesh of the swine, and what has been killed in the name of any other but God; but if one is driven by necessity (to eat it) without craving or reverting to it, then God is forgiving and kind.
Do not utter the lies your tongues make up: "This is lawful, and this is forbidden," in order to impute lies to God; for they who impute lies to God will not find fulfilment.
For them there is some enjoyment, but the punishment is painful.
We have already told you what We have forbidden the Jews.
We did not wrong them, they wronged themselves.
To those who do wrong out of ignorance, then repent and correct themselves, your Lord is indeed forgiving and kind.
Abraham was certainly a model of faith, obedient to God and upright, and not one of idolaters,
Grateful to Him for His favours; so He chose him and guided him to the path that is straight,
And gave him what is good in the world, and in the Hereafter he will be among the righteous and the good.
So We commanded you to follow the way of Abraham the upright who was not of idolaters.
As for the Sabbath, it was imposed on those who had differed about it; and your Lord will tell them on the Day of Resurrection what it was they had differed about.
Call them to the path of your Lord with wisdom and words of good advice; and reason with them in the best way possible. Your Lord surely knows who strays from His path, and He knows those who are guided the right way.
If you have to retaliate, do so to the extent you have been injured; but if you forbear it is best for those who bear with fortitude.
Endure with patience, for your endurance is not without the help of God.
Do not grieve for them, and do not be distressed by their plots.
God is verily with those who are pious and devout, and those who are doers of good.
GLORY TO HIM who took His votary to a wide and open land from the Sacred Mosque (at Makkah) to the distant Mosque whose precincts We have blessed, that We may show him some of Our signs.
Verily He is all-hearing and all-seeing.
We gave Moses the Book, and made it a guidance for the children of Israel that they should not take another protector apart from Me.
O you, the offspring of those We bore (in the ark) with Noah, he was indeed a grateful votary.
We announced to the children of Israel in the Book: "You will surely create disorder twice in the land, and become exceedingly arrogant."
So, when the time of the first prediction came, We sent against you Our creatures full of martial might, who ransacked your cities; and the prediction was fulfilled.
Then We gave you a chance against them, and strengthened you with wealth and children, and increased your numbers (and said):
"If you do good, you will do so for your own good; if you do ill, you will do it for your own loss."
So, when the time of the second prediction comes, (We shall rouse another people) to shame you, and enter the Temple as they had done the first time, and to destroy what they conquered utterly.
But if you repeat it, We shall do the same. We have constituted Hell as prison for unbelievers.
Verily this Qur'an directs you to the path that is straight, and gives happy tidings to those who believe and do the right: For them is a great reward.
As for those who do not believe in the Hereafter, We have prepared a painful punishment.
Man prays for evil as he prays for good, for man is hasty.
We have created night and day as two signs, then We efface the sign of the night, and make the sign of the day resplendent that you may seek the bounty of your Lord, and know the computation of years and numbers.
We have expounded most distinctly everything.
Round each man's neck We have hung his ledger of deeds, and on the Day of Resurrection will present it as a book spread out (and say):
"Read your ledger; this day you are sufficient to take your own account.
"He who finds the right path does so for himself; and he who goes astray does so to his own loss; and no one who carries a burden bears another's load.
We never punish till We have sent a messenger.
"And when We destroy a human habitation We send Our command to (warn) its people living a life of ease; and when they disobey, the sentence against them is justified, and We destroy them utterly.
"How many generations have We laid low after Noah, for your Lord knows and notices well enough the sins of His creatures.
"Whosoever desires what hastes away, We hasten to give him (in this life) as much as We please to whosoever We will; but afterwards there is Hell for him in which he will burn, disgraced and ostracised.
"But he who desires the Hereafter, and strives for it with a will, and is a believer, will be favoured for his endeavour.
"We bestow from the gifts of your Lord on these and on those, for the gifts of your Lord are not restricted.
"See, how We favour one over the other; and in life to come are higher ranks and favours greater still.
"Do not set up another god with God, or you will remain disgraced and destitute.
"So your Lord has decreed: Do not worship anyone but Him, and be good to your parents.
If one or both of them grow old in your presence, do not say fie to them, nor reprove them, but say gentle words to them
"And look after them with kindness and love, and say: "O Lord, have mercy on them as they nourished me when I was small."
Your Lord knows what is in your heart. If you are righteous, then He is indeed forgiving to those who turn (to Him) in repentance.
So give to your relatives what is their due, and to those who are needy, and the wayfarers; and do not dissipate (your wealth) extravagantly.
Those who dissipate (their wealth) are the brethren of the devils, and the Devil was ungrateful to his Lord.
If you neglect (your parents) while seeking the bounty of your Lord, of which you are hopeful, speak to them softly.
Do not be niggardly, nor extravagant that you may later feel reprehensive and constrained.
Certainly your Lord provides with open hands whosoever He will, but according to capacity, for He knows and watches His creatures.
Do not abandon your children out of fear of poverty. We will provide for them and for you.
Killing them is certainly a great wrong.
And do not go near fornication, as it is immoral and an evil way.
And do not take a life, which God has forbidden, except in a just cause.
We have given the right (of redress) to the heir of the person who is killed, but he should not exceed the limits (of justice) by slaying (the killer), for he will be judged (by the same law).
And do not touch the property of the orphans except for bettering it, until they come of age; and fulfil the promise made: You will surely be questioned about the promise.
Give full measure when you are measuring, and weigh on a balanced scale. This is better, and excellent its consequence.
Do not follow that of which you have no knowledge.
Verily the ear, the eye, the heart, each will be questioned.
And do not strut about the land with insolence: Surely you cannot cleave the earth, nor attain the height of mountains in stature.
All these are evil and odious to your Lord.
This is some of the wisdom your Lord has revealed to you.
So do not take another god apart from God, or you will be cast into Hell, reproved, ostracised.
Has God chosen to give you sons, and taken for Himself daughters from among the angels?
You utter grievous things indeed!
We have explained (the truth) in various ways in this Qur'an, that they may be warned; but it only increased their refractoriness.
Say: "Had there been other gods with Him, as they assert, they would surely have sought a way (of opposition) against the Lord of the Throne."
Too glorious and high is He, too exalted for what they say!
The seven skies, the earth, and all that lies within them, sing hallelujas to Him. There is nothing that does not chant His praises, but you do not understand their hymns of praise.
He is verily clement and forgiving.
When you recite the Qur'an, We place a hidden veil between you and those who do not believe in the Hereafter;
And We put covers over their hearts and deafness in their ears that they should not understand it.
So when you invoke your Lord alone in the Qur'an they turn their backs and walk away.
We know well with what (intent) they hear you, for when they confer privately the wicked say: "You follow but a man deluded."
See, what comparisons they coin for you, and go astray, and thus cannot find the way.
Yet they say: "When we are turned to bones and bits, shall we be raised as a new creation?"
Tell them: "(Even if) you turn to stones or steel,
Or some other created thing which may seem to you most difficult (to create)!"
They will then say: "Who will revert us back?"
Say: "He who originated you in the first place."
They will shake their heads at you and say: "When will that be?"
Say: "In the near future, perhaps,
"On the day when He will call you, and you will answer with His praises and imagine you did not tarry but a while."
Tell My creatures only to speak words that are good.
Verily Satan sows dissensions: Satan is indeed the acknowledged enemy of mankind.
Your Lord knows you better: He may have mercy on you if He please, or punish you if He will.
Yet We have not sent you as warden over them.
Your Lord knows whoever is in the heavens and the earth.
We exalted some of the prophets over the others; and to David We gave the Book of Psalms.
Say: "Call those whom you imagine to be gods besides Him; yet they have no power to relieve you of any distress or to avert it."
Those they invoke themselves seek the way to their Lord, (striving) which one of them shall be nearest (to Him); and hope for His grace, and dread His punishment.
Indeed, the punishment of your Lord is to be feared!
There is not a habitation We shall not destroy before the Day of Resurrection, or not inflict severe punishment upon it.
This is in accordance with the law (of God).
Nothing could stop Us from sending signs except that the earlier people had rejected them as lies.
We sent to Thamud the she-camel as a token to make it clear to them, but they treated her cruelly; and We send signs only to deter.
When We said to you: "Verily your Lord circumscribes mankind," and showed you the vision and the accursed tree of the Qur'an, it was as a bone of contention for men.
Thus do We (instil) fear in them; but they only transgress the more.
When We asked the angels to bow before Adam, they all bowed but Iblis, who said: "Can I bow before him whom You created from clay?"
(And) said: "Look!
This is what you have honoured above me!
If You defer (my term) till the Day of Resurrection, I will bring his progeny into complete subjugation, barring a few."
(And God) said: "Away!
Whosoever of them follows you will surely have Hell with you as requital -- an ample recompense.
Mislead any of them you may with your voice, attack them with your cavalry and soldiers on foot, share their wealth and children with them, and make promises to them." -- But the promises of Satan are nothing but deceit.
"You will surely have no power over My devotees: Your Lord is sufficient as their protector."
It is your Lord who drives your ships across the seas that you may seek of His bounty.
He is verily kind to you.
When a calamity befalls you on the sea, all those you invoke fail you except Him.
But when He brings you safely to the shore, you turn away, for man is most ungrateful.
Have you then become so sure that He will not cleave the earth and sink you in it by the shore, or send a gale against you, when you will not find any protector.
Or you feel so secure that He will not send you back (to sea) again or send a gravel-hurtling storm against you, and drown you for your ingratitude?
Then you will not find any avenger against Us.
Indeed We have honoured the children of Adam, and carried them over land and sea, provided them with good things for their sustenance, and exalted them over many of Our creatures.
The day We shall summon all men with their leaders, whosoever is given his record in his right hand will be able to read his account, and none will be wronged the breadth of a thread.
But whoso has been blind in this world shall be blind in the world to come, even farther astray from the path.
They had almost led you away from what has been revealed to you, that you may invent things about Us besides those revealed, when they would have taken you as friend.
If We had not kept you constant you had almost leaned towards them.
In that case We would have made you taste a double anguish of life and a double anguish of death, and then you would not have been able to find a helper against Us for yourself.
They had nearly expelled you from the land and driven you away from it. But then, they too would have stayed but a little after you.
This has been Our way with the apostles whom We sent before you. You will not find any variation in Our line of action.
Observe the service of prayer from the sun's declining from the meridian to the darkening of the night, and the recitation at dawn.
Indeed the Recitation at dawn is palpably evident.
Say a supererogatory prayer at the hour of the first watch: Your Lord may raise you to a most exalted station.
And pray: "O my Lord, let my entry be with honour, and let my exit be with honour, and grant me power from You which would help (sustain) me."
And say: "Truth has come and falsehood nullified." Verily falsehood is perishable.
What We have sent down of the Qur'an is a healing and a grace for the faithful, and adds only loss for the sinners.
When We are gracious to man he turns away and moves aside; yet when evil befalls him he begins to despair.
Say: "Each one acts according to his disposition, but your Lord knows well who follow the right path."
They ask you about revelation.
Say, revelation is by the command of your Lord, and that you have been given but little knowledge.
If We pleased We could take away what We have revealed to you. Then you will not find any one to plead for it with Us,
Unless your Lord have mercy.
His blessings on you are great indeed.
Say: "Surely if men and jinns get together to produce the like of this (Qur'an), they will not be able to produce the like of it, however they might assist one another.
We have given examples of every kind to men in this Qur'an in various ways, and even then most men disdain everything but unbelief,
And say: "We will not believe you until you make a spring of water gush forth from the earth for us;
Or, until you acquire an orchard of date-palm trees and grapes, and produce rivers flowing through it;
Or, let chunks of sky fall over us, as you assert (you will); or, bring God and the angels as a surety;
Or, you come to possess a house of gold; or ascend to the skies, though we shall not believe in your having ascended till you bring down a book for us which we could read."
Say: "Glory to my Lord.
I am only man and a messenger."
Nothing prevented men from believing when guidance came to them, other than (what) they said: "Has God sent (only) a man as messenger?"
Say: "If angels had peopled the earth and walked about in peace and quiet, We would surely have sent to them an angel as messenger.
Tell them: "God is sufficient witness between me and you, for He knows His creatures well, and is well-informed."
He is guided whom God guides. As for him He allows to go astray, you will not find a protector other than Him.
We shall raise them on the Day of Resurrection in their own image, blind and dumb and deaf: Their habitation will be Hell.
Every time (its fire) subsides We will intensify its flame.
This will be their retribution for having denied Our signs and said: "Once we are turned to bones and bits, can we be raised as a new creation?"
Do they not perceive that God, who created the heavens and the earth, has the power to create the like of them?
There is no doubt that. He has fixed a term for them.
Even then the wicked disdain everything but unbelief.
Say: "Even if you owned the stores of the mercy of my Lord, you would have held them back for fear of spending them, for man is niggardly."
We gave Moses nine clear signs; so ask the children of Israel.
When (Moses) came to them the Pharaoh said: "I think, O Moses, you have been deluded."
He replied: "You know that none but the Lord of the heavens and the earth has sent these (signs) as cogent proof. I truly think, O Pharaoh, your days are done."
Then he sought to turn them out of the land, but We drowned him and all his followers.
After this We told the children of Israel: "Dwell in the land. When the promise of reckoning comes, We shall bring you together from a motley crowd.
We have sent it down with truth, and with truth has (the Qur'an) come down.
And We have sent you only to give good news and to warn.
We have divided the Qur'an into parts that you may recite it to men slowly, with deliberation. That is why We sent it down by degrees.
Say: "Believe in it or do not believe: Those who were given knowledge before it bow in adoration when it is read out to them,
And say: "Glory be to our Lord.
The promise of our Lord has indeed been fulfilled."
And weeping they kneel down, and this increases their humility.
Say: "Call Him Allah or call Him Ar-Rahman; whatever the name you call Him by, all His names are beautiful."
Do not say your prayers too loudly or in too low a voice, but follow a middle coarse.
And say: "All praise be to God who has neither begotten a son nor has a partner in His kingdom; nor has He need of any one to protect Him from ignominy.
So extol Him by extolling His majesty."
ALL PRAISE BE to God who has revealed to His votary the Book which is free of all obliquity,
Immutable, so that it may warn of a severe punishment from Him; and give happy tidings to those who believe and do the right that there is a better reward (of Paradise) for them,
Where they will abide for ever;
And that it may warn those who say: "God has begotten a son."
They have no knowledge of this, as their fathers did not have.
How terrible are the words they utter!
They speak nothing but lies.
Will you kill yourself for grief of them if they do not believe in this presentation?
We have made whatever exists on the earth its adornment to test and try them (and) know who acts better;
For We shall certainly turn it to barren dust.
Do you think the men of the cave and Ar-Raqim were so strange among Our signs?
When those young men took shelter in the cave, and prayed: "O Lord, grant us Your favour and dispose our affair aright,"
We sealed off their ears in the cave for a number of years,
Then roused them to ascertain which of the two groups could account for the period they had stayed.
We narrate their story to you in all truth. They were a few young men who believed in their Lord; so We gave them greater guidance.
And strengthened their hearts when they stood up and said: "Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth.
We shall invoke no god beside Him, for we shall have uttered a blasphemy then.
As for these our people here, they have taken to other gods apart from Him.
Then why do they not bring a clear authority for them?
Who is more wicked than he who fabricates a lie against God?"
(And they said to each other:) "Now that you have withdrawn from them and what they worship beside God, it is better to take refuge in the cave. Your Lord may bestow of His mercy on you, and facilitate your affair."
You may well have seen when the sun came up it moved away to the right of the cave, and when it went down it turned away to the left, and they stayed in its open space.
This was among the signs of God.
Whoever is guided by God follows the right path; and whosoever goes astray will not find a guide to show him the way.
You may have thought that they were awake, yet they were asleep. We made them turn right and left, while their dog lay with his forelegs stretched across the threshold.
If you had looked at them you would have surely turned away and fled with horror at the sight.
Even so We roused them that they may question one another.
One of them asked: "How long have you stayed here?"
They said: "A day or less than a day."
"Your Lord knows best," they said, "how long you have stayed.
So send one of you to the town with this money of yours to look for wholesome food and bring it for you; but he should be careful not to let your presence known.
If they come to know of you they will stone you to death, or force you to go back to their creed; then you will never succeed."
Thus did We inform the people about them that they may know the promise of God is true, and there is no doubt that the Hour will come.
As they were arguing among themselves as to what should be done with them, (some) said: "Erect a monument over them.
Their Lord is best cognisant of them."
Those who prevailed, said: "We shall build a place of worship over their (sepulchre)."
Some will say: "They were three, and their dog was the fourth;" and some will also say: "They were five and their dog was the sixth," -- guessing in the dark. And some will even say: "They were seven, and their dog the eighth."
Say: "My Lord alone knows best their number; none but only a few know of them."
So do not argue about it with them but lightly, and do not enquire about them from any one of them.
Do not say of any thing: "I will do it tomorrow,"
Without (adding), "if God may please;" and think of your Lord in ease you forget, and say: "Perhaps my Lord will show me a nearer way to rectitude."
(It is said) they stayed in the cave three hundred years and nine.
You say: "God only knows how long they stayed.
He alone knows the secrets of the heavens and the earth.
How distinctly He sees and hears!
They have no other guardian but Him, and He does not share His authority with any one."
Recite what has been revealed to you of the Book of your Lord.
There is no one who can change the word of God; and you will not find refuge except in Him.
Persevere with those who call on their Lord morning and evening, seeking His magnificence. Do not turn your eyes away from them, seeking the splendours of this world, and do not follow him whose heart We have made oblivious to Our remembrance, who follows his own lust and exceeds the bound.
Say: "The truth is from your Lord: So believe if you like, or do not believe if you will."
We have prepared for the sinners a fire which will envelope them in its tent.
If they ask for water they will be helped to liquid like molten brass that would scald their mouths.
How evil the drink, and evil the resting-place!
But surely We do not let the reward of those who believe and do the right to go waste.
There will be gardens of Eden for them, with rivers flowing by, where they will be decked in bracelets of gold, with silken robes of green and of brocades to wear, reclining on couches.
How excellent the guerdon, and excellent the resting-place!
Tell them the parable of two men. We gave one two gardens of grapes surrounded by date-palm trees, with corn fields in between.
Each of the gardens yielded its fruit and did not withhold the least; and We made a stream flow in between them.
So he became rich.
Arguing one day with his friend he said: "I have more wealth than you and more powerful kinsmen."
And he walked into his garden, and, (forgetting) his limit, said: "I cannot imagine that this will ever be ruined,
Nor can I think that the Hour (of Doom) will come, And even if I am brought back to my Lord, I will surely find a better place there than this."
Disputing with him, his companion said: "Do you disbelieve in Him who created you from dust, then a drop of semen, then formed you into a man?
And He is God, my Lord, and I do not associate any one with my Lord.
When you entered your garden, why did you not say: 'As God may please;' for no one has power except given by God? Though you see me poorer in wealth and children than you,
Yet, my Lord may haply give me a garden better than yours, and He may send a thunder-bolt, from the skies and in the morning it will be a barren plain;
Or else of a morning its water may sink underground, and you will not find a trace of it."
And his vines were overtaken (with disaster), and he began to wring his hands (at the loss) of what he had spent on them, for the vines had fallen upon their trellises; and he said: "Would to God that I had not associated any one with my Lord."
He had no body to help him other than God, nor was he able to save himself.
The jurisdiction in this province belongs to God.
His is the best reward, and His the best requital.
Present to them the example of the life of this world so like the water We send down from the skies that mingles with the earth to nourish its vegetation, which then on the morrow turns to stubble and is blown away by the wind.
God has power over everything.
Wealth and children are only the gloss of this world, but good deeds that abide are better with your Lord for recompense, and better for expectation.
The day We shall move the mountains, and you see the earth an open plain, We shall gather them together, leaving none behind.
They will be arraigned before their Lord row on row, (and He will say): "Well, you have come to Us as We had first created you, even though you imagined We had fixed no time for this meeting."
The ledger (of their deeds) would be placed before them. Then you will see the sinners terrified at its contents, and say: "Alas, what a written revelation this, which has not left unaccounted the smallest or the greatest thing!"
They will find in it whatsoever they had done.
Your Lord does not wrong any one.
When We said to the angels: "Bow before Adam in adoration," they all bowed but Iblis.
He was one of the jinni and rebelled against his Lord's command.
And yet you take him and his offspring as your friends instead of Me, even though they are your enemies.
How sad a substitute for the evil-doers!
I did not call them to witness the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor their own creation. I would not take as helpers those who lead (men) astray.
The day He will say: "Call those you had called My compeers," they will call them, but will get no response, and We shall place a gulf between them.
The sinners will see the Fire and know that they will be thrown into it and will not find a way of escape from it.
We have explained in various ways all things to men in this Qur'an; but of all things man is most contentious.
There is nothing to prevent men from believing when the guidance has come to them, and asking for their Lord's forgiveness, unless they want the example of earlier people visited upon them, or the punishment to appear right before their eyes.
We never send apostles but to convey happy tidings, and to warn.
But those who disbelieve contend with false arguments to nullify the truth.
They make a mockery of My revelations and of what they had been warned.
Who is more unjust than he who, on being reminded of his Lord's revelations, turns away from them, and forgets the evil deeds he had committed in the past.
Verily We have placed a covering on their hearts so that they do not understand, and a deafness in their ears so that however you may call them to guidance they will never be guided aright.
But your Lord is forgiving, full of benevolence.
If He had pleased to punish them for their doings He would have punished them immediately.
But a term is fixed for them from which they will find no escape.
As for these habitations, We destroyed them only when they transgressed; even so We had fixed a time for their annihilation.
When Moses said to his servant (Joshua): "I will not give up till I reach the confluence of two oceans, or I will journey on and on."
When they reached the confluence they forgot the fish (they had brought as food) which swiftly made its way into the sea.
When they had gone past (the confluence), Moses said to his servant: "Give me my breakfast.
I am exhausted from this journey."
He said: "You see, I forgot the fish on the rock where we had stopped. Only Satan made me forget to mention this; but the wonder is the fish escaped to the sea."
Moses said: "But that is exactly what we were seeking."
So they retraced their steps.
Then they found one of Our votaries, whom We had blessed and given knowledge from Us.
Moses said to him: "May I attend upon you that you may instruct me in the knowledge you have been taught of the right way?"
He said: "You will not be able to bear with me.
"How can you bear that which is beyond your comprehension?"
"You will find me patient if God wills," said Moses; "and I will not disobey you in any thing."
"If you must follow me," he said, "do not ask me any thing until I speak of it to you myself."
So they set out till they (came to the quay) and went on board a ship in which he made a hole, (and Moses said:) "You have made a hole in the boat to drown its passengers?
You have done a strange thing!"
"Did I not tell you," he replied, "that you will not be able to bear with me?"
(Moses) said: "Do not hold me for having forgotten, and do not reprove me and make my task difficult."
The two went on till they came to a boy, whom he killed.
Moses exclaimed: "You have killed an innocent soul who had taken no life.
You have done a most abominable thing!"
He said: "Did I not tell you you will not be able to bear with me?"
Moses said: "If I ask you any thing again then do not keep me with you. You have my apology."
The two went on till they came upon some villagers, and asked the people for food, but they refused to entertain them.
There they found a wall that was crumbling, which he repaired.
Moses remarked: "You could have demanded wages for it if you liked."
"This is the parting of our "ways," he said.
"But I will now explain the things you could not bear:
That boat belonged to poor people who used to toil on the sea. I damaged it because there was a king after them who used to seize every ship by force.
As for the boy, his parents were believers, but we feared that he would harass them with defiance and disbelief.
We hoped their Lord would give them a substitute better than him in virtue and goodness.
Their father was an upright man. So your Lord willed that on reaching the age of maturity they should dig out their treasure as a favour from their Lord.
So, I did not do that of my own accord. This is the explanation of things you could not bear with patience."
They ask you about Dhu'l-Qarnain.
Say: "I will cite before you his commemoration." We gave him authority in the land and means of accomplishing every end.
So he followed a certain road
Till he reached the point of the setting sun, and saw it set behind a muddy lake, and near it found a people.
We said: "O Dhu'l-Qarnain, you may either punish them or treat them with kindness."
He said: "I shall punish whosoever is wicked. He will then be sent back to his Lord who will inflict on him a terrible punishment.
But he who believes and does the right will have an excellent reward, and we shall make things easy for him."
He then followed (another) road
Till he reached the point of the rising sun, and saw it rise over a people for whom We had provided no shelter against it.
It was so, for We were fully informed about him.
He then followed (another) road
Till he reached a place between two mountains, and found this side of it a people who understood but little of what was spoken.
They said: 'O Dhu'l-Qarnain, Gog and Magog are oppressing the land. May we pay you some tribute so that you could build a rampart between us and them?"
He said: "The ability my Lord has given me is better.
So help me with your manual labour; I will build a wall between you and them.
Bring me ingots of iron," (which they did) until the space between two mountain sides was filled up.
"Blow your bellows," he said; (and they blew) until it was red hot. "Bring me molten brass," he said, "that I may pour over it."
Thus (Gog and Magog) could neither climb over it nor dig a hole through (the rampart).
"This is the benevolence of my Lord," he said; "but when the promise of my Lord comes to pass, He will reduce it to a mound of dust; and the promise of my Lord is true."
We shall leave them on that day surging like waves pressing one against the other, and the trumpet blast will be sounded, when We shall gather them all together.
Then We shall bring Hell right before the infidels
Whose eyes were veiled against My warning, and they could not hear.
Do the unbelievers think they can make My own creatures their protectors against Me?
We have prepared Hell for the hospitality of infidels.
Say: "Shall I tell you whose labour will be wasted?
Theirs whose effort is misspent in pursuit of the pleasures of the world, even though they think they are doing good things."
They are those who reject the signs of their Lord, and the meeting with Him.
So their good deeds will be fruitless, and on the Day of Judgement We shall not appoint any weighing for them.
Their requital will be Hell, because they disbelieved and mocked My signs and messengers.
But surely those who believe and do the right will have gardens of Paradise as gift,
Where they will abide for ever, never wanting a change.
Say: "If the ocean turned to ink for writing down the colloquy of my Lord, the ocean itself would be exhausted ere the words (and wonders) of my Lord come to end, even if we brought another like it for replenishment."
Say: "I am only a man like you, but it has been communicated to me that your Lord is one and single God, and that whosoever hopes to meet his Lord should do what is right, and not associate any one in the worship of his Lord."
KAF HA YA 'AIN SAD.
Commemorate the beneficence of your Lord on Zachariah, His devotee,
When he called to his Lord inwardly,
And said: "O my Lord, my bones decay, my head is white and hoary, yet in calling You, O Lord, I have never been deprived.
But I fear my relatives after me; and my wife is barren.
So grant me a successor as a favour from You
Who will be heir to me, and heir to the house of Jacob; and make him obedient to You, O Lord."
"O Zachariah," (it was) said, "We give you good news of a son by name of John.'
To none have We attributed the name before."
"How can I have a son, O Lord" he said, "when my wife is barren and I am old and decrepit?"
(The angel) answered: "Thus will it be. Your Lord said: 'This is easy for Me; for when I brought you into being you were nothing.'
He said: "O Lord, give me a token."
"Though sound," He answered, "you will not talk to any one for three nights running."
So he came from the chamber to his people, and suggested to them (by signs) to sing the praises of the Lord morning and evening.
(We said:) "O John, hold fast to the Book;" and We gave him wisdom right from boyhood,
And compassion from Us, and goodness.
So he was devout,
And kind to his parents, neither arrogant nor disobedient.
So peace on him the day he was born, the day he will die, and the day that he will be raised from the dead.
Commemorate Mary in the Book.
When she withdrew from her family to a place in the East
And took cover from them, We sent a spirit of Ours to her who appeared before her in the concrete form of a man.
"I seek refuge in the Merciful from you, if you fear Him," she said.
He replied: "I am only a messenger from your Lord (sent) to bestow a good son on you."
"How can I have a son," she said, "when no man has touched me, nor am I sinful?"
Your Lord said: 'It is easy for Me,' and that: 'We shall make him a sign for men and a blessing from Us.' This is a thing already decreed."
When she conceived him she went away to a distant place.
The birth pangs led her to the trunk of a date-palm tree.
"Would that I had died before this," she said, "and become a thing forgotten, unremembered."
Then (a voice) called to her from below: "Grieve not; your Lord has made a rivulet gush forth right below you.
Shake the trunk of the date-palm tree, and it will drop ripe dates for you.
Eat and drink, and be at peace.
If you see any man, tell him: 'I have verily vowed a fast to Ar-Rahman and cannot speak to any one this day.'
Then she brought the child to her people.
They exclaimed: "O Mary, you have done a most astonishing thing!
O sister of Aaron, your father was not a wicked person, nor your mother sinful!"
But she pointed towards him.
"How can we talk to one," they said, "who is only an infant in the cradle?"
"I am a servant of God," he answered. "He has given me a Book and made me a prophet,
And blessed me wherever I may be, and enjoined on me worship and zakat for as long as I live,
And be dutiful to my mother. He has not made me haughty or rebellious.
There was peace on me the day I was born, and will be the day I die, and on the day I will be raised from the dead."
This was Jesus, son of Mary: A true account they contend about.
It does not behove God to have a son.
Too immaculate is He!
When He decrees a thing He has only to say: "Be", and it is.
(Jesus only said:) "Surely God is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him.
This is the straight path."
Yet the sectarians differed among themselves. Alas for the unbelievers when they see the Terrible Day!
How keenly would they hear and see when they come before Us then, even though today the evil-doers are lost in palpable error.
Warn them of that day of pining when all matters will have been settled, though they would still be unaware and unbelieving (of the truth).
Verily We shall inherit the earth and whosoever is on it, and to Us they will return.
Commemorate Abraham in the Book: He was upright, a prophet.
Remember, when he said to his father: "O my father, why do you worship that which can neither hear nor see nor even profit you the least?
O my father, to me has come such knowledge as never came to you. So follow me that I may show you the right path.
Why do you worship Satan, O father? Verily Satan was disobedient to Ar-Rahman.
O my father, I fear lest a punishment from Ar-Rahman should befall you, and you should become a friend of the Devil."
He said: "Are you averse to my gods, O Abraham?
If you do not desist, I shall have you stoned to death.
So go away for a while from me."
He answered: "Peace be on you.
I will seek forgiveness of my Lord for you. He has been gracious to me.
I will leave you and those you invoke apart from God, and pray to my Lord. Haply in praying to my Lord I will not be deprived."
Thus, when he left them and the (idols) they worshipped, We bestowed on him Isaac and Jacob, and made each of them a prophet,
And bestowed on them some of Our blessings, and gave them high renown.
Commemorate Moses in the Book.
He was a chosen one, both an apostle and a prophet.
We called him from the right side of the Mount, and brought him close for communion;
And bestowed on him his brother Aaron, a prophet, through Our benevolence.
Commemorate Ishmael in the Book.
He was true of his promise, and a messenger, a prophet.
He enjoined on his household worship and zakat, and he was obedient to his Lord.
Commemorate Enoch in the Book.
He was a truthful person and a prophet,
And We raised him to an exalted station.
These are (some of) those who were favoured by God among the prophets of the progeny of Adam, and of those We bore in the ark with Noah, and the offspring of Abraham and Israel, and of those We guided and We chose, for they bowed weeping in adoration when the revelations of Ar-Rahman were recited to them.
But they are succeeded by a generation who neglect their devotional obligations and follow only earthly pleasures; but they will reach the wrong road and meet destruction,
Except those who repent and come to believe and do the right.
These will enter Paradise and will not be wronged the least
In the gardens of Eden promised by Ar-Rahman to His creatures in the unknown (future).
Verily His promise will come to pass.
They will hear no vain talk there, but only salutations of peace, and they will have their sustenance morning and evening."
This is the Paradise those of Our creatures will inherit who take heed and fear the displeasure of God.
"We do not come down," (will the angels say) "but only by your Lord's command."
To Him belongs whatever lies before us and behind us, and the space in between. Your Lord does not ever forget:
Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them.
Therefore worship Him, and be constant in His worship.
Do you know any namesake of His?
Yet man says: "When I am dead, will I come to life again?"
Does man not remember that before We created him he was nothing?
By your Lord, We shall gather them and the devils together, then bring them crawling on their knees around Hell.
We shall pull out of every section those who were most perversely rebellious against Ar-Rahman.
We know best who deserve to be burnt in (the Fire).
There is not one among you who will not reach it. Your Lord has made this incumbent on Himself.
We shall deliver those who took heed for themselves, and leave the evil-doers kneeling there.
When Our lucid revelations are read out to them, the infidels say to those who believe: "Which of the two groups is better in standing, and whose company is more excellent?"
How many generations that had far more wealth and ostentation have We laid low before them!
Say: "Ar-Rahman extends the life of those who are astray until they come to realise what had been promised them was either (physical) affliction or (the terror) of Resurrection. Then will they know who is worse in position, and who is weak in supporters.
God gives greater guidance to those who are guided; and good deeds that endure are better with your Lord for reward, and better for consequence.
Have you seen him who denies Our revelations, and says: "I will certainly be given wealth and children."
Has he peeped into the Unknown, or obtained a promise from Ar-Rahman?
Never so. We shall certainly write down what he says, and prolong the extent of his punishment.
All that he claims will revert to Us, and he will come before Us all alone.
They have taken other gods apart from God that they might be a strength to them.
Never. They will deny their devotion and become their adversaries.
Do you not see that We have set the devils against the infidels to rouse and instigate them?
So, do not be hasty with them. We are counting their number (of days).
The day We shall usher the righteous before Ar-Rahman like envoys into the presence of a king,
And drive the wicked into Hell like cattle driven to water,
None will have power to intercede for them except one who obtains a promise from Ar-Rahman.
They say: "God has begotten a son."
You have uttered a grievous thing
Which would cleave the skies asunder, rend the earth, and split the mountains,
For they have attributed a son to Ar-Rahman,
When it does not behove the Merciful to have a son.
There is no one in the heavens and the earth but comes before Ar-Rahman in all obedience.
He has counted them and calculated their number.
Every one of them will come before Him all alone on the Day of Resurrection.
Surely Ar-Rahman will show love for those who believe and do the right.
So We have made this (Qur'an) easy in your tongue that you may give good news to those who take heed, and warn the people who are contentious.
How many generations have We laid low before them.
Do you see any sign of them, or hear the least whisper of them?
TA HA.
We have not sent down the Qur'an to you that you should be burdened,
But as admonition for him who fears --
A revelation from Him who created the earth and the high ascending skies,
The ever-merciful, established on the throne (of authority).
Whatever is in the heavens and the earth and in between them, belongs to Him, as whatever lies under the earth.
Whether you say a thing aloud or inaudibly, He has knowledge of the secret and the hidden.
God: There is no god but He.
To Him belong the attributes most beautiful.
Has the story of Moses come to you?
I have seen a fire. I may haply be able to bring an ember from it, or find direction by the fire."
When he approached it, a voice called out:
"O Moses, I am verily your Lord, so take off your shoes, for you are in the holy plain of Towa.
I have chosen you, so listen to what is revealed to you.
I am God, and there is no god but I, so serve Me, and observe acts of prayer to remember Me.
Verily the Hour (of the great change) is about to come.
I keep it secret that every soul may be rewarded for its endeavour.
So do not let those who do not believe in it and follow their vain desires, turn you away from it.
What is that in your right band, O Moses?"
"It's my staff," he answered; "I lean on it, and fell leaves for my goats with it, and I have other uses for it."
"Throw it down, O Moses," said (the Voice).
So he threw it down, and lo, it became a running serpent.
"Catch it," said He, "and have no fear; We shall revert it to its former state.
And face what is to come with patience, your hand will not be tarnished with blame: Another sign
That We may go on showing you Our greater signs.
Go to the Pharaoh as he has become exceedingly rebellious."
Moses said: "O my Lord, enlarge my breast,
And make my mission easy.
Remove the defect of my tongue
That they may understand my speech,
And give me as assistant from my family
Aaron my brother
To strengthen me
And share my task,
That we may sing Your praises much,
And remember you a great deal.
Surely You know us well."
He answered: "Granted is your prayer, O Moses.
We have bestowed Our favour on you before this
When We told your mother what We relate:
'Put him in a wooden box and cast it in the river. The river will cast it on the bank.
An enemy of Ours, and his, will retrieve it.' We bestowed Our love on you that you may be reared under Our eyes.
Then your sister followed you, and said (to the people who had retrieved the child): 'Should I guide you to a person who can nurse him?'
We thus brought you back to your mother that her heart may be cheered, and she may not grieve.
(Remember) when you killed a man We saved you from anguish; and tested and steeled you (in other ways).
Afterwards you sojourned for several years with the people of Midian; then you came up to the measure,
And I chose you for Myself.
Go with My signs, you and your brother, and do not be lax in remembering Me.
Then go to the Pharaoh as he has become exceedingly rebellious.
Speak to him gently. He may possibly take heed or may come to have fear."
They said: "O our Lord, we are really frightened lest he behave insolently with us or become violent."
(The Lord) said: "Be not afraid.
I am verily with you, and I hear and see.
So go to him and say: 'The two of us have indeed been sent by your Lord. So let the children of Israel come with us, and do not oppress them.
We have come to you with a token from your Lord. Peace on him who follows the way of guidance.
It has been revealed to us that punishment will befall him who denies and turns away.
He asked: "Who then is that Lord of yours, O Moses?"
(Moses) said: "Our Lord is He who gave everything its natural form and directed it."
(The Pharaoh) said: "And what about the former generations?"
(Moses) replied: "Knowledge of that is with my Lord (recorded) in the Book.
My Lord neither errs nor forgets."
It is He who made the earth a bed for you, and traced for you paths upon it, and sends down water from the sky, and brings out through it every kind of vegetation
To eat and feed your cattle.
Surely there are signs in these for those who are wise.
We created you from the earth and will revert you back to it; and raise you up from it a second time.
So We showed him all Our signs, but he denied them and refused,
And said: "Have you come to us, O Moses, to drive us out of our land with your witchery?
We shall certainly meet you with like magic. So make an appointment when we and you could meet on common ground, which neither we nor you should fail to keep."
Said (Moses): "Let your meeting be on the day of the Feast, and let people assemble in broad daylight."
After this the Pharaoh withdrew and settled his stratagem, then came back.
Moses said to them: "Woe betide you. Do not fabricate a lie against God, or He will destroy you with some affliction.
For he who fabricates lies is doomed to failure."
So they discussed their strategy among themselves and conferred privately,
(And) said: "These two are surely magicians. They want to deprive you of your land with their magic, and eradicate your distinct way (of life).
So prepare your strategy and come forward.
He alone shall win today who is superior."
They said: "Either you cast (your spell), O Moses, or we shall cast it first."
Moses said: "No.
You cast it first" Then it seemed to Moses that by their magic their cords and rods were flying;
And Moses felt afraid within himself.
We said to him: "Fear not. You will certainly be victorious.
Throw down what is in your right hand: It will swallow up what they have conjured. For what they have fashioned is only a trick of the sorcerer; and a sorcerer does not succeed wherever he may come."
The magicians, (seeing the miracle), fell down in prostration, saying: "We believe in the Lord of Moses and Aaron."
(The Pharaoh) said: "You have come to believe without my dispensation.
Surely he is your chief who taught you magic.
I will have your hands and feet cut off on alternate sides and crucify you on the trunks of date-palm trees. You will come to know whose punishment is harder and protracted."
They replied: "We cannot choose you in the face of the clear testimony we have received, and over Him who created us. So do what you are determined to do.
All that you would do will only be confined to our life on earth.
We have certainly come to believe in our Lord that He may forgive our trespasses and the magic you have forced us to perform, for God is nobler and abiding."
Surely for him who comes before his Lord a sinner shall be Hell, where he will neither die nor live.
But whoever comes before Him a believer having done good deeds, will be raised to higher stations --
Gardens of Eden with rippling streams, where he will live for ever.
This is the recompense of those who achieve integrity.
We commanded Moses: "Journey by night with Our creatures, and strike a dry path for them through the sea.
Do not fear being overtaken, nor have dread of any thing."
Then the Pharaoh followed them with his army, but the sea overpowered and engulfed them.
The Pharaoh had led his people astray, and did not rightly guide them.
O children of Israel, We delivered you from your enemy, and made a covenant with you on the right side of the Mount, and sent down for you manna and quails,
(And said): "Eat of the good things We have given you for food, and do not exceed the bounds (of law) in this, or My wrath will surely fall upon you; and he who incurs My wrath will fall into the abyss.
Yet I am gracious to him who repents and believes, and does the right, and follows the straight path.
What made you hurry away, O Moses, from your people?"
He said: "They are right behind me. I have hastened to You, O Lord, so that You may be pleased."
He said: "We have put your people on trial in your absence; and Sameri has led them astray."
So Moses returned to his people full of anger and regret.
"O my people," he said, "did not your Lord make you a better promise?
Did the time of covenant seem too long to you? Or did you wish the wrath of your Lord to fall upon you that you broke the promise you had made to me?"
They said: "We did not break our promise to you of our own will, but we were made to carry the loads of ornaments belonging to the people, which we threw (into the fire), and so did Sameri.
Then he produced the image of a calf which mooed like a cow.
And they said: 'This is your god and the god of Moses (whom) he has neglected."
Did they not see that it did not give them any answer, nor had it power to do them harm or bring them gain?
Aaron had indeed told them earlier: "O my people, you are being only misled with this.
Surely your Lord is Ar-Rahman. So follow me and obey my command."
They said "So long as Moses does not come back we are not going to give it up, and we will remain devoted to it."
But (Moses) said: "O Aaron, when you saw that they had gone astray, what hindered you
From coming after me?
Did you not disobey my command?" (And Moses pulled him by the hair).
"O son of my mother," (Aaron cried), do not pull me by my beard or my hair!
I was really afraid you may say that I had created a rift among the children of Israel, and did not pay heed to your command."
Moses asked: "O Sameri, what was the matter?"
He said: "I saw what they did not see.
I picked up a handful of dust from the messenger's tracks and threw it in, for the idea seemed attractive to me."
(Moses) said: "Go hence!
All your life you are (cursed) to say: 'Do not touch me; and a threat hangs over you which you will not be able to escape.
Look at your god to whom you are so attached: We shall verily burn it, and disperse its ashes into the sea.
Your god is only God. There is no other god but He.
His knowledge extends over everything."
Thus do We narrate some account to you of what has gone before, and We have truly given you a Reminder of Our own.
Whoever turns away from it will surely carry a burden on the Day of Judgement,
And will live for ever under it. How evil the burden they will carry on the Day of Doom!
The day the trumpet blast is sounded We shall raise the sinners blind,
Whispering to one another: "You have tarried but ten days."
We know well what they will say when the most upright among them will say: "You did not tarry more than a day."
They will ask you about the mountains.
Tell them: "My Lord will uproot them from the base,
And turn them into a level plain,
Over which you will see no curves or elevations.
That day they will follow the summoner from whom there will be no receding; and their voices will be hushed before Ar-Rahman, and you will not hear a sound but faint shuffling.
On that day no intercession will matter other than his whom Ar-Rahman grants permission and accepts.
He knows what is before them and hidden from them, but they cannot grasp it with their knowledge.
All heads will be bowed before the Living, the Eternal; and whosoever bears a load of iniquity will be full of despair.
But he who has done good things and believes, will have no fear of either being wronged or deprived.
That is why We have sent it down as an eloquent Qur'an, and explained in different ways the intimidations through it that they may haply take heed, or perhaps it may lead them to contemplate.
Exalted then be God, the real King; and do not try to anticipate the Qur'an before the completion of its revelation, but pray: "O Lord, give me greater knowledge."
We had commanded Adam before, but he disregarded it: We found him lacking in resolution.
When We said to the angels: ''Bow before Adam,'' they all bowed but Iblis, who refused.
So We said; "O Adam, he is truly your enemy and your wife's. Do not let him have you turned out of Paradise and come to grief.
Verily you will have no hunger or nakedness there,
Nor thirst nor exposure to the sun."
But then Satan tempted him by saying: "O Adam, should I show you the tree of immortality, and a kingdom that will never know any wane?"
And both ate of (its fruit), and their hidden parts were exposed to one another, and they patched the leaves of the garden (to hide them).
Adam disobeyed his Lord, and went astray.
Then his Lord chose him and relented towards him, and showed him the way;
(And) said: "Go down hence together, one the enemy of the other.
Then will guidance come to you from Me; and whoever follows My direction will neither be disgraced nor be miserable.
But he who fails to heed My warning will have his means restricted; and on the Day of Resurrection We shall raise him blind."
He will ask: "O Lord, why have you raised me blind when I was able to see?"
(God) will say: "Because Our signs came to you, but you disregarded them. So shall We disregard you this day."
And that is how We requite him who is extravagant and does not believe the signs of his Lord; and surely the punishment of the Hereafter is far more severe and persistent.
Did they not learn from the many generations that We destroyed before them, whose habitations they now frequent?
Verily there are signs in this for men of understanding.
If the decree (of respite) had not been pronounced by your Lord, (the inevitable judgement would have ensued); but a term is fixed (for everything).
So you bear with patience what they say, and sing the praises of your Lord before the rising and setting of the sun, and honour Him in the watches of the night, and then at the two ends of day, that you may find acceptance.
Do not covet what We have granted myriads of people of the pomp and glitter of this world to tempt them.
The means your Lord has given you are better far and more enduring.
Enjoin on your people service to God, and be yourself constant in it.
We do not ask you to provide: It is We who provide for you.
The reward is for piety and fear of God.
Yet they say: "Why does he not bring a sign from his Lord?"
Have not clear proofs come to them in what is contained in the earlier Books?
If We had destroyed them by some calamity sooner than this, they would have surely said: "O Lord, if You had sent to us a messenger we would have followed Your command before being humbled and disgraced."
Say: "Each one awaits the consequence; so you wait. You will come to know soon who are the men of the straight path and who have come to guidance.
NEAR HAS COME the reckoning for men, but they turn away in remissness.
Never does a new reminder come to them from their Lord but they listen to it with dalliance.
Their minds are lost in frivolous pastimes; and the evil-doers discuss secretly: "Is he not but only a man like you?
Then why are you taken in by magic seeingly?"
He said: "My Lord knows whatever is spoken in the heavens and the earth. He hears all and knows everything."
Yet they say: "These are only confused dreams," or rather: "He has invented them;" or: "He is only a poet.
Let him therefore bring a miracle to us as the earlier (apostles) were sent with."
Not one habitation that We destroyed before them had believed.
So how can they believe?
Never did We send a message before you but through a man, whom We inspired. If you do not know, then ask the keepers of the oracles of God.
We did not make their bodies immune to hunger, nor were they immortal.
Then We made Our promise good to them and delivered whomsoever We pleased, and destroyed the transgressors.
We have sent down to you a Book which has a reminder for you. Do you not understand?
How many habitations that were sinful have We demolished utterly, and raised other people after them.
Whensoever they sensed Our punishment they fled from them.
"Do not flee; go back to your halls of pleasure and your habitations, so that you may be interrogated."
"Woe, alas," they said, "we were really sinful."
And this remained their lament till We mowed them down and made them extinct.
We have not created the heavens and the earth, and all that lies between them, out of fun.
If We had pleased to make a plaything We could have made it Ourself, if We had cared to do so.
In fact We strike the truth against the false, which shatters it, and it disappears.
Woe to you for what you attribute (to Him)!
Whosoever is in the heavens and the earth belongs to Him; and those who are near Him do not disdain to worship Him or weary (of His service),
Nor cease to endeavour praising Him night and day.
Or have they taken gods from the earth who can raise the dead?
Had there been gods apart from God, both (the heavens and the earth) would have been despoiled.
Much too glorious is God, the Lord of the mighty throne, for things they assert!
He cannot be questioned about what He does, but they will be questioned.
Have they taken gods besides God?
Say: "Then bring your proof.
Here is the Book of those who are with me, and the Book of those who have gone before me."
But most men do not know the truth and turn away.
We have not sent an apostle before you without instructing him that there is no god but I, so worship Me.
And yet they say: "Ar-Rahman has begotten a son."
Too exalted is He!
In fact, those (they call His sons) were His honoured votaries.
They did not precede Him in their speech, and acted on His command.
He knows what was there before them and what came after them; and they did not intercede for any one but whom He willed, and they were filled with awe of Him.
If any one of them said: "I am God besides Him," We should award him Hell; for this is how We requite the evil-doers.
Do not these unbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were an integrated mass, then We split them and made every living thing from water?
Will they not believe even then?
We placed stabilisers in the earth so that as it revolved with them you lived undisturbed; and We provided passageways between them so that men may find their way;
And We made the sky a well-protected roof. Still they turn away from His signs!
It is He who created night and day, the sun and the moon, revolving on its orbit.
We have given no man everlastingness before you.
So then if you die, will they live ever after?
Every soul will know the taste of death. We tempt you with evil and with good as a trial; and to Us you will return.
But when the unbelievers see you they make fun of you (and say): "Is this the one who mentions your gods (deridingly)?" Yet in Ar-Rahman they disbelieve!
Man is made of inordinate haste.
We will show you Our signs, then you will not desire to hasten (the punishment).
Yet they say: "When will the promised threat come to pass, if you speak the truth?"
If only the unbelievers could apprehend the moment when they would neither be able to ward off the fire from their faces and their backs, nor help reach them!
It will come upon them unawares confounding them, and they will not be able to keep it back, nor will they be given respite.
Many apostles have been scoffed before you; but they who scoffed were themselves caught by what they had ridiculed.
Say: "Who guards you from Ar-Rahman by night and by day?"
Yet from a mention of their Lord they turn away.
Or do they have lords of their own besides Us who can defend them?
But they are not able to help themselves, nor can they find protection against Us.
We allowed them and their fathers time to enjoy till the very end of their lives.
Do they not see Us advancing into the land, reducing its frontiers?
Would they still prevail?
Say: "I am warning you by God's command."
But the deaf do not hear the call when they are warned.
Even if a whiff of the Lord's chastisement were to touch them they would surely say: "Ah woe, alas, we were surely sinful."
We shall fix the scales of justice on the Day of Resurrection, so that none will be wronged in the least; and even if it were equal to a mustard seed in weight We shall take it (into account).
We are sufficient for computation.
We gave Moses and Aaron the Criterion, and a light and reminder for those who take heed for themselves,
Who are fearful of their Lord inwardly and dread the Hour.
And this is a blessed reminder that We have sent down.
Will you then deny it?
We had earlier given Abraham true direction, for We knew him well.
When he said to his father and his people: "What are these idols to which you cling so passionately?"
They replied: "We found our fathers worshipping them."
He said: "You and your fathers were in clear error."
They said: "Are you speaking in earnest, or only jesting?"
He said: "In fact it was your Lord, the Lord of the heavens and the earth, who created them; and I bear witness to this.
I swear by God I will do something to your idols when you have turned your backs and gone."
So he smashed them up to pieces with the exception of the biggest, so that they may turn to it.
They asked (on return): "Who has done this to our gods?
He is surely a mischief-monger."
They said: "We heard a youth talk about them. He is called Abraham."
"Bring him before the people," they said, "that they may bear witness."
"Did you do this to our gods, O Abraham?" they enquired.
"No," he said. "It was done by that chief of theirs.
Ask him in case they can speak."
Then they thought and observed: "Surely you are yourselves unjust."
Then crestfallen (they confessed): "Truly, as you know, they cannot speak."
(So Abraham) said: "Then why do you worship something apart from God that cannot profit you or do you harm?
Fie on you and those you worship besides God!
Will you not understand?"
They said: "Burn him, and save your gods, if you are men of action."
"Turn cold, O fire," We said, "and give safety to Abraham."
They wished to entrap him, but We made them greater losers.
So We delivered him and Lot, and brought them to the land We had blessed for all the people.
And We bestowed on him Isaac, and Jacob as an additional gift, and made them righteous.
And We made them leaders to guide (the people) by Our command; and We inspired them to perform good deeds and observe their moral obligations and pay the zakat; and they obeyed Us.
To Lot We gave wisdom and knowledge, and saved him from a people who acted villainously and were certainly wicked and disobedient.
Thus We admitted him to Our grace. He is surely one of the righteous.
Remember Noah when he called to Us before this. We heard him and saved him and those with him from great distress;
And We helped him against the people who rejected Our signs as lies.
They were a wicked people indeed, so We drowned them one and all.
(Remember) David and Solomon, when they pronounced judgement about the field which was eaten up at night by sheep belonging to certain people. We were witness to their judgement.
We made Solomon understand the case, and bestowed on each wisdom and knowledge, We subdued the al-jibal (mountains) with David to sing Our praises, and at-tair (birds). It is We who did it.
And We taught him the art of making coats of mail to shield you from each other's violence.
Will you not be grateful even then?
We made tempestuous winds obedient to Solomon which blew swiftly to sail at his bidding (with his ships) to the land We had blessed.
We are cognisant of everything.
And many of the devils (We also made obedient to him) who dived for him, and did many other things; and We kept watch over them.
(Remember) Job when he called to his Lord: "I am afflicted with distress, and You are the most compassionate of all."
So We heard his cry and relieved him of the misery he was in. We restored his family to him, and along with them gave him others similar to them as a grace from Us and reminder for those who are obedient.
(Remember) Ishmael, Edris and Dhu'l-Kifl. They were men of fortitude,
And they were admitted to Our grace. Verily they were among the doers of good.
And (remember) Dhu'n-Noon (Jonah of the fish), when he went away in anger and imagined We will not test him (with distress). Then he called out from the darkness: "There is no god other than You.
All glory to You; surely I was a sinner.
We heard his cry, and saved him from the anguish. That is how We deliver those who believe.
(Remember) Zachariah when he called to his Lord: "Do not leave me alone (and childless), for you are the best of givers."
So We heard him and gave him John, and cured his wife (of barrenness).
These were men who vied in good deeds with one another, and prayed to Us with love and awe, and were meek before Us.
(Remember) her who preserved her chastity, into whom We breathed a new life from Us, and made her and her son a token for mankind.
Verily this your order is one order, and I am your Lord; so worship Me.
But they split up the order among themselves; (yet) all of them have to come back to Me.
So he who does the right and is a believer, will not have his labour denied, for We are congnisant of it.
It is imperative that a habitation We have destroyed will not desist (from unbelief)
Until when the way is opened up for Gog and Magog and they press from every elevated place,
And the certain promise (of Doom) comes near. Then the eyes of unbelievers will be fixed in horror, (and they will cry:) "Ah, woe betide, we were indeed heedless of this, and were oppressors and unjust."
Verily you and those you worship other than God will be faggots for Hell; and come to it you will.
Had they really been gods they would not have entered it: They will all abide in it for ever.
There will only be groaning for them, and they will not hear any thing.
But those for whom a good reward had been fore-ordained by Us, will be far removed from it,
And will not hear its hissing, and will live for ever in the midst of what their hearts desire.
They will have safety from the mighty terror, and angels will receive them, (saying:) "This is your day which had been promised you."
The day We shall roll up the heavens like a written scroll, We shall revert it (to nothing) as it was before We first created it. This is a promise incumbent on Us; We will certainly fulfil it.
We had prescribed in the Book of Psalms after the reminder and admonition, that those of Our creatures who are good will in the end rule the earth.
Verily there is a message in this for people who are devout.
We have sent you as a benevolence to the creatures of the world.
Say: "This is what has been revealed to me: 'Your God is one and only God.'
So will you bow in homage to Him?"
If they turn away, tell them: "I have warned you all alike. I do not know if what has been promised you is near or far away.
He knows surely what you say aloud, and what you hide within your breasts.
I do not know if this be a trial for you, or a little advantage for a while."
"Judge in truth (between us), O Lord," he said.
"Our Lord is merciful, whose help we seek against what you attribute."
O YOU PEOPLE, fear your Lord. The great upheaval of the Hour will indeed be terrible.
The day you see it every suckling female will forget her suckling, and every pregnant female will discharge her burden. You will see men drunk, yet it will not be intoxication.
And yet there are men who contend about God without understanding, and follow every wayward devil
Who, it is inscribed, will beguile whoever follows him, and lead him to the torment of Hell.
If you have any doubt, O men, about being raised to life again, (remember) that We created you from dust, then a drop of semen, then an embryo, then a chewed up lump of flesh shaped and shapeless, that We may reveal (the various steps) to you.
We keep what We please in the womb for a certain time, then you come out as a child, then reach the prime of age.
Some of you die, some reach the age of dotage when they forget what they knew, having known it once.
You see the earth all withered, then We send down rain upon it, and it bestirs itself, swells, and brings forth every kind of beauteous verdure.
That is so for God is the undeniable Reality. It is He who brings the dead to life, for He has power over everything.
The Hour will come without a doubt, and God will raise those who are dead.
Yet there are some who contend about God without any knowledge or guidance or enlightening Book,
Turning their backs that they may lead away from the path of God. For such there is disgrace in the world, and on the Day of Judgement We shall make them taste the torment of burning.
That is on account of what you had done in the past; yet God is not unjust to His creatures.
There are some men who worship God only from the margin.
If there is some profit they are content; but if calamity befalls them they turn about, thus losing both this world and the next.
This is indeed a palpable loss.
Leaving God they pray to those who cannot harm or profit them.
That is the limit of going astray.
They pray to him whose bane is more imminent than his boon: How bad the protector and how bad the associate!
God will admit those who believe and do the right to gardens full of rippling streams. Verily God does as He pleases.
He who thinks that God will not help him in this world and the next should stretch a rope to the sky then cut it off and see if his mind is relieved (of doubts) by this stratagem.
That is why We have sent down these clear revelations, for God gives guidance whomsoever He please.
God will judge between those who believe and the Jews, the Sabians, Christians and the Magians and the idolaters, on the Day of Judgement. Verily God is witness to everything.
Do you see how all things in heavens and the earth, the sun, the moon, the stars, the mountains, trees and beasts, and men in abundance, pay homage to God?
Yet there are many who deserve the punishment.
And whosoever God disgraces will have none to raise him up in honour.
God does verily as He will.
These two (believers and unbelievers) are disputants, who contend about their Lord.
But they who disbelieve will be fitted out with garments of flames. Boiling water will be poured down over their heads
Which will dissolve everything within their bellies, and their skins.
There are iron maces for them.
As often as they try to escape from its anguish they would be put back into (the fire), and taste the torment of burning.
God will surely admit those who believe and do the right to gardens with rivers running by, where they will be decked in bracelets of gold and of pearls; and of silk will be their garments.
They will be guided with gentle words, and guided to the commended path.
As for those who disbelieve, and obstruct the way of God and the holy Mosque which We have set down for all men, the native and the visitor alike. Whoever puts obstructions in this mischievously will taste of painful punishment.
When We chose the site of the House for Abraham (We said:) "Associate no one with Me, and clean My House for those who will circumambulate it, stand (in reverence), and bow in homage.
Announce the Pilgrimage to the people.
They will come to you on foot and riding along distant roads on lean and slender beasts,
In order to reach the place of advantage for them, and to pronounce the name of God on appointed days over cattle He has given them for food; then eat of the meat and feed the needy and the poor.
Let them then attend to their persons and complete the rites of pilgrimage, fulfil their vows and circuit round the ancient House.
Apart from this, whoever respects the sacred ordinances of God, will find a better reward for him with his Lord.
You are allowed to eat all cattle except those already mentioned to you.
Avoid the repugnance of idols, and false and frivolous talk.
Turn uprightly to God without ascribing compeers to Him; for he who associates any one with God is like a thing that falls from the sky and is either snatched away by birds or carried far away by the wind.
All this, and honouring the offerings to God, comes from purity of heart.
, There are advantages for you in these (cattle) up to a time, then their place is the ancient House for sacrifice.
For every community We have ordained certain rites that they may commemorate the name of God by reading it over the cattle We have given them for sacrifice.
Your God is one God, so be obedient to Him.
Give good tidings to those who bow in obedience to God,
Whose hearts are filled with awe when the name of God is mentioned before them, who endure with fortitude what befalls them, and fulfil their moral obligations, and expend of what We have given them.
We have made the camels signs of God for you.
There is good for you in this.
So pronounce the name of God over them as they stand with their forefeet in a line.
When they have fallen (slaughtered) on their sides, eat of (their meat) and feed those who are content with little, and those who supplicate.
That is why We have brought them under your subjugation so that you may be grateful.
It is not their meat or blood that reaches God: It is the fealty of your heart that reaches him.
That is why He has subjugated them to you that you may glorify God for having shown you the way.
So give glad tidings to those who are doers of good.
God will certainly defend the believers.
Surely God does not like the traitors who deny the truth.
Permission is granted those (to take up arms) who fight because they were oppressed. God is certainly able to give help to those
Who were driven away from their homes for no other reason than they said: "Our Lord is God."
And if God had not restrained some men through some others, monastries, churches, synagogues and mosques, where the name of God is honoured most, would have been razed.
God will surely help those who help Him, -- verily God is all-powerful and all-mighty, --
Those who would be firm in devotion, give zakat, and enjoin what is good and forbid what is wrong, if We gave them authority in the land. But the resultance of things rests with God.
If they accuse you of falsehood, (remember that) the people of Noah, 'Ad and Thamud had accused (their apostles) before,
And the people of Abraham and Lot,
And the people of Midian too.
Moses was also accused of lies.
So I allowed the infidels respite and then seized them. How was My reprobation then!
How many a habitation given to wickedness have We destroyed, whose roofs tumbled down, which fell into ruins. How many a well and fortress reinforced lie abandoned!
Have they not travelled in the land that they could have the heart to understand, and ears to hear?
It is not the eyes alone that do not see, oblivious are the hearts within their breasts.
That is how they ask you to hasten the punishment; but God does not go back on His promise.
Verily a day with your Lord is equal by your reckoning to a thousand years.
To how many habitations did We give respite, though given to wickedness, and then seized them.
To Me they had to come back in the end.
Tell them: "O men, it's my duty to warn you clearly."
For those who believe and do the right is forgiveness and gracious provision.
But those who try to defeat Our signs are people of Hell.
We have sent no messenger or apostle before you with whose recitations Satan did not tamper.
Yet God abrogates what Satan interpolates; then He confirms His revelations, for God is all-knowing and all-wise.
This is in order to make the interpolations of Satan a test for those whose hearts are diseased and hardened: Surely the sinners have gone far in dissent.
At the same time those who have been given knowledge may know that this is the truth from your Lord, and come to believe in it, and their hearts become submissive to Him.
Verily God guides those who believe, to the even path.
The infidels will remain in doubt about it till the Hour overtakes them unawares, or the punishment of the barren day destructive should come upon them.
The order will be God's on that Day; He will judge between them.
Then those who had come to believe and done the right will be in gardens of delight.
But those who did not believe and called Our revelations lies, will be given disgraceful punishment.
Those who left their homes in the way of God, and then were killed or died, will surely be given a better provision by God, for God is surely the best of providers.
God will surely lead them to a place with which they will be gratified.
Verily God is all-knowing and forbearing.
Whosoever retaliates to the extent of injury suffered by him, and is wronged again, will certainly be helped by God.
Verily God is forgiving and kind.
That is so for God turns night into day and day into night, for God is all-hearing and all-seeing;
That is so for God is the undeniable truth, and what they invoke apart from Him is false; yet God is all-high and supreme.
Do you not see how God sends down water from the sky and in the morning the earth turns green?
Truly God is benign and well-informed.
Whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth belongs to Him. Surely God is all-sufficing, worthy of praise.
Do you not see God has harnessed all that is in the earth, to your service? And the boats ply in the ocean by His command.
He holds the sky in position lest it should fall upon the earth save by His dispensation.
Verily God is compassionate and kind to men.
It is He who gives you life, then makes you die; then He will bring you back to life again.
Man is surely most ungrateful.
We have determined for each community a way of worship which they follow. So they should not contend with you in this matter; and you should go on calling them to your Lord.
You are surely on the right path.
If they argue with you, tell them: "God knows well what you are doing.
God will judge between you on the Day of Judgement in what you are at variance."
Do you not know that God knows whatever is in the heavens and the earth?
This is surely in accordance with the law. This is certainly how (the law of) God works inevitably.
Yet they worship in place of God that for which no authority has been sent to them, and of which they have no knowledge.
The wicked will have none to help them.
When Our clear messages are read out to them you can see denial on the faces of unbelievers.
They can hardly restrain themselves from attacking those who recite Our revelations.
Tell them: "Should I give you news of something worse than this?" -- Hell, which God has promised the infidels.
How evil a destination!
O men, give ear to this parable: Those you worship other than God can never create as much as a fly, even if they get together to do so; and if the fly were to rob them of a thing they would not be able to snatch it away from it.
How weak the seeker and how weak the sought!
They do not esteem God with the right estimation.
God is surely all-powerful and all-mighty.
God chooses messengers from the angels and human beings.
Verily God is all-hearing and all-seeing.
He knows what is before them and what lies behind them, and all things go back to God.
O you who believe, bow in adoration, Worship your Lord and do what is good that you may find success.
Strive in the way of God with a service worthy of Him.
He has chosen you and laid no hardship on you in the way of faith, the faith of your forbear Abraham.
He named you Muslim earlier, and in this (Qur'an), in order that the Prophet be witness over you, and you be witness over mankind.
So be firm in devotion, pay the zakat, and hold on firmly to God.
He is your friend: How excellent a friend is He, how excellent a helper!
THE TRUE BELIEVERS will be successful,
Who are humble in their service,
Who shun all frivolities,
Who strive for betterment;
Who guard their sex
Except from their wives and women slaves of old are free of blame,
But those who covet more than this will be transgressors;
And those who fulfil their trusts and keep their promises;
And those who are watchful of their acts of prayer.
These are the real gainers,
Who will inherit Paradise, and live in it for ever.
We created man from the finest extract of clay,
Then We placed him as a sperm in a firmly established lodging;
Then We fashioned the sperm into an embryo, then fashioned the embryo into a shapeless lump of flesh; then from the lump of flesh We fashioned bones, then clothed the bones with flesh. Thus We formed him into a new creation.
So blessed be God the best of Creators.
And then you will certainly die,
Then will be raised up on the Day of Resurrection.
We made several highways one over the other above you. We are not neglectful of creation.
We send down water from the sky in determined measure, and store it up in the earth; and We have power to drain it away.
We grow orchards of dates and grapes from it for you, Which yield fruits in abundance that you eat.
The tree that grows on Mount Sinai yields oil and seasoning for those who eat.
There are lessons for you in the cattle from whose bellies We give you milk to drink, and there are other advantages that you derive from them, and some of them you eat;
And you are carried on them and on boats.
We sent Noah to his people. He said: "O my people, worship God, for you have no other god but He.
Will you not take heed for yourselves?"
The chiefs of his people, who did not believe, said: "He is only a man like you. He wishes to acquire ascendancy over you.
If God had willed He would have sent down angels.
We never heard this from our elders.
He is only a man possessed; so wait and watch him for a time."
"O my Lord," prayed (Noah), "help me against them, for they accuse me of lies."
So We asked him to build the ark under Our eyes and guidance, (and said): "When Our command is issued and the source of water boils over, put a pair of every species in it, and your family except those for whom Our sentence has been passed already; and do not speak to Me for those who are wicked: They will be drowned.
When you and those with you have boarded the ark, say: 'All praise be to God who has delivered us from the people who were sinful.'
And say: 'O Lord, disembark me in a welcome place; You are the best of deliverers.'
There were surely signs in this; We will surely put you to the test.
After them We raised a new generation.
Then We sent to them an apostle from among them (who said): "Worship God, for you have no other god but He.
Will you not take heed and fear God?"
The chiefs of the people who did not believe and denied the life to come, though We had given them good things of this life to enjoy, (said): "He is only a mortal like you.
He eats as you do, and drinks as you drink.
So if you follow a man like yourself you will certainly be doomed.
Does he give you a promise that when you are dead and turned to dust and bones, you will be raised to life again?
How far-fetched what you are promised;
There is only the life of this world: We die and we live: there is no rising from the dead for us.
He is just a man who invents a lie about God; we cannot believe in him."
(The apostle prayed): "O Lord, deliver me, for they accuse me of lies."
Answered (the Lord): "They shall wake up repenting soon."
So they were rightly seized by a mighty blast; and We turned them into mouldy rubbish: A good riddance of the wicked people!
Then after them We raised other generations.
No nation can live beyond its allotted time, or lag behind.
Then We sent Our apostles one after the other.
Every time an apostle came to a people they denied him.
So We made one follow the other (to its doom), and turned them into bygone tales.
Cursed be the people who do not believe!
Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our miracles and clear proofs
To Pharaoh and his nobles who behaved with arrogance, for they were a conceited lot,
And said: "Should we believe in two men like yourselves, whose people are our subjects?"
Then they accused them of lies, and joined the company of those who were destroyed.
And We gave the Book to Moses so that they may be guided.
And We made the son of Mary and his mother a sign, and gave them shelter on an elevated ground, sequestered, watered by a spring.
O you apostles, eat things that are clean, and do things that are good.
We are surely cognisant of what you do.
Verily this your order is one order, and I am your Lord, so fear Me.
But then they divided up their order into different creeds, each section rejoicing in what it had come to have.
So leave them to their ignorance for a time.
Do they think that by increasing their wealth and children
We are hastening to reward them for good deeds?
No. They do not comprehend.
Surely those who live in awe of their Lord,
Who believe in their Lord's revelations,
Who do not associate any one with their Lord,
Who give whatsoever they give (in His way), and their hearts tremble with fear that they have to go back to their Lord,
Are the ones who hasten to goodness and outpace the others.
We do not burden a soul beyond capacity, for We have a record that tells the truth.
No wrong will be done to any one.
Yet their hearts are oblivious of this; and besides, they are busy with other things,
So that when We seize the affluent among them with affliction, they will begin to implore for help.
"Do not supplicate for help today; you will not be rescued by Us;
For when My revelations were read out to you, you turned back on your heels and fled
Insolently, treating them like tales told at night."
Why did they not think over the message? Or has something come to them which had not come to their fathers?
Or did they not recognise their apostle, and rejected him?
Or do they say that he is possessed?
In fact, he has brought the truth to them, but most of them abhor the truth.
Had truth been subject to their whims the heavens and the earth and all those within them would have been depraved.
In fact We had sent them their reminder, but they turned away from good advice.
Or do you ask of them any tribute?
In that case the tribute of your Lord is better, for He is the best of providers.
You are surely calling them to the right path.
But those who believe not in the Hereafter turn away from the straight path.
If We took compassion on them and removed the affliction they are in, they would only wander lost in confusion.
We had seized them with the punishment, but they did not bow before their Lord nor turned to Him in humility,
So that when at last We open up the gate of severe punishment on them they will be overwhelmed with despair.
It is He who gave you hearing, sight, and hearts, but only few of you give thanks.
It is He who multiplied you on the earth, and it will be before Him that you will be gathered.
It is He who gives you life and death, and His the alternation of night and day.
Even then you do not understand,
And talk as did the people of old.
They say: "When we are dead and turned to dust and bones, shall we be raised to life again?
We and our fathers were promised this before; it is nothing but ancient lore!"
Say: "To whom does the earth and whosoever is upon it then belong, if you know?"
They will say: "To God."
Say: "Then why do you not bethink yourselves?"
Say: "Then who is the Lord of the seven skies? And who is the Lord of the mighty Throne?"
They will say: "God."
Say: "Then why do you not obey and fear Him?"
Say: "Whose is the sovereignty over all things, who protects, and against whom there is no protection? {Answer) if you have knowledge."
They will say: "God's."
Say: "Then why are you so deluded?"
In fact We have sent the truth to them, but they are liars.
God has not begotten a son, nor is there any god besides Him. Had this been so, each god would have taken away what he had created with him, and some would have risen over the others.
God is much too glorious for what they attribute (to Him)!
The knower of the absent and the present, too exalted is He for what they associate (with Him)!
Say: "O Lord, if I am made to see what has been promised them,
Then do not, O Lord, put me among the sinners."
We have certainly the power to make you see what We have promised them.
Dispel evil with what is good.
We know well what they attribute (to Us).
Say: "My Lord, I seek refuge in You from the evil promptings of the devils.
I seek refuge in You lest they come to me."
(But the unbelievers will persist) until when death comes to one of them he will say: "O Lord, send me back again
That I may do some good I did not do (in the world)."
Not so. These are only words he utters.
Behind them lies the intervening barrier (stretching) to the day of their resurrection.
When the trumpet blast is sounded no ties of lineage will hold among them, nor will they ask after one another.
Only those whose scales are heavier in the balance will find happiness.
But those whose scales are lighter will perish and abide in Hell for ever.
Their faces will be scorched by flames, and they will grin and scowl within it.
"Were not My messages read out to you? But you denied them."
They will say: "O Lord, our misery overwhelmed us, so we remained a people astray.
Get us out of this, O Lord.
If we transgress we will surely be sinful."
He will say: "Remain condemned in it, and do not speak to Me.
There was a section among My creatures that said: 'O Lord, we believe. Forgive us and have mercy upon us, for You are the best of the merciful.'
But you ridiculed them. So much so that out of (spite) for them you forgot to remember Me and laughed at them.
I have rewarded them this day for they were constant, and they have come to attainment."
They will be asked: "How long did you live on the earth in terms of years?"
They will say: "A day or less than a day. Ask the enumerators of numbers."
He will say: "You stayed there only a moment, if you knew.
Do you think We created you for nothing, and that you will not return to Us?"
Exalted then be God, the King, the Real.
There is no god but He, the Lord of the glorious throne.
Whoever worships another god apart from God, for which he holds no proof, will have to account for it before his Lord.
Verily the unbelievers will not prosper.
Say: "My Lord, forgive and have mercy. You are the best of the merciful."
WE HAVE REVEALED this Surah and made it obligatory as We have sent down clear injunctions in it that you may be warned.
The adulteress and adulterer should be flogged a hundred lashes each, and no pity for them should deter you from the law of God, if you believe in God and the Last Day; and the punishment should be witnessed by a body of believers.
The adulterer can marry no one but an adulteress or his partner (in the act), and the adulteress cannot marry any but an adulterer or her partner (in the act). This is forbidden the believers,
Those who defame chaste women and do not bring four witnesses should be punished with eighty lashes, and their testimony should not be accepted afterwards, for they are profligates,
Except those who repent after this and reform; and God is surely forgiving and kind.
Those who accuse their wives and do not have any witnesses except themselves, should swear four times in the name of God, the testimony of each such person being that he is speaking the truth,
And (swear) a fifth time that if he tell a lie the curse of God be on him.
The woman's punishment can be averted if she swears four times by God as testimony that her husband is a liar,
Her fifth oath being that the curse of God be on her if her husband should be speaking the truth.
(This would not have been possible) if the grace and benevolence of God were not upon you; but God is compassionate and wise.
Those who spread lies were a clique among you.
Do not think that it was bad for you: In fact it has been good for you.
Each of them will pay for the sin he has committed, and he who had greater share (of guilt) will suffer grievous punishment.
Why did the faithful men and women not think well of their people when they heard this, and said: "This is a clear lie?"
Why did they not bring four witnesses (in support of their charge)?
And since they did not bring the four witnesses they are themselves liars in the sight of God.
Were it not for the grace of God and His mercy upon you in this world and the next, you would have suffered a great affliction for the false accusation.
When you talked about it and said what you did not know, and took it lightly -- though in the sight of God it was serious --
Why did you not say when you heard it: "It is not for us to speak of it?
God preserve us, it is a great calumny!"
God counsels you not to do a thing like this, if you are believers.
God explains His commands to you clearly, for God is all-knowing and all-wise.
There is painful punishment in this world and the next for those who like that immorality should spread among the believers, for God knows and you do not know.
But for the grace of God and His mercy (much harm would have been done); yet God is compassionate and kind.
O you who believe, do not follow in the footsteps of Satan, for he who follows in the footsteps of Satan will be induced by him to what is shameful and forbidden.
But for the grace of God and His mercy upon you none of you would have escaped undefiled; but God makes whosoever He will grow in goodness, for God is all-hearing and all-knowing.
Let not those who are men of plenty and means among you swear that they will not give to their relatives and the poor and those who leave their homes in the service of God.
They should forgive and overlook (their failings).
Would you not like God to forgive you?
And God is forgiving and kind.
Verily those who blaspheme unsuspecting chaste believing women will be cursed in this world and the next; and for them there will be severe punishment.
The day their tongues and hands and feet bear witness to what they had done,
God will pay them on that day their just due in full, and they will come to know that God is the tangible Reality.
Bad women deserve bad men, and bad men are for bad women; but good women are for good men, and good men for good women, for they are innocent of what people say.
There is forgiveness for them and a gracious provision.
O you who believe, do not enter other houses except yours without first asking permission and saluting the inmates.
This is better for you: You may haply take heed.
If you find that no one is in, then do not enter unless you have received permission.
If you are asked to go away, turn back. That is proper for you.
God is aware of what you do.
There is no harm in going into uninhabited houses where there is some convenience for you, as God has knowledge of what you hide and what you disclose.
Tell the believing men to lower their eyes and guard their private parts.
There is for them goodness in this.
God is aware of what they do.
Tell the believing women to lower their eyes, guard their private parts, and not display their charms except what is apparent outwardly, and cover their bosoms with their veils and not to show their finery except to their husbands or their fathers or fathers-in-law, their sons or step-sons, brothers, or their brothers' and sisters' sons, or their women attendants or captives, or male attendants who do not have any need (for women), or boys not yet aware of sex.
They should not walk stamping their feet lest they make known what they hide of their Ornaments.
O believers, turn to God, every one of you, so that you may be successful.
Marry off those who are single among you, and those of your male and female servants who are righteous.
If they are poor, God will enrich them of His grace, for God is bounteous and all-knowing.
Those who cannot afford to marry should abstain from what is unlawful until God enriches them by His grace.
And free those slaves you possess who wish to buy their freedom after a written undertaking, if you know they have some goodness, and give them out of the riches God has given you.
Do not force your maids to prostitution if they wish to lead married lives, in order to get the benefits of this world.
But if someone forces them, surely God (will forgive them) after their forced helplessness, for He is forgiving and kind.
We have sent down clear instructions to you, and illustrations from (the accounts) of those who have gone before you, and a warning for those who take heed for themselves.
God is the light of the heavens and the earth.
The semblance of His light is that of a niche in which is a lamp, the flame within a glass, the glass a glittering star as it were, lit with the oil of a blessed tree, the olive, neither of the East nor of the West, whose oil appears to light up even though fire touches it not, -- light upon light.
God guides to His light whom He will.
So does God advance precepts of wisdom for men, for God has knowledge of everything.
(The light is lit) in houses of worship which God has allowed to be raised, and His name remembered in them.
His praises are sung there morning and evening,
By men not distracted from the remembrance of God either by trade and commerce or buying and selling, who stand by their devotional obligations and pay the zakat, who fear the day when hearts and eyes would flutter with trepidation
That God may reward them for the best of their deeds, and bestow more on them of His bounty, for God gives whom He please without measure.
As for those who disbelieve, their deeds are like a mirage in the desert which the thirsty takes for water till he reaches it to find that there was nothing, and finds God with him who settles his account, for God is swift at the reckoning.
Or like darkness in a wide, wide sea, waves surging upon waves, with clouds overhanging, darkness on darkness.
If you stretch your hand, you could hardly see it. For him whom God does not give any light, there is no light.
Have you not seen that all those who are in the heavens and the earth, and the birds on the wing, sing the praises of God.
Each one knows its obligations and its duties, and God knows whatever they do.
For God's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and the returning is to God.
Have you not seen that God drives the clouds, then joins them together and puts them fold on fold. Then you see the rain fall through them; and He sends down hail from the sky where there are mountains of it, and strikes those with it whom He will, and wards it off from whomsoever He please.
His lightning could snatch away their eyes.
It is God who alternates night and day.
There is surely a lesson in this for men of sight.
God created every moving thing from water: One crawls on its belly, one walks on two legs, another moves on four.
God creates whatsoever He will.
Indeed God has power over everything.
We have surely sent down clear signs.
It is God who guides whom He will to the path that is straight.
They say they believe in God and the Prophet, and have come to believe, yet a section of them turns back even after this; and these are not believers.
When they are called to God and His Prophet, that he may judge between them, a section of them turns away.
Had right been on their side they would have come to him submissively.
Is there a malady in their hearts, or they are deluded, or afraid that God and His Prophet would be unjust in dealing with them?
Not so; they are themselves unjust.
The answer of the believers when they are called to God and His Apostle that he may judge between them, is: "We hear and obey."
And they are the ones who will prosper.
Whoever obeys God and His Prophet, fears God and does his duty to Him, will surely find success.
They swear solemnly by God: "If you command us we shall go forth."
Say: "Do not swear.
What is wanted is obedience, as should be.
God is certainly aware of what you do."
Say: "Obey God and obey the Apostle.
If you turn away, then for him is his duty to fulfil, and for you the burden that you carry; yet if you obey him you will be rightly guided.
The duty of the Messenger is to convey the message clearly.
God has promised to make those of you who believe and do the right, leaders in the land, as He had made those before them, and will establish their faith which He has chosen for them and change their fear into security. They will worship Me and not associate any one with Me.
But those who disbelieve after this will be reprobates.
So observe your devotional obligations, pay the zakat, and obey the Apostle so that you may be shown mercy.
Do not think that unbelievers will subvert (the authority of God) on earth. Their abode is Hell; and what an evil destination!
O you who believe, let your dependants and those who have not yet reached the age of puberty, ask permission (to enter your presence) on three occasions: Before the early morning prayer; when you disrobe for the mid-day siesta; and after prayer at night. These are the three occasions of dishabille for you.
There is no harm if you or they visit one another at other times (without permission).
God thus explains things to you clearly, for God is all-knowing and all-wise.
When your children have reached the age of puberty, they should similarly ask your leave (for entering) as others did before them.
God thus clearly explains His commands to you, for God is all-knowing and all-wise.
As for your women past the age of bearing children, who have no hope of marriage, there is no harm if they take off their outer garments, but in such a way that they do not display their charms; yet if they avoid this it would be better for them.
God is all-hearing and all-knowing.
There is no harm if the blind, the lame, the sick, or you yourselves, eat in your own houses or the houses of your fathers, mothers, or your brothers' houses, or those of your sisters, or your fathers' brothers' or sisters', or your mothers' brothers' or sisters', or in the houses whose care is entrusted to you, or the houses of your friends.
There is no harm in your eating together or separately. But when you enter the houses, salute the inmates with a greeting in the name of God, invoking blessings and good health.
That is how God explains things to you clearly so that you may understand. They alone are true believers who believe in God and His Apostle, and when they are with him on a matter of common concern, do not depart without obtaining his leave.
Surely those who ask leave of you are the ones who believe in God and His Apostle. Therefore when they ask leave of you for personal business give leave to those you please, and seek God's forgiveness for them.
Surely God is forgiving and kind.
Do not consider your being summoned by the Apostle to be like your summoning one another.
God knows those of you who go away surreptitiously.
So let those who act in contravention of his command take heed lest a trial should befall them or a grievous punishment come upon them.
Does not everything in the heavens and the earth belong to God?
He surely knows what state you are in; and on the day they go back to Him. He will tell them what they used to do, for God has knowledge of everything.
BLESSED IS HE who revealed the Criterion (of right and wrong) to His votary that it may be a warning for the world, --
He to whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, who has neither begotten a son nor has He a partner in His kingdom, (who) created everything and determined its exact measure.
Yet they choose apart from Him gods who have not created any thing and have themselves been created, who possess no power over their loss or gain, or their death or life or being raised to life again.
Yet the unbelievers say: "This is nothing but a lie he has concocted in which others have aided him."
They have come down to mischief and lies.
And they say: "These are fables of antiquity he has invented, which are dictated to him morning and evening."
Say: "He who knows the secrets of the heavens and the earth has revealed it to me; and He is surely forgiving and kind."
But they say: "What sort of prophet is this who eats food and walks the market places?
Why was no angel sent to him to act as admonisher with him?
Or a treasure should have been given to him, or he should have had an orchard from which he could eat."
And these wicked people say: "You only follow a man ensorcelled."
Just see what comparisons they bring up for you!
They are lost and cannot find the way.
Blessed be He who, if He pleased, could give you better than that, -- gardens with rivers flowing by; and make palaces for you.
Yet they reject the Hour as untrue. We have prepared a Fire for those who deny the Resurrection.
When (Hell) appears to them from a distance they will hear it raging and roaring.
And when they are cast within a narrow space of it chained together, they would plead for death.
"Do not ask for one death but many deaths on this day."
Ask them: "Is this better or a garden for everlasting abode which has been promised the pious and devout?
It would be their guerdon and their destination.
There will they have whatever they wish, and there abide for ever."
This is a promise incumbent on your Lord which will certainly be fulfilled.
The day He will gather them together along with those they worshipped other than God, He will ask them: "Did you lure these creatures of Mine away, or did they themselves go astray?"
They will answer: "Glory to You.
It was not worthy of us to seek any protector other than You. But You allowed them and their fathers a life of ease until they turned oblivious of the Reminder.
(The idolaters will be told): "Your gods have refuted your assertion. You can neither avert (your doom) nor receive any help.
We shall make the wicked among you taste of severe punishment."
We never sent before you apostles who did not eat food and walk the market places.
We make some of you the means of trying the others.
So will you persevere?
Your Lord is always watching.
Those who do not hope to meet Us say: "Why are no angels sent down to us, or why do we not see our Lord?"
They are full of self-conceit and behave with intense arrogance.
The day they see the angels there will be no happy tidings for the sinners; and they will say: "There is an insurmountable barrier!"
We shall turn to their deeds and scatter them like particles of dust.
The inmates of Paradise will have a better abode that day, and a better resting place.
The day the heavens splits asunder with a dazzling white cloud gathering and the angels descend in a continuous stream,
The real sovereignty will belong to Ar-Rahman. How grievous will be the day for the infidels!
The sinner will then bite his hand and say: "Would that I had taken the road with the Prophet.
Woe alas, ah would I had not taken so-and-so as friend!
He led me astray from the Warning after it had come to me.
Satan always betrays man.
The prophet will say: "O my Lord, my people had fettered the Qur'an."
Thus do We keep opponents among the sinners for every apostle; yet your Lord is sufficient as a guide and helper.
The unbelievers say: "Why was the whole Qur'an not sent down all at once to him?"
It was sent thus that We may keep your heart resolute. So We enunciated it by steps and distinctly.
There is not an example they advance to which We do not give you a right answer and a better explanation.
Those who will be pushed faces forward into Hell will be in a worse position, farther away from the path.
We gave Moses the Book, and made his brother Aaron his minister,
Then We told them: "Go to the people who have rejected Our signs." Then We annihilated them completely.
We had drowned the people of Noah when they had accused the apostles of lies, and turned them into an example for men.
We have prepared a painful punishment for the wicked.
(As for) 'Ad, Thamud and the people of ar-Rass, and many generations in between them,
We administered warnings to each of them, and then destroyed them completely.
They must have surely passed by the town on which We had rained the terrible rain of ruin.
How could they not have seen it?
Still they do not dread the Resurrection.
When they see you they take you only in jest: "Is this the one whom God has sent as messenger?
He would have surely turned us away from our gods if we had not adhered to them."
They will know soon who is farther away from the path when they see the punishment!
Have you considered him who takes his own lust for his god?
Can you stand a surety for him?
Or do you think that most of them hear or understand?
They are no better than cattle; in fact they are farther astray from the path.
Have you not seen how your Lord lengthens out the shadow?
He could have kept it motionless if He liked.
Yet We make the sun its pilot to show the way.
Then We draw it back to Us, withdrawing it little by little.
It is He who made the night a covering for you; and made sleep for rest, the day for rising.
It is He who sends the winds with auspicious news in advance of His benevolence; and We send pure water down from the sky
To quicken a region that was dead, and to give it as drink to animals We have created and to men in plenty.
And We distribute it among them in various ways that they may ponder and reflect; yet most men disdain everything but denial and thanklessness.
Had We pleased We could have raised a warner in every town.
So do not listen to unbelievers, and strive against them with greater effort.
It is He who made two bodies of water flow side by side, one fresh (and) sweet, the other brine (and) bitter, and has placed an interstice, a barrier between them.
It is He who created man from water, then gave him consanguinity and affinity. Your Lord is omnipotent.
And yet they worship besides God what cannot bring them gain or do them harm.
The unbeliever has always been an auxiliary against his Lord.
Yet We have not sent you but to give good tidings and to warn.
Tell them: "I do not ask any recompense of you for this other than (urging) whoever likes may take the way to his Lord."
Have trust in God the Living, who will never die, and sing His hallelujas; for He is well aware of the sins of His creatures.
He created the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them in six spans then assumed His authority.
He is the benevolent: Ask those who are well-informed.
When you say to them: "Bow before Ar-Rahman," they say: "What is Ar-Rahman?
Should we adore whoever you ask us to?"
And their aversion increases further.
Blessed is He who placed in the heavens constellations of stars, and placed a burning lamp in it and the luminous moon.
It is He who made the night and day an alternation for him who cares to reflect and be grateful.
Devotees of Ar-Rahman are those who walk with humility on the earth, and when they are addressed by the ignorant, say: 'Peace;"
And those who spend their nights bowed and standing before their Lord;
Who say: "O our Lord, avert from us the torment of Hell: Its punishment is surely continuous.
It is indeed an evil halt and an evil abode;"
Who are neither prodigal nor miserly in their spending but follow a middle path;
Who do not invoke any god apart from God, who do not take a life which God has forbidden except for a cause that is just, and do not fornicate -- and any one who does so will be punished for the crime,
Whose punishment will be doubled on the Day of Judgement, and he will live for ever in disgrace,
Except those who repent and come to believe and do the right, for whom God will turn evil into goodness, for God is forgiving and kind.
Whosoever repents and does the right, will have turned back to God by way of repentance;
And those who do not give false evidence, and if they come across unbecoming talk ignore it and pass by in a sedate way;
Who, when reminded of their Lord's revelations, do not fall for them like the deaf and blind;
And those who say: "O Lord, give us comfort in our spouses and children, and make us paragons of those who follow the straight path."
They will be rewarded for their perseverance with lofty mansions in empyrean where they will be received with greetings of peace and salutations,
And abide there for ever: What an excellent destination and abode!
Say: "My Lord is not concerned on your account if you do not pray to Him.
You have surely done with denying; soon will come the inevitable judgement.
TA SIN MIM.
These are the verses of the perspicuous Book.
You may perhaps wear out your heart because they do not come to belief.
We could send down from the heavens a sign to them if We pleased, before which their heads would remain bowed.
Never does a new reminder come to them from Ar-Rahman but they turn away from it.
Surely they have done with denying; soon will come to them the news of what they were laughing at.
Do they not see the earth, how We grow all kinds of noble things upon it?
Verily there are signs in this; yet many of them do not believe.
Your Lord is surely mighty and merciful.
When your Lord called upon Moses: "Go to the wicked people,
The people of Pharaoh.
Will they not fear and take heed?"
: He said: "O Lord, I fear that they will deny me.
My heart is constrained, my tongue falters, so delegate Aaron;
And they have a charge (of murder) against me. So I fear that they will kill me."
(It was) said: "By no means.
Go with My signs, both of you.
I am verily with you and I hear.
Go to the Pharaoh and tell him: 'We bring a message from the Lord of all the worlds
That you should send the children of Israel with us.'
(The Pharaoh) said: "Did we not bring you up as a child?
And you lived a number of years of your life with us.
And you commited what you did, and you are ungrateful!"
(Moses) replied: "I did do that and I was in the wrong,
So I ran away from you out of fear. But my Lord has given me wisdom, and made me an apostle.
But the favour you oblige me with is that you have enslaved the children of Israel."
The Pharaoh asked: "And what is the Lord of all the worlds?"
(Moses) said: "The Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them, if you can believe."
(The Pharaoh) said to those around him: "Do you hear?"
(Moses continued): "Your Lord and the Lord of your fathers before you."
(The Pharaoh) said (to his nobles): "Your apostle who has been sent to you, is certainly mad."
(Moses) said: "The Lord of the East and the Lord of the West and all that lies between them, if you have sense."
(The Pharaoh) said: "If you took another god apart from me I will have you incarcerated."
(Moses) said: "Even though I have brought to you something convincing?"
(The Pharaoh) said: "Then bring it, if you speak the truth."
So (Moses) cast his staff, and lo, it turned into a living serpent.
And he drew forth his hand, and lo, it looked white to the beholders.
The Pharaoh said to the chiefs around him: "He is certainly a clever magician.
He wants to drive you out of your land by his magic.
So, what do you bid?"
They said: "Put him and his brother off awhile, and send summoners to the cities to gather
And bring the ablest magicians to you."
So the magicians were assembled at a stated time and place on an appointed day.
And the people were also asked to assemble.
(They said): "We may haply follow the magicians if they are victorious."
When the magicians arrived, they said to the Pharaoh: "Is there a reward for us if we are victorious?" --
"Yes," he replied. "You 'will be among the honoured."
Moses said to them: "Cast what you have to cast."
So they cast their ropes and rods, and said: "By the glory of Pharaoh, we shall be victorious."
Then Moses threw down his staff, and lo, it swallowed up their conjurations.
Then the magicians fell prostrating in adoration,
And said: "We (affirm and) believe in the Lord of all the worlds,
The Lord of Moses and Aaron."
Said (the Pharaoh): "You have come to believe in him before I gave you leave.
He is surely your chief, who taught you magic.
You will soon come to know: I will have your hands and feet cut off on alternate sides, and have every one of you crucified."
They said: "There will be no harm. We shall return to our Lord.
We certainly hope our Lord will forgive our sins as we are the first to believe."
We said to Moses: "Travel by night with My creatures. You will surely be pursued."
Then the Pharaoh sent announcers to the cities,
(Proclaiming): "Surely they are a small band (of fugitives).
They are always harassing us.
But we are a fully accounted army."
So We made them leave the gardens and springs of water,
And treasures and agreeable mansions.
Thus it was; and We made the children of Israel possess them.
But they pursued them at sunrise.
When the two forces drew within seeing distance of each other, the people of Moses said: "We shall certainly be overtaken."
Moses replied: "By no means.
My Lord is with me.
He will show me the way."
We commanded Moses: "Smite the sea with your staff."
And it parted, and every parting was like a lofty mountain.
Then We brought the others to that place.
We delivered Moses and every one with him,
And We drowned the others.
Verily there is a sign in this, but most of them do not believe.
Indeed your Lord is mighty and merciful.
Relate the news of Abraham to them.
When he asked his father and his people: "What do you worship?"
They replied: "We worship idols and are devoted to them."
(Abraham) asked: "Do they hear when you call them?
Or do they benefit you, or do you harm?"
They said: "No. But we found our fathers doing so."
He said: "Have you considered what you have been worshipping,
You and your fathers?
Yet they are my enemies except the Lord of all the worlds
Who created me and showed me the way,
Who gives me food and drink,
And heals me when I am sick,
Who will make me die, then give me life again,
And who, I hope, will condone my faults on the Day of Judgement.
O Lord, give me wisdom and admit me among the righteous,
And uphold my name with posterity,
And put me among the inheritors of Paradise.
Forgive me and my father: He was surely among those who went astray.
And do not disgrace me on the day when they are raised from the graves,
The day when neither wealth nor children will be of any avail
But to him who comes to God with a tranquil heart."
Paradise will be brought near those who take heed for themselves and follow the straight path;
And Hell made visible to those who had gone astray.
They will be asked: "Where are those you worshipped
Other than God?
Can they save you or even save themselves?"
They will then be thrown into Hell with those who had gone astray
Together with the hordes of Iblis.
Disputing among themselves they will say:
"By God, we were plainly in error
In equating you with the Lord of all the worlds;
No one but the sinners led us astray.
Now we have none to intercede for us,
Nor any sincere friend.
If only we could return and be among the believers!"
Verily there is a sign in this, but many of them do not believe.
Verily your Lord is mighty and merciful.
The people of Noah accused the apostles of lies.
When their brother Noah said to them: "Will you not take heed?
I have been sent as a trusted messenger to you.
So be fearful of God and listen to me.
I ask no recompense of you for it. My reward is due from none but the Lord of all the worlds.
So fear God and follow me."
They said: "Should we place our trust in you when only the condemned follow you?"
He said: "It is not for me to know what they were doing.
It is for my Lord to bring them to book, if you can understand.
I am certainly not one to drive away the believers.
I am only a plain admonisher."
They said: "If you do not desist, O Noah, you will be stoned to death."
He prayed: "O Lord, verily my people accuse me of lies.
So adjudge between me and them conclusively, and save me and the believers who are with me."
So We delivered him and those with him in the loaded ark,
And drowned the rest of them.
Verily there is a sign in this, yet many of them do not believe.
But surely your Lord is mighty and merciful.
The people of 'Ad accused the messengers of lies.
When their brother Hud said to them: "Will you not take heed?
I have been sent as a trusted messenger to you.
So fear God and listen to me.
I ask no recompense of you for it. My reward is due from none but the Lord of all the worlds.
You construct monuments on every hill in vain,
Erect palaces (thinking) that you will live for ever,
And whenever you apply force become tyrannical.
So be fearful of God and follow me.
Fear Him who has bestowed on you what you know,
Gave you increase of cattle and sons,
And orchards and springs.
I fear the punishment of a terrible day for you.
They said: "It is the same to us if you warn us or do not warn.
This is just a habit of antiquated people.
We are not going to be damned."
Then they accused him of lies; so We annihilated them.
Verily there is a sign in this, but most of them do not believe.
Yet surely your Lord is mighty and merciful.
The Thamud accused the messengers of lies.
When their brother Saleh said to them: "Will you not take heed?"
I have been sent as a trusted messenger to you.
So fear God and follow me.
I do not ask any recompense of you for this. My reward is due from none but the Lord of all the worlds.
(Do you think) you will be left secure here
In these gardens and these springs,
The fields of corn and date-palm trees with soft and tender spathes,
And dwellings hewed out of mountains ingeniously?
So be mindful of God and listen to me.
Do not follow those who are extravagant,
Who corrupt the land and do not reform it."
They said: "Surely you are deluded.
You are nothing but a man like us.
Bring us a token if you speak the truth."
(Saleh) said: "Here is a she-camel. She has a right of drinking water, and you have a right of drinking it on appointed turns.
Do not treat her unkindly or the punishment of a grievous day will fall on you."
But they hamstrung her; and on the morrow were repentant,
For they were seized by the torment.
Verily there was a sign in this, but most of them did not believe.
Yet verily your Lord is mighty and merciful.
The people of Lot accused the messengers of lies.
When their brother Lot said to them: "Will you not take heed?
I have been sent as a trusted messenger to you.
So fear God and listen to me.
I ask no recompense of you for this. My reward is due from none but the Lord of all the worlds.
Why do you go for males unlike all other creatures
Leaving the consorts your Lord has made for you?
But you are a people who exceed the bounds."
They said: "If you do not desist, O Lot, you will be expelled (from the city)."
(Lot) said: "I am disgusted with your actions,"
(And prayed:) "O Lord, save me and my family from what they do."
So We saved him and his whole family
Except one old woman who remained behind.
Then We destroyed the rest of them,
And rained on them a shower (of Stones). How terrible was the rain (that fell) on those who had been warned!
Verily in this was a sign, but most of them do not believe.
Yet surely your Lord is mighty and powerful.
The people of the Wood too called the messengers liars.
When Shu'aib said to them: "Will you not take heed?
I have been sent as a trusted messenger to you.
So fear God and follow me.
I ask no recompense of you for this. My reward is due from none but the Lord of all the worlds.
Give full measure and do not cheat;
Weigh on an even balance.
And do not withhold from people what belongs to them, and do not corrupt the land;
And fear Him who created you and all the earlier people."
They said: "Surely you are deluded.
You are nothing but a man like us, and we think you are a liar.
But in case you are speaking the truth, then make a segment of the sky to fall upon us."
(Shu'aib) said: "My Lord knows well what you are doing."
But they denied him, and We seized them with the torment of the Day of Shadowing (when the cloud had rained down fire).
It was indeed the torment of a terrible day!
Verily in this was a sign, but most of them do not believe.
Yet verily your Lord is mighty and merciful.
And this (Qur'an) is a revelation from the Lord of all the worlds,
Which the trusted spirit descended with
To (communicate) to your heart that you may be a warner
In eloquent Arabic.
This is (indicated) in the Books of earlier people.
Was it not a proof for them that the learned men of Israel knew about this?
Had We revealed it to a man of obscure tongue
And he had recited it to them, and they had not believed (it would have been different).
Thus do We cause (unbelief) to enter the hearts of sinners.
They will not believe it until they behold the painful punishment.
It will come upon them unawares, and they will not comprehend it.
Then will they say: "Can we be given respite?"
Do they wish Us then to hasten the punishment?
Just think: If We let them enjoy (the good things of life) for a few years more,
And then what they were promised comes upon them,
Of what avail shall their enjoyment be to them?
Never have We destroyed a habitation till We had sent admonishers to them
To warn. For We are never unjust.
The devils did not bring it down:
They are not worthy of it, nor have they power.
They have been precluded from hearing it.
So call on no other god but God, lest you are condemned to torment;
And warn your near relations,
And take those believers under your wing who follow you.
If they do not obey you, tell them: "I am not responsible for what you do."
Have trust in the Mighty, the Merciful,
Who watches you when you get up,
And your movements among those who bow in homage to God.
He is all-hearing and all-knowing.
Should I tell you on whom the devils descend?
They come down to every mendacious sinner,
Who listens to you (for spreading rumours); but most of them are liars.
As for the poets, only those who go astray follow them.
Have you not seen that they wander distract in every valley,
And they say what they do not do,
Except those who believe and do the right, and remember God a great deal, who retaliate only when they have been wronged.
Yet the oppressors will now come to know through what reversals they will be overthrown!
TA SIN.
THESE are the verses of the Qur'an, and collection of explicit laws,
A guidance and good tidings for the believers,
Who fulfil their devotional obligations, pay the zakat, and believe with certainty in the life to come.
We make their deeds attractive to those who do not believe in the Hereafter, so that they may wander in perplexity.
They are those who will suffer the worst chastisement in this life, and will be the greatest losers in the life to come.
You have been conveyed the Qur'an from One all-wise and all-knowing.
(Remember) when Moses said to his family: "I see a fire.
I shall bring you news from it, or bring an ember that you may warm yourselves."
But when he reached it, a voice called out: "Blessed is He who is in the fire and all around it. Praised be God, the Lord of all the worlds.
O Moses, I am that God, the mighty and all-wise.
Throw down your staff."
When he saw it wriggling like a serpent he turned his back and fled without turning (to look).
"O Moses," (said the voice), "be not fearful.
Surely those sent as messengers do not fear in My presence,
Except those who do some wrong but afterwards do good to make up for the wrong. And I am forgiving and merciful.
Put your hand in the bosom of your shirt; it will come out white without any blemish. This will be one of nine tokens for the Pharaoh and his people, who are a wicked lot indeed."
And when Our signs came as distinct proofs, they said: "This is only magic."
And they denied them out of malice and pride, though in their hearts they believed that they were true.
So see how was the end of evil-doers!
We gave David and Solomon knowledge; and they said: "All praise be to God who has favoured us over many of His creatures who believe."
Solomon was heir to David, and he said: "O people, we have been taught the language of Tair, and have been given of everything.
This is a clear favour indeed."
His armies of jinns and men and Tair assembled, formed into ranks, (and marched)
Till they reached the Valley of Naml. Said the lady of Naml: "O Naml, go into your dwellings lest Solomon and his hordes should crush you unawares."
(Solomon) smiled, amused at her speech, and said: "O Lord grant me that I should be grateful for the favours You have bestowed on me and my parents, and do good things of Your pleasing; and admit me among Your righteous devotees by Your grace."
When he reviewed the Tair, he said: "How is it I do not see Hud-hud?
Is he absent?
I will punish him severely, or cut his throat, unless he bring a valid excuse."
But he was not long in coming, and reported: "I have been around where you have not been. I come from Saba with positive news.
I found a woman reigning over them, and she has been favoured with everything; and she has a throne that is magnificent.
I found that she and her people worship the sun in place of God, for Satan has made their deeds look attractive to them and has turned them away from the Path, so they do not find the way
To worship God who brings to light what is hidden in the heavens and the earth, and is cognisant of what you hide and what you disclose.
God: There is no god but He, the Lord of the glorious throne."
(Solomon) said: 'We shall see if you speak the truth or you are a liar.
Take this letter from me, and deliver it to them and withdraw, then see what reply they give in return."
(The Queen said): "O nobles, a venerable letter has been delivered to me.
It is from Solomon, and (says): 'In the name of Allah, Ar-Rahman, Ar-Rahim.
Do not rise against me, but come to me in submission.'
." Advise me, O nobles," she said "in this matter.
I do not decide any thing until you concur."
They said: "We are men of valour, and brave fighters. It is for you to decide.
She said: "Surely when kings enter a city they destroy it and despoil the honour of its nobility.
So will they do (to us).
But I will send them a gift and see what the envoys bring back (in return)."
So, when the envoys came to Solomon he said: "Do you wish to increase my wealth?
Yet what God has given me is better than what He has given you.
No. Be gratified in your present.
We shall soon come with our armies which they will not be able to face. We shall drive them out of (the land) with ignominy, and they will be humbled."
He (then) said (to his courtiers): "O you nobles, is there any one who can bring me her throne before they come to me in submission?"
A crafty jinn said: "I will bring it before you rise from your seat, for I am strong and trustworthy."
But one who had knowledge of the letter, said: "I will bring it to you in the twinkling of an eye."
When Solomon saw it before him, (he said): "This is by the grace of my Lord that He may test me whether I am grateful or I am thankless.
Yet if one is grateful, he is grateful for himself, and if one is thankless, then surely my Lord is unconcerned and magnanimous."
(Turning to his nobles) he said: "Change the appearance of her throne. Let us see if she is rightly guided, or is not guided at all."
When she arrived, they asked her: "Is your throne like this?"
She said: "As though this is it.
We had come to have knowledge and already submitted."
She was (in fact) turned away by what she worshipped other than God, for she came of an unbelieving people.
She was invited to enter the court.
When she saw it, she took it for a sheet of water, and (pulling up her skirts) uncovered her legs.
(Solomon) told her: "This is paved with tiles of glass."
"O Lord," she said, "I have wronged myself, and I submit to the Lord of all the worlds with Solomon."
We sent to Thamud their brother Saleh (who said): "Worship God."
But they were divided into two groups disputing with one another.
(Saleh) said: "O people, why do you wish to hasten evil rather than good?
Why not ask for God's forgiveness? You may well be forgiven."
They said: "You betoken evil, and those with you."
(Saleh) replied: "The evil you presage can only come from God.
In reality you are a people under trial (for your own inauspiciousness)."
There were in that city nine persons who spread disorder in the land, and did not reform.
They said: "Let us swear by God that we will attack Saleh and his family at night, and later tell his heirs: 'We did not see his family destroyed, and we speak the truth.'"
They hatched up the plot; We also planned without their knowledge.
Now see the end of their machinations: We destroyed them and their entire people.
So these their habitations lie deserted now because of their iniquities.
Verily there is a sign in this for those who understand.
We deliver those who believe and take heed for themselves.
(Remember) Lot, when he said to his people: "Why do you indulge in obscenities when you know (it is evil)?
You lust after men in place of women.
You are indeed a stolid people."
His people had no answer except saying: "Expel the family of Lot from your city. They are a people who would (rather) be pure!"
So We saved him and his family except his wife who was destined to stay behind.
And We rained down on them a shower (of stones). How ruinous was the rain that fell on those who had been warned (but warned in vain)!
Say: "All praise be to God, and peace on those of His creatures whom He has chosen."
Is God better or those they associate with Him --
Who created the heavens and the earth, who sends down water from the sky for you, with which He causes graceful gardens to grow?
It was not in your power to make trees germinate.
Is there any other god along with God.
In fact they are a people who turn away (from the truth).
Who then made the earth a habitable place, and made the rivers (flow) in its valleys and dales, and placed upon it firm stabilisers, and kept a barrier between two bodies of water?
Is there any other god along with God?
In reality most of them do not know.
Who hears the cry of the anguished (soul) when it calls to Him, and relieves its suffering? And who made you trustees on the earth?
Is there any other god along with God?
How little it is that you reflect!
Who then really shows you the way in the darkness of the desert and the sea? And who sends breezes bringing news of His benevolence?
Is there any other god along with God?
He is far too exalted for what they associate with Him!
Who creates first then reverts it? And who gives you provision from the heavens and the earth?
Is there any other god along with God?
Tell them: "Bring your proof, if you are truthful."
Say: "No one in the heavens and the earth has knowledge of the unknown except God, nor can they know when they will be raised again.
Still less do they comprehend the life to come. In fact they are in doubt about it.
Those who do not believe, say: "When we and our fathers have turned to dust, how shall we be raised again?
Indeed we and our fathers had been promised this before. It is nothing but the earlier people's lore."
Say: "Travel in the land and see how (bad) was the end of sinners."
Do not grieve over them, and do not be distressed by what they contrive.
Yet they say: "When will this promise come to pass? (Tell Us) if you speak the truth."
Say: "Perhaps some of what you wish to hasten is right behind you."
Verily your Lord is gracious to men, though most men are ungrateful.
Verily your Lord knows what lies hidden in their breasts and what they disclose.
There is nothing of the hidden in the heavens and the earth that is not recorded in the luminous Book.
Indeed this Qur'an explains to the children of Israel much of what they are at variance.
It is a guidance and grace for those who believe.
Surely your Lord in His wisdom will decide between them. He is all-mighty and all-knowing.
So you place your trust in God. Certainly you stand on positive truth.
You cannot make the dead to listen, or the deaf to hear the call, when they have turned their backs,
Nor can you lead the blind when they have gone astray.
You can make none hear except those who believe in Our signs and have come to peace and submission.
When the sentence will have been passed against them, We shall bring forth beastly brutes from the earth who will torment them, for men certainly do not believe Our signs.
The day We shall gather from every community a section of those who denied Our signs, and they will be brought (in separate groups),
So that when they come (before the Lord) He will say: "Did you deny My signs without having understood them?
Or what was it that you were doing?"
When the sentence will have been passed upon them for their wickedness, they will not be able to say a word.
Do they not see that We made the night for them to rest, the day to make things clear?
Indeed there are signs in this for people who believe.
The day the trumpet blast is sounded whoever is in the heavens and the earth will be terrified, save those whom God please, and all will appear before Him in abjectness.
You will see the mountains and think they are firmly planted, but they will pass away like flying clouds: Artistry of God who perfected everything.
He is indeed fully aware of what you do.
Whoever comes with good (deeds) will receive better than (what he had done), and be safe that day from terror.
But whosoever comes with evil will be flung face forward into the Fire. Can you expect reward for any thing but what you do?
(Say): "I am commanded to worship the Lord of this land He has blessed, to whom all things belong; and I am commanded to be one of those who submit,
And to recite the Qur'an."
Whoever comes to guidance does so for himself; as for him who stays astray, tell him: "I am only a warner."
Say: "All praise be to God. He will show you His signs, and you will recognise them.
Your Lord is not heedless of what you do."
TA SIN MIM.
These are the verses of the illuminating Book.
We narrate to you from the history of Moses and Pharaoh in all verity, for those who believe.
The Pharaoh had become high and mighty in the land, and divided the people into different classes, and impoverished one class, slaying its males and sparing its women, for he was indeed a tyrant.
We wished to favour those who were weak in the land and make them leaders and heirs,
And establish them in the country; and to make the Pharaoh, Haman and their hordes beware of what they feared from them.
So We conveyed to the mother of Moses: "Suckle him. If you are afraid for him, cast him in the river without any fear or regret, for We shall restore him to you, and make him an apostle."
Then he was picked up by the family of Pharaoh (unaware) that he would become their enemy and a cause for regret. Surely the Pharaoh, Haman and their hordes were habitual sinners.
The Pharaoh's wife said: "He will be a comfort to me and to you.
Do not kill him.
He may well be of some advantage to us, or we may adopt him as a son."
They were not aware (of what the future held in store).
The mother of Moses was perturbed in the morning.
Had We not strengthened her heart to remain a believer she had almost given him away.
She told his sister: "Follow him."
So she kept an eye on him from a distance, unbeknown to them.
We made (Moses) refuse a wet nurse.
So his sister said: "Should I tell you of a household that could bring him up for you and take care of him?"
Thus We restored him to his mother that she may be tranquil and not grieve, and know that the promise of God is true, though most men do not know.
When he had grown up to full maturity, We gave him wisdom and knowledge. Thus do We recompense the doers of good.
He came to the city when the people were in a care-free mood, and saw two men quarrelling, one belonging to his community, the other to his enemies.
The man who belonged to his community appealed for help against the one who belonged to the enemies.
Moses struck him a blow with his fist and finished him off.
"This is of Satan's doing," he said.
"He is certainly an enemy and a corrupter."
"O Lord," he prayed, "I have done wrong, forgive me."
And God forgave him. Verily He is forgiving and kind.
(Moses) said: "O Lord, as You have been gracious to me I will never aid the guilty."
In the morning he came to the city, fearful and hesitant. Just then he who had asked him for help the day before called out for help (again).
"You are indeed a meddlesome fellow," Moses said to him.
Then as he was about to lay hands on the one who was their common enemy, he cried out: "O Moses, do you want to kill me as you killed that person yesterday?
You only want to be a tyrant in the land and no peacemaker."
There came a man running from the other part of the city.
"O Moses," he said, "the chiefs are deliberating to kill you.
Go away from the city. I wish you well."
So he left the city, fearful and hesitant, (and) prayed: "O Lord, deliver me from these wicked people."
Then as he turned his face to Midian, he said: "Maybe my Lord will show me the right way."
And when he came to the waters of Midian he found a crowd of people watering (their flocks), and saw two maidens holding back (their cattle).
He asked: "What is the trouble with you?"
They said: "We cannot water our flock till the shepherds have driven away theirs, and our father is a very old man."
So he watered (their flock), and moved into the shade and prayed: "My Lord, I have need of whatever good you send me."
Then one of the (maidens) came to him walking bashfully, (and) said: "My father invites you that he may repay you for having watered our flock."
So, when (Moses) came to him and told him his story, he said: "Have no fear. You have escaped from the wicked people."
Said one of the maidens: "O father, employ him. Surely the best (man) to employ is one who is strong and honest."
He said: "I would like to marry one of these two daughters of mine to you if you agree to work for me on hire for eight years.
And if you stay on for ten, it is up to you.
I do not wish to impose any hardship on you. God willing you will find me a man of honour."
(Moses) said: "This is (agreed) between you and me. Whichever term I fulfil, no injustice will be done to me.
When Moses had fulfilled the term and was journeying with his family, he noticed a fire on the side of the mountain.
"Wait here," he said to his family; "I have seen a fire. I may haply bring some news from there, or an ember that you may warm yourselves."
When he drew near, a voice called out to him from the tree on the blessed spot on the right side of the valley: "O Moses, I am verily God, the Lord of all the worlds.
Throw down your staff."
When he saw it wriggling like a serpent, he turned about and fled without turning.
"O Moses, approach," (said the Voice), "and have no fear. You will be safe.
Put your hand inside your shirt. It will come out white without a tarnish of blame; and do not be perturbed or afraid.
These are two proofs from your Lord for the Pharaoh and his nobles. They are certainly a rebellious people."
He said: "O Lord, I have killed a man of theirs, and fear they would kill me.
So send my brother Aaron with me as helper for he is more fluent than I with words, that he should affirm me, for I fear that they would call me a liar."
(And) God said: "We shall strengthen your arm with your brother, and give you power with Our signs and give you authority, so that they will not be able to harm you.
Both of you and your followers will be victorious."
But when Moses came to them with Our clear signs they said: "This is nothing but magic he has contrived, for we have not heard of this from our fathers of old."
But Moses said: "My Lord knows well who has come with guidance from Him, and for whom is the guerdon of Paradise.
But surely the wicked will not prosper."
The Pharaoh said: "O nobles, I am not aware of any other lord of yours but myself. So, O Haman, fire some clay (bricks) to build a tower for me that I may mount up (and see) the God of Moses; for I think he is a liar."
He and his soldiers had become arrogant in the land for no reason, and did not think that they have to come back to Us in the end.
So We seized him and his hordes and threw them into the sea.
Behold then how was the end of the wicked!
We made them the leaders of those who call to Hell; and on the Day of Judgement they will not be helped.
A curse lies upon them in this world, and on the Day of Resurrection they will be despised.
After We had destroyed the earlier generations We gave Moses the Book as evidence for mankind, and a guidance and grace, so that they may remember.
You were not there on the western side (of Mount Sinai) when We gave the commandments to Moses, nor were you witness (to the event).
We raised (many more) generations and prolonged their lives.
You did not live with the people of Midian, nor recited to them Our revelations; but We kept on sending messengers.
You were not present on the side of Mount Sinai when We called.
And all this (knowledge that you are given) is by the grace of your Lord so that you may warn a people to whom no admonisher had come before you, that they may take heed;
And in case disaster comes upon them for what they have done themselves, they should say: "O Lord, why did You not send an apostle to us that we should have followed Your commands, and been with those who are believers;"
But when the truth came to them from Us, they said: "Why is he not given the like of what was given to Moses?"
Did they not disbelieve before in what was given to Moses?
They said: "Both are imposters one like the other," and added: "We do not believe in either."
Say: "Then bring a Book from God which gives better guidance than these so that I may follow it, if you speak the truth."
Then, if they cannot give you an answer, know that they are only following their lusts.
And who can be farther astray than he who follows his lust without any guidance from God?
And certainly God does not guide an unjust people.
We have been sending word to them that they may take a warning.
Those to whom We gave the Book before this do believe in it;
And when it is read out to them, say: "We believe in it.
It's the truth from our Lord. We had committed ourselves before it came."
These will be given their recompense twice, for they persevered and repelled evil with good, and spent of what We had given them.
When they hear idle talk they turn aside and say: "To us our actions, to you yours.
Peace on you; we do not look for the ignorant."
You cannot guide any one you like: God guides whosoever He please. He knows best who will come to guidance.
They say: "If we followed your guidance we would be driven from the land by force."
Have We not set up a sanctuary for them, to which is brought a wealth of everything as provision from Us?
But most of them do not understand.
How many habitations that had come to boast of their resources have We destroyed?
These their dwellings were never inhabited except rarely after them; and they came back to Us.
But your Lord does not destroy habitations without having sent an apostle to their metropolis to read out Our commandments to them. We would never have destroyed cities if their inhabitants were not given to wickedness.
Whatsoever has been given you is the stuff this life is made of, and only its embellishment. What is with your Lord is better and abiding.
Will you not understand?
Can one who was given a better promise, which he will find come true, be like him who was given a little enjoyment of this life, but who will afterwards be brought (to judgement) on the Day of Resurrection?
That day God will call them and ask: "Where are they you imagined were My compeers?"
Those against whom the sentence is justified will say: "O Lord, these are those we had led astray as we had ourselves gone astray.
We clear ourselves before You: They never worshipped us."
(The sinners) will be told: "Invoke your partners."
They will call on them, but they will not answer; and they will see the torment (and wish) if only they had come to guidance.
(God) will ask them on that day: "What answer did you give the apostles?"
Then all news will be blacked out for them, and they will not even ask one another.
But he who repents and believes and does good things may well be among the successful.
Your Lord creates what He wills and chooses.
The good is not for them to choose.
Too holy and high is God for what they associate with Him.
Your Lord well knows what they hide in their breasts and what they disclose.
He is God. There is no god but He.
His alone is praise first and last, and His the judgement, and to Him will you be brought back in the end.
Say: "Just think, if God were to cover you up with night for ever until the Day of Doom, what other god apart from God will give you light?
Why do you not pay heed?"
Say: "Just think. If God were to make the day perpetual till the Day of Resurrection, what other god but God would bring you night for rest?
Why do you not reflect?
Yet in His benevolence He made you night and day that you may rest and seek His bounty during them, and haply maybe grateful."
Upon a day He will call them and ask: "Where are they you imagined were My compeers?"
And We shall single out one witness from each community and say: "Bring your proof."
Then will they know that God's is the judgement, and what they contrived will avail them not in the least.
Verily Qarun was of Moses' people, but he began to oppress them.
We had given him treasures, so many that a team of wrestlers could hardly lift their keys.
His people said to him: "Do not be exultant. God does not like those who exult.
So seek the abode of the Hereafter through what God has given you, and do not forget your part in this world. Do good to others as God has done good to you, and do not try to spread corruption in the land.
He said: "This has come to me through my own acumen."
Did he not know that God had destroyed many generations before him who possessed far more acumen than he, and more wealth?
The sinners will not be asked about their sins.
Then he came before his people in all pomp; and those enamoured of this world, said: "Ah would that we had what Qarun has been given!
He indeed possesses great good fortune."
But those who knew better, said: "Alack-a-day! God's guerdon is better for those who believe and do the right.
So We opened up the earth and sunk him and his mansion. There was not a body that could help him against (the will) of God, nor was he able to save himself.
Those who were envious of his position only yesterday said on the morrow: "Indeed God increases the fortunes of those of His creatures as He will, and decreases.
Had God not been gracious to us He could have (opened up) the earth and made it swallow us.
Surely the infidels will not succeed."
We shall give the mansion of the Hereafter to those who do not want to be haughty in the land and spread corruption.
The future belongs to those who take heed for themselves and follow the straight path.
Whoever does good will receive better than what he has done; and whoever does ill shall be requited but to the extent of what he does.
He who has assigned (the propagation) of the Qur'an to you will bring you back to the destination.
Say: "My Lord knows who has come to guidance, and who is clearly in error."
You did not expect that the Book would be given to you except by the favour of your Lord. So do not be the helper of unbelievers,
Nor should you let them turn you away from the commandments of God once they have been delivered to you; and call them to your Lord, and do not be an idolater,
And do not call on any other god apart from God.
There is no god but He.
All things will perish save His magnificence.
His is the judgement, and to Him will you be brought back in the end.
ALIF LAM MIM.
Do men think they will get away by saying: "We believe," and will not be tried?
We had tried those who were before them so that God knew who spoke the truth, and who were liars.
Do those who do evil think that they will get the better of Us?
How bad is the judgement that they make!
He who hopes to meet God (should know) that God's appointed time will surely come.
He is all-hearing and all-knowing.
He who strives does so for himself. Verily God is independent of the creatures of the world.
We shall pardon the sinful deeds of those who believe and do the right, and give them a reward better than their deeds.
We have enjoined on man to be good to his parents; but if they try to make you associate with Me that of which you have no knowledge, then do not obey them.
You have to come back to Us, when I will tell you what you used to do.
We shall admit those who believe and do the right among the righteous.
There are among men those who say: "We believe in God;" yet if they happen to suffer in the cause of God they take oppression by men as punishment from God.
And if help comes to them from your Lord, they say: "We were with you."
Does not God know what is hidden in the hearts of men?
God will surely know the believers and know the hypocrites.
Those who deny say to those who affirm: "Follow our way; we shall carry the burden of your sins."
But they cannot carry the burden of their sins in the least.
They are liars indeed.
They will carry their own loads and other loads besides their own; and will surely be questioned on the Day of Resurrection about what they contrived.
We sent Noah to his people, and he lived with them a thousand years minus fifty.
Then they were caught by the deluge for they were evil.
But We saved him and those with him in the ark, and made it a sign for the creatures of the world.
And (remember) Abraham who said to his people: "Worship God and be obedient to Him.
This is better for you if you understand.
You worship idols in place of God and invent lies.
Surely those you worship other than God have no power over your means of livelihood.
So seek your sustenance from God, and worship Him and give Him thanks.
To Him will you be brought back in the end.
But if you deny, then many a people have denied before you.
The duty of the apostle is to convey the message clearly."
Do they not see how God originates creation, then reverts it back?
This is indeed how inevitably the law of God works;
Say: "Travel on the earth and see how He originated creation.
Then (you will know) how God will raise the last raising (of the dead).
Surely God has power over everything,
Punish whom He will, and have mercy on whom He please. And to Him will you be brought back in the end.
Escape Him you cannot either in the earth or in the sky; and you have no friend or helper apart from God.
Those who deny the signs of God and the meeting with Him, cannot have hope of My mercy.
There is a painful punishment for them.
The people (of Abraham) had no answer except: "Kill him or burn him;" but God saved him from the fire.
There are lessons in this for those who believe.
He said: "You have taken to idols through mutual affection in this life, in place of God, but on the Day of Resurrection you will disown and curse each other, and your abode will be Hell, and you will have none to help you."
Then Lot believed in him; and (Abraham) said: "I will separate myself and take refuge in my Lord. Surely He is all-mighty and all-wise."
So We bestowed on him Isaac and Jacob and gave his progeny prophethood and scripture, and rewarded him in this world, and in the next he will be among the upright.
And (remember) Lot when he said to his people: "You indulge in lecherous acts which none of the creatures had done before you.
You commit unnatural acts with men and cut off the way (of procreation), and commit obscenities in your gatherings."
The only answer his people made was: "Bring the punishment of God, if you are truthful."
"O Lord, help me against the wicked people,"(Lot) prayed.
When Our messengers came to Abraham with good news, they said: "We have to destroy this city as its inhabitants have become sinful."
He said: "Surely Lot is there." They answered: "We know who is there.
We are to save him and his family except his wife, for she is one of those who will stay behind."
So, when Our messengers came to Lot, he was worried on their account as he was unable to protect them.
They said: "Have no fear or regret. We will certainly save you and your family except your wife, for she is one of those who will stay behind.
We have to bring a scourge from the heavens on the people of this city as they are depraved."
Verily We have left a clear sign of this for people of sense to see.
He said: "O people, worship God and be ready for the Day of Resurrection. Do no evil, and create no mischief in the land."
But they denied him and were seized by an earthquake, and lay overturned in their homes in the morning.
And (remember) 'Ad and Thamud. It will be clear to you from their habitations (how they were destroyed), for Satan had made their deeds look attractive to them, and turned them away from the path; and yet they were a people of acumen.
(Remember) Qarun, Pharaoh and Haman to whom Moses came with clear signs; but they were haughty (and oppressed) the land. Yet they could not run away from Us;
And We seized all of them for their crimes. Against some We sent a violent wind hurling stones, and some We seized with a mighty blast, and some We submerged under the earth, and some We drowned.
It was not for God to wrong them, they wronged themselves.
The semblance of those who take protectors besides God is that of the spider. She arranges a house for herself, but the flimsiest of houses is the spider's.
Verily God knows what they invoke in His place, for He is all-mighty and all-wise.
These are precepts of wisdom We offer to men, but only those who are rational understand.
God has created the heavens and the earth with reason.
Surely in this is a sign for those who believe.
Recite what has been revealed to you of this Book, and be constant in devotion.
Surely prayer keeps you away from the obscene and detestable, but the remembrance of God is greater far; and God knows what you do.
Do not argue with the people of the Book unless in a fair way, apart from those who act wrongly, and say to them: "We believe what has been sent down to us, and we believe what has been sent down to you.
Our God and your God is one, and to Him we submit."
That is how We have revealed this Book to you and those to whom We have sent down the Book will believe in it.
Only those who are infidels will deny it.
You did not read any Scripture before this, nor wrote one with your right hand, or else these dissemblers would have found a cause to doubt it.
In fact, in the minds of those who have intelligence these are clear signs.
No one denies Our revelations except those who are unjust.
For they say: "How Is it no signs were sent down to him from his Lord?"
Say: "The signs are with God. I am only a warner, plain and simple."
Is it not sufficient for them that We have revealed the Book to you which is read out to them?
It is indeed a grace and reminder for people who believe.
Say: "God is sufficient as witness between me and you."
He knows what is in the heavens and the earth.
It is those who believe in falsehood and disbelieve in God who will perish.
They want you to hasten the punishment: But for a time already determined the punishment would have come upon them. It will come upon them all too suddenly, and they will be caught unawares.
They want you to hasten the punishment: Hell will indeed surround the unbelievers.
The day the punishment comes upon them from above and underneath their feet, (God will) say: "And now taste of what you had done."
O My creatures who believe, surely My earth has plenty of scope and so worship only Me.
Every soul has to know the taste of death. You will then be sent back to Us.
We shall admit those who believe and do the right to empyreal gardens with rivers rippling by, where they will abide for ever.
How excellent the guerdon of those who toil,
Who persevere and place their trust in their Lord.
How many living things there are on the earth that do not Store their food; God provides them as well as you.
He is all-hearing and all-knowing.
If you ask them: "Who created the heavens and the earth, and who set the sun and the moon to work?" They will answer: "God."
Why then do they vacillate?
God increases the means of those of His creatures as He please, or limits them for whomsoever He will.
He is certainly cognisant of everything.
If you ask them: "Who sends down rain from the sky and quickens the earth when it is dead?" They will answer: "God."
Say: "All praise be to God."
But most of them do not understand.
The life of this world is only a sport and play. It is surely the home of the Hereafter that will indeed be life extended and new, if only they knew!
When they board a ship they call on God, placing their faith wholly in Him.
But when He brings them safely back to shore, they begin to associate others with Him,
And deny what We had given them, in order to go on enjoying themselves.
They will come to know soon.
Do they not see that We have given them a safe sanctuary, while all around them men are being despoiled?
Do they then believe what is false, and deny the bounty of God?
Who is more unjust than he who fabricates a lie about God, or denies the truth when it has come to him?
Is there not an abode for unbelievers in Hell?
We shall guide those who strive in Our cause to the paths leading straight to Us.
Surely God is with those who do good.
ALIF LAM MIM.
The Romans have been conquered
In the neighbouring land. But having been conquered they will conquer
God's is the imperative first and last. On that day the believers will rejoice
In the help of God.
He helps whom He will; He is all-mighty, ever-merciful.
It is a promise of God; and God does not go back on His promise. Yet most men do not understand:
They only know the palpable life of this world, and are oblivious of the Hereafter.
Do they not think for themselves that God did not create the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them without reason and a determined purpose?
But many men reject the meeting with their Lord.
Have they not travelled on the earth and seen how the others before them had met their end?
They were far more powerful than them, furrowed the earth and colonised it far more than they; and their apostles came to them with visible signs.
It was surely not for God to wrong them, they wronged themselves.
Therefore evil was the end of those who did evil, for they denied the signs of God and made fun of them.
God originates creation, and then will revert it, then you will go back to Him.
The day the Resurrection comes the sinners will be overwhelmed with despair.
No intercessor will they have among those they associated (with God), and will reject their partners.
The day the Hour comes they will be separated into categories.
Those who believed and did the right will be feasted in a rich, well-watered meadow.
Those who did not believe and rejected Our signs and the meeting in the Hereafter, will be given over to punishment.
So extol God when the evening comes and the day dawns,
For His is the praise in the heavens and the earth, -- and at nightfall and the time of noon.
He brings the living from the dead, the dead from the living, and quickens the earth after it had died. So will you be brought forth (from the dead).
Among His signs is that He created you from the earth, and you are now human beings dispersed everywhere.
Another of His signs is that He created mates of your own kind of yourselves so that you may get peace of mind from them, and has put love and compassion between you.
Verily there are signs in this for those who reflect.
Among other signs of His is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the variety of your tongues and complexions.
Surely there are signs in this for those who understand.
Another of His signs is the night, a time for you to sleep, and the day to seek His bounty.
Verily there are signs in this for those who pay heed.
Another of His signs is the lightning He shows to fill you both with dread and hope, and the water He sends down from the sky which reawakens the earth that was dead.
There are indeed signs in this for those who have sense.
Another of His signs is that the heavens and the earth stay in position by His command; and then when He will call you once you will come out of the earth.
All those who are in the heavens and the earth are His, and they are all obedient to Him.
It is He who first creates and then reverts it. This is how His law works inevitably.
His semblance is of the most sublime in the heavens and the earth. He is all-mighty and all-wise.
He gives you an example from your own life: Do you possess among your dependants any partners in what We have bestowed on you, so that you and they have equal (share) in it, and that you fear them as you fear each other?
That is how We explain Our signs clearly for those who comprehend.
And yet the wicked follow their own lusts without understanding.
Who can show the way to those whom God allows to go astray?
None will they have to help them.
So keep yourself exclusively on the true way, the creational law of God according to which He created man with the quality of choosing right or wrong.
There is no altering of God's creation.
This is the supreme law.
But most men do not understand.
Turn towards Him and be dutiful to Him; be firm in devotion, and do not become an idolater,
(Or) one of those who created rifts in their order and are divided into sects, with each group exulting in what it has (carved out for itself) --
When misfortune befalls men they pray to their Lord and turn to Him; but afterwards when He has given them a taste of His benevolence a section of them begins to ascribe compeers to their Lord
So as to deny what We have given them.
Please yourselves for a time; you will come to know soon.
Have We sent down a charter to them which mentions what they associate with Him?
When We give men a taste of Our benevolence they start rejoicing in it. When misfortune befalls them as a result of what they have done themselves, they begin to despair.
Do they not see God increases or decreases the means of whosoever He please?
Verily there are signs in this for those who believe.
So, give their share to the relatives, the needy, and the wayfarers.
This is best for those who seek the way that leads to God, and they will be successful.
What you give on interest to increase (your capital) through others' wealth, does not find increase with God; yet what you give (in alms and charity) with a pure heart, seeking the way of God, will be doubled.
It is God who created you, then gave you sustenance, then He will make you die, and bring you back to life.
Is there one among those you associate with Him who can do the least of these things?
Too high and exalted is He for what they associate with Him!
Corruption has spread over land and sea from what men have done themselves that they may taste a little of what they have done: They may haply come back (to the right path).
Say: "Travel on the earth and see how came the end of those before you."
Most of them were idolaters.
So set your face towards the straight path before the day arrives from God which is irreversible.
Men will be segregated on that day.
So that he who disbelieves will bear the consequence of his unbelief; and he who does the right will straighten out the way for himself,
So that God may reward those who believed and did what was good, by His grace.
Surely He does not love unbelievers.
Among His signs are the breezes He sends as harbingers of happy news, so that He may allow you to taste of His mercy, and that ships may sail by His command, and you may seek of His bounty, and may haply be grateful.
Verily We sent many apostles before you to their people, who brought clear signs with them.
Then We retributed those who were sinful.
It is a duty incumbent on Us to help the believers.
It is God who sends the breezes that raise clouds, then spreads them over the sky as He please, fold on fold, then you see the drops of rain issue from between them.
When He sends it down to those of His creatures as He will, they are filled with joy,
Although before it came down they were despondent.
So consider the signs of His benevolence: How He quickens the earth after it had become waste.
He is verily the one who will raise the dead. He has power over everything.
If We send a (blighting) wind and they see (the earth) seared autumnal, they would surely become ungrateful.
You cannot make the dead to listen nor the deaf hear the call when they have turned back and retreated,
Nor can you make the blind see the way when they have gone astray.
You can make none hear except those who believe Our signs and have come to submission.
It is God who created you of weakness, then after weakness gave you strength, then after strength will give you weakness and grey hair.
Surely He makes whatever He wills.
He is all-knowing and all-powerful.
The day Resurrection is set the sinners will swear: "We did not tarry more than an hour (and cannot be guilty)." That is how they have always been deceived.
But those who were given the knowledge and belief will say: "You have tarried, according to the Book of God, as long as the Day of Resurrection, and this is the Day of Resurrection, but 'you do not know."
Their excuses will be of no avail to the sinners on that day, and they will not be allowed to beg for favour.
We have offered every kind of example here in this Qur'an to men. Even then if you bring a verse to them, those who disbelieve say: "You are nothing but a liar."
That is how God seals the hearts of those who do not know.
So have patience.
The promise of God is surely true; and let not those who do not believe make you relax (your endeavours).
ALIF LAM MIM.
These are the verses of the sagacious Book,
And a guidance and grace for those who do good,
Who are constant in devotion, pay the zakat, and are certain of the Hereafter.
They are on guidance from their Lord, and will prosper.
But among men are also those who spread frivolous stories to mislead (others) from the way of God, without any knowledge, and take it lightly.
For such as these the nemesis will be shameful.
When Our verses are recited before them they turn away haughtily as though they did not hear them, as if a deafness had come into their ears.
So give them tidings of a shameful punishment.
Surely for those who believe and do the right are pleasure gardens.
They will abide in them for ever.
The promise of God is true; and He is all-mighty and all-wise.
He created the skies without a support, as you can see, and placed stabilisers in the earth that you may dwell at ease as it revolves; and dispersed on it all varieties of creatures, and He sent down water from the skies and grew all kinds of splendid things upon it.
Such is God's creation.
Show me now what those (they worship) beside Him have created.
Surely the evil-doers are in clear error.
We bestowed wisdom on Luqman that he may be grateful to God. Whosoever is grateful is so for his own good, and whoever is ungrateful (should remember) that God is above all concern, worthy of praise.
(Remember) when Luqman counselled his son: "O son, do not associate any one with God. To associate others with God is a grievous wrong."
We have committed man about his parents. His mother carries him in her womb in weakness and debility, weaning him in two years.
So he should be grateful to Me and his parents. To Me is the journeying back.
If they try to force you to associate with Me that of which you have no knowledge, do not obey them.
Live with them honourably in the world, but follow the way of him who turns to Me.
Your returning is to Me in the end, when I will tell you what you did.
"O my son, whatsoever it may be, even though equal to a mustard seed in weight, or within a rock or in the sky or in the earth, God will bring it forth.
Verily God is perceptive, all-aware.
O my son, fulfil your moral obligations, bid what is known to be right and forbid what is wrong, and bear with patience what befalls you.
These are indeed acts of courage and resolve.
Do not hold men in contempt, and do not walk with hauteur on the earth. Verily God does not like the proud and boastful.
Be moderate in your bearing, and keep your voice low. Surely the most repulsive voice is the donkey's."
Have you not seen that God has subjugated what is in the heavens and the earth to you, and bestowed His favours, external and esoteric, in abundance on you?
And yet there are men who contend about God without any knowledge or guidance or the Book enlightening.
When you ask them to follow what God has revealed, they say: "No.
We shall follow what we found our ancestors following," even though the devil were calling them to the torment of Hell!
He who turns his face to God in submission and does good, holds fast to a handle that is strong; for the resultance of things rests with God.
So do not let the unbelief of disbelievers grieve you.
They will be brought back to Us, when We shall tell them what they used to do. Whatever is in their hearts is known to God.
We let them enjoy themselves only for a while, then We shall drag them to a severe punishment.
If you ask them: "Who created the heavens and the earth?" They will surely answer: "God."
Say: "All praise be to God."
But most of them do not understand.
To God belongs what is in the heavens and the earth.
Verily He is all-sufficient, worthy of praise.
If all the trees of the earth were pens and the oceans ink, with many more oceans for replenishing them, the colloquy of God would never come to end.
He is indeed all-mighty and all-wise.
Your creation and resurrection is but like that of a single cell.
Verily He is all-hearing and all-seeing.
Do you not see that God makes the night succeed the day, the day succeed the night? And He has harnessed the sun and the moon so that each runs its appointed course.
That is so for God is the Reality, and what they invoke other than Him is illusion. Indeed God is all-high and supreme.
Do you not see that the ships sail in the ocean by the grace of God, that He may show you some of His glories.
Verily there are signs in this for those who are constant and give thanks.
When the waves overshadow them like a canopy, they pray to God with all-exclusive faith in Him. But after He has safely brought them to the shore, there are some who vacillate between doubt and belief, but no one rejects Our signs except those who are perverse and disbelieve.
O people, fear your Lord and dread the day when no father will avail a son, nor son his father.
Truly the promise of God is true.
Do not be deluded by the life of this world, and do not let the deceiver draw you away from God.
Only God has the knowledge of the Hour.
He sends rain from the heavens, and knows what is in the mothers' wombs.
No one knows what he will do on the morrow; no one knows in what land he will die.
Surely God knows and is cognisant.
ALIF LAM MIM.
The revelation of this Book free of doubt and involution is from the Lord of all the worlds.
Or do they say he has fabricated it?
In fact, it is the truth from your Lord so that you may warn the people to whom no admonisher was sent before you. They may haply come to guidance.
It is God who created the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them, in six spans, then assumed all authority.
You have no protector other than Him, nor any intercessor.
Will you not be warned even then?
He regulates all affairs from high to low, then they rise to perfection step by step in a (heavenly) day whose measure is a thousand years of your reckoning.
Such is (He) the knower of the unknown and the known, the mighty and the merciful,
Who made all things He created excellent; and first fashioned man from clay,
Then made his offspring from the extract of base fluid,
Then proportioned and breathed into him of His spirit, and gave you the senses of hearing, sight and feeling.
And yet how little are the thanks you offer!
But they say: "When we have mingled with the earth, shall we be created anew?"
In fact they deny the meeting with their Lord.
Say: "The angel of death appointed over you will take away your soul, then you will be sent back to your Lord."
If only you could see when the sinners will stand before their Lord, heads hung low, (and say:) "O Lord, we have seen and heard. So send us back.
Had We intended We could have given every soul its guidance; but inevitable is My word that I will fill up Hell with men and jinns together.
So now suffer. As you forgot the meeting of this your Day of Doom, so have We forgotten you.
Now taste the everlasting punishment for your deeds.
Only they believe in Our revelations who, when they are reminded, bow in adoration, and give praise to their Lord, and do not become arrogant.
Their backs do not rest on their beds, and they pray to their Lord in fear and hope, and spend of what We have given them (in charity).
No soul knows what peace and joy lie hidden from them as reward for what they have done.
Is one who is a believer like one who is a transgressor?
No, they are not alike.
As for those who believe and do the right, there are gardens for abode as welcome for what they had done.
As for those who disobey, their abode is Hell.
Whensoever they wish to escape from it they would be dragged back into it, and told: "Taste the torment of the Fire which you used to call a lie."
But We shall make them taste the affliction of this world before the greater torment, so that they may retract.
Who is more wicked than he who is reminded of his Lord's revelations yet turns away from them; We will surely requite the sinners.
Verily We gave Moses the Book; so be not in doubt about his having received it; and We made it a guidance for the children of Israel.
When they persevered and firmly believed Our revelations We appointed learned men among them who guided them by Our command.
Surely your Lord will decide between them about what they were at variance, on the Day of Resurrection.
Did they not find guidance in the many generations We had destroyed before them, over whose dwellings they (now) walk?
There were indeed signs in this.
Will they even then not listen?
Do they not see that We drive the rain towards a land that is dry, then grow grain from it which their cattle and they themselves eat?
Will they not see even then?
Yet they say: "When will this decree come, if you speak the truth?"
Say: "Of no use will be the acceptance of belief to unbelievers on the Day of Decision, nor will they be granted respite.
Therefore turn away from them and wait as they are waiting.
O PROPHET FEAR God and do not follow the unbelievers and the hypocrites.
Follow what is revealed to you by your Lord.
Verily God is all-knowing and all-wise.
Trust in God. God is sufficient as guardian.
God has not provided two hearts in the breast of a man, nor made your wives, whom you pronounce "mothers" (in order to divorce them), your real mothers, nor has He made your adopted sons your real sons.
This is only what your lips pronounce. God says what is just, and shows the right way.
Call them by the names of their fathers.
This is the right course in the sight of God.
If you do not know their fathers, they are then your brothers in religion and your friends.
It will not be a sin if you make a mistake, unless you do so intentionally; for God is forgiving and kind.
The Prophet is closer to the faithful than they are themselves; and his wives are as their mothers.
Yet blood relations are closer to one another according to God's decree, more than (other) believers and the emigrants (who left their homes in the cause of God), but you should be kind to your friends.
This is inscribed in the Book (of decrees).
When We made the covenant with the prophets, and with you, as with Noah and Abraham, Moses and Jesus son of Mary, a binding covenant,
(It was) so that God may ask the truthful of their sincerity.
As for the infidels, He has prepared a painful punishment for them.
O you who believe, remember the favours of God to you when an army came against you and We sent a wind against them and forces that you did not see.
But God sees all that you do.
When they came upon you from above and below you, when the eyes were stupefied with horror, and hearts jumped to the throats, and you made wild suppositions about God.
The faithful were sorely tried there and were shaken completely,
When the hypocrites and those who were filled with doubt, said: "The promise of God and His Apostle was nothing but deceit."
When a section of them said: "O people of Yathrib, there is no place for you here, turn back;" and a section of them asked leave of the Prophet, saying: "Our homes lie exposed," -- while they were not exposed.
Their only intention was to run away.
If the (enemy) had entered the city from every side and asked them to rise in revolt, they would have done so, and not hesitated but a little;
Whereas earlier they had made a promise to God that they would never turn their backs; and a promise made to God is answerable.
Say: "Of no gain will be your running away if you run from death or being killed, even then you will enjoy the good things of life but only for a while."
Say: "Who will save you from God if He decide to afflict you or show you His mercy?"
They will never find a friend or helper apart from God.
Surely God knows who among you obstruct, and those who say to their brethren: "Come to us," and go to battle but seldom,
Being chary of helping you.
But when danger appears you will find them looking at you with eyes turning like a man's in the swoon of death.
Yet when the danger is past they lash you with sharp tongues, covetous of the best (of booty).
Such as these have not come to belief. So God nullifies whatever they have done.
This is how (the innate law of) God works inevitably.
They think the allied tribes have not withdrawn; and if the allied tribes had advanced they would have wished that they were rather with the Arabs of the desert asking news of you; and had they been among you they would have fought but just a little.
You have indeed a noble paradigm in the Apostle of God for him who fears God and the Day of Resurrection, and remembers God frequently.
When the faithful saw (the armies of) the allied tribes, they said: "This is what God and His Apostle had promised us; and God and His Apostle say the truth;" and this enhanced their faith and obedience.
There are men among the faithful who have been true to the covenant they had made with God; and some of them fulfilled their vows (by dying in His cause), and some still wait (prepared for death), and stand firm,
That God may recompense the truthful for their truthfulness, and punish the hypocrites or relent towards them, as He will.
God is surely forgiving and kind.
God drove the unbelievers back in their fury, and they gained no advantage.
God was sufficient (to help) the believers in the battle.
God is all-powerful and all-mighty.
He made those of the people of the Book who had helped (the tribes) descend from their forts, and filled their hearts with dread, so that you killed some and made many captive;
And He made you inherit their lands and mansions and wealth, and a country you had not traversed before, for God has power over everything.
O Prophet, say to your wives: "In case you desire the life and pomp of this world, come, I will provide you handsomely, and let you go with a grace.
But if you desire God, His Apostle, and the joys of life to come, then God has verily set apart for those of you who are good, a great reward."
O wives of the Prophet, whosoever of you commits an act of clear shamelessness, her punishment will be doubled.
This is how (the innate law of) God works inevitably.
But whoever of you is obedient to God and His Apostle, and does the right, will be given a two-fold reward by Us; and We have a rich provision in readiness for her.
O wives of the Prophet, you are not like other women.
If you are mindful of God, do not be too obliging in your speech, lest some one sick of heart should covet your person; so say only customary things.
Stay at home, and do not deck yourselves with ostentation as in the days of paganism; fulfil your devotional obligations, pay the zakat, and obey God and His Apostle.
God desires to remove impurities from you, O inmates of this house, and to cleanse and bring out the best in you.
Remember God's revelations and the wisdom that are recited in your homes. God is indeed all perceiving, well-informed.
Verily men and women who have come to submission, men and women who are believers, men and women who are devout, truthful men and truthful women, men and women with endurance, men and women who are modest, men and women who give alms, men and women who observe fasting, men and women who guard their private parts, and those men and women who remember God a great deal, for them God has forgiveness and a great reward.
No believing men and women have any choice in a matter after God and His Apostle have decided it.
Whoever disobeys God and His Apostle has clearly lost the way and gone astray.
When you said to him who had been favoured by God and was favoured by you: "Keep your wife to yourself and fear God," you were hiding something God was about to bring to light, for you had fear of men, though you should fear God more.
And when Zaid was through with her, We gave her to you in marriage, so that it may not remain a sin for the faithful (to marry) the wives of their adopted sons when they are through with them.
God's command is to be fulfilled.
There is no constraint on the Prophet in what God has decreed for him.
This has been the way of God with (apostles) who have gone before you, and God's command is a determined act.
(For) those who convey the messages of God, and fear Him and no one else, God is sufficient to keep account.
Muhammad is not the father of any man among you, but a messenger of God, and the seal of the prophets. God has knowledge of everything.
O you who believe, remember God a great deal,
And sing His praises morning and evening.
It is He who sends His blessings on you, as (do) His angels, that He may lead you out of darkness into light, for He is benevolent to the believers.
Their greeting on the day they meet Him will be: "Peace;" and He has a generous reward ready for them.
O Prophet, We have sent you as a witness and a bearer of happy tidings and an admonisher,
And to call (men) to God by His leave, and as a lamp resplendent.
Give glad tidings to the believers that there is great bounty for them from God.
Do not listen to the unbelievers and the hypocrites. Ignore what they do to hurt you, and put your trust in God.
O you who believe, when you marry believing women then divorce them before having (sexual) contact with them, you have no right to demand observance of the 'waiting period' of them.
But provide suitably for them, and let them go with honour.
We have made lawful for you, O Prophet, wives to whom you have given their dower, and God-given maids and captives you have married, and the daughters of your father's brothers and daughters of your father's sisters, and daughters of your mother's brothers and sisters, who migrated with you; and a believing woman who offers herself to the Prophet if the Prophet desires to marry her.
This is a privilege only for you and not the other believers. We know what We have ordained for them about their wives and maids they possess, so that you may be free of blame, for God is forgiving and kind.
You may defer the turn of any of your wives you like, and may take any other you desire. There is no harm if you take any of those (whose turn) you had deferred.
This would be better as it would gladden their hearts and they will not grieve, and each will be happy with what you have given her.
God knows what is in your heart, for He is all-wise and benign.
No other women are lawful for you after this except those you have married, nor to change your present wives for other women even though their beauty should appeal to you.
God is watchful of everything.
O you who believe, do not enter the houses of the Prophet for a meal without awaiting the proper time, unless asked, and enter when you are invited, and depart when you have eaten, and do not stay on talking.
This puts the Prophet to inconvenience, and he feels embarrassed before you; but God is not embarrassed in (saying) the truth.
And when you ask his wife for some thing of utility, ask for it from behind the screen.
This is for the purity of your hearts and theirs.
It does not behove you to annoy the prophet of God, or to ever marry his wives after him.
This would indeed be serious in the sight of God.
Whether you discuss a thing or conceal it, surely God has knowledge of everything.
There is no harm if they come before their fathers or their sons, or their brothers and their brothers' and sisters' sons, or their women folk or captive maids they possess.
Follow the commands of God. Verily God is witness to everything.
God and His angels shower their blessings on the Prophet.
O believers, you should also send your blessings on him, and salute him with a worthy greeting.
Those who offend God and His Prophet will be damned in this world and the next. There is a shameful punishment ready for them.
Those who slander believing men and women for what they have not done, will bear the burden of calumny and clear iniquity.
O Prophet, tell your wives and daughters, and the women of the faithful, to draw their wraps a little over them.
They will thus be recognised and no harm will come to them.
God is forgiving and kind.
If the hypocrites and perverts, and the rumour-mongers of Madinah, do not desist even now, We shall rouse you against them, so they would not be able to live but a short time in the city with you.
Accursed, they would be seized wherever found, and slain mercilessly.
Such was the law of God among those before you; and you will not find any change in the law of God.
People ask you about the Hour (of the great change).
Say: "Only God has knowledge of it. Who knows?
The Hour may be close at hand."
Verily God has cursed the infidels, and prepared a blazing fire for them.
They will live in it for ever, and will find no saviour or helper.
The day their faces would be turned on the fire (as on a spit), they will say: "Alas! If only we had obeyed God, and obeyed the Prophet."
They will say: "O our Lord, we obeyed our leaders and the elders, but they only led us astray.
O Lord, give them a double punishment, and put a grievous curse upon them."
O you who believe, do not be like those who maligned Moses, whilst God cleared him of what they alleged; and he was held in high esteem with God.
O you who believe, obey the commands of God, and say straightforward things
That He may straighten your affairs for you and forgive your sins; and he who obeys God and His Prophet will be successful.
We had offered the Trust (of divine responsibilities) to the heavens, the earth, the mountains, but they refrained from bearing the burden and were frightened of it; but man took it on himself.
He is a faithless ignoramus.
So that God punishes men and women hypocrites, the idolaters and idolatrous women, but He turns to faithful men and women in forgiveness, for God is forgiving and kind.
ALL PRAISE BE to God to whom belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth, and His the praise in the world to come. He is all-wise and all-knowing.
He knows whatever goes into the earth and whatsoever issues from it, whatsoever comes down from the sky, and whatsoever goes up to it. He is all-merciful, all-forgiving.
The unbelievers say: "There is no coming of the Hour for us."
Say: "Why not? By my Lord, the knower of the unknown, it will certainly come for you.
Not even an atom's weight in the heavens and the earth, or something smaller or greater than it, is hidden from Him, and which is not recorded in the all-too-manifest Book,
In order that He may recompense those who have believed and done the right.
For them will be forgiveness and worthy sustenance.
As for those who try to subvert Our signs, there is a punishment of painful torment.
Those who have been given knowledge realise what has been revealed by the Lord is the truth, and leads to the path of the mighty and praiseworthy (God).
The disbelievers say: "Shall we tell you of a man who prophesies that when you are reduced to particles and vanished in the dust, you will become a new creation
Has he fabricated a lie about God, or is he possessed?"
Not so; but those who believe not in the Hereafter are themselves afflicted and far astray.
Do they not see what is before them and what is behind them of the heavens and the earth?
We could cleave the earth and sink them, if We pleased, or drop a fragment of the sky upon them.
There is surely a sign in this for every penitent creature.
We favoured David with excellence, (and commanded): "O Jibal and Tair, glorify the greatness of God with him."
And We made iron pliable for him.
"Make long coats of mail," (We said), "and fix their links, and do the right.
I surely see whatsoever you do."
We (subjugated) the wind to Solomon. Its morning's journey took one month, and the evening's one month.
We made a spring of molten brass to flow for him; and many jinns laboured for him by the will of his Lord.
Anyone of them who turned from Our command was made to taste the torment of blazing fire.
They made for him whatever he wished, synagogues and statues, dishes large as water-troughs, and cauldrons firmly fixed (on ovens; and We said): "O House of David, act, and give thanks."
But few among My creatures are thankful.
When We ordained (Solomon's) death, none but the weevil, that was eating away his staff (on which he rested), pointed out to them that he was dead. When he fell down (dead) the jinns realised that if they had knowledge of the Unknown they would never have suffered demeaning labour.
There was a sign for the people of Saba in their habitations: Two gardens, on the right and left. (And they were told:) "Eat of what your Lord has given you and be thankful.
Fair is your land, and forgiving your Lord."
But they turned away. So We let loose on them the inundation of (the dyke of) al-'Arim, replacing their gardens with two other gardens which bore only bitter gourd, and tamarisks and a few sparse lote-trees.
That is how We requited them for their ingratitude. We only punish those who are ungrateful.
Between them and the cities We had blessed We placed towns along the highway, and made them stages on their journey, (saying): "Travel between them in safety by day or by night."
But they said: "O Lord, make the distance between the stages of our journeys longer;" but (by doing so) they wronged themselves. So We turned them into bygone tales, and dispersed them, scattered in all directions.
Surely there are signs in this for those who endeavour and are grateful.
Thus Iblis found his supposition about them to be true; and except for a section of believers they follow him.
He had no authority over them save for the purpose of Our knowing who believed in the world to come, and who doubted it.
For your Lord keeps a watch over everything.
Say: "Call on those you imagine are gods apart from God.
They are not masters even of an atom's weight in the heavens and the earth, nor do they have a share in them, nor is any one of them a helper (of God).
No intercession avails with Him except his He allows, so that when their hearts are freed of fear, they ask (one another): "What did your Lord say?" They will answer: "What is expedient.
He is the all-mighty and supreme."
Say: "Who gives you food from the heavens and the earth?"
Say: "God.
Surely either you or we are on guidance, or are lost in clear error."
Say: "You will not be questioned about the sins that we have committed, nor shall we be questioned about your deeds."
Say: "Our Lord will gather us together and judge between us equitably, for He is the Judge all-knowing."
Say: "Just show me those you associate with Him as compeers."
No, (you cannot), for He is God, the all-mighty and all-wise."
We have sent you only as a bearer of good tidings and admonisher for all mankind; yet most people do not understand.
Instead they say: "When is this promise going to be, if you speak the truth?"
Say: "Determined is the day of the promise, which you can neither put back nor advance an hour.''
The unbelievers say: "We do not believe in this Qur'an, nor in what was (sent) before it."
If only you could see the sinners when they are made to stand before their Lord, blaming one another!
Those who were weak will say to those who were arrogant: "But for you we would have certainly been believers."
The arrogant will say to the weak: "Did we hold you back from guidance after it had come to you? Certainly not.
In fact you were yourselves guilty."
But the weak will say to the arrogant: "Not in the least. It was your plotting night and day when you ordered us to disbelieve in God and associate compeers with Him."
When they see the punishment they will express repentance. But We shall put iron collars round the necks of infidels.
Will they be requited for anything but what they did?
We never sent an admonisher to a habitation but its well-to-do people said: "We do not believe in what you have brought."
And (further): "We have far more wealth and children (than you), and we are not the ones to be punished."
Say: "Verily my Lord increases or restricts the provision of whosoever He will;" but most men do not understand.
It is not your wealth and children that will bring you closer to Us, except those who believe and do the right. These will be given a two-fold reward for their deeds, and will dwell in peace in the high empyrean.
But those who try to subvert Our signs will be given over to punishment
Say: "Verily my Lord increases or restricts the provision of any of His creatures as He will, and repays whatsoever you spend.
He is the best of all providers."
The day He will gather all of them together, He will ask the angels: "Did they worship you?"
"God forbid!" (they will answer).
"You are our protector not they.
In fact, they worshipped the devils. Most of them believed in them."
That day you will have no power to profit or harm each other; and We shall say to the sinners: "Taste the punishment of Fire which you had denied."
When Our clear revelations are read out to them, they say: "This is only a man who wants to turn you away from what your fathers used to worship."
And they say: "This is nothing but a fabricated lie."
And those who do not believe say of the truth when it has reached them: "This is nothing but pure sorcery."
We did not give them any scripture to study, nor sent any warner before you.
Those before them had also denied, and they could not reach a tenth of (the possibilities) We had given them, and still they called My apostles liars.
How great was the change that I wrought in their condition then!
Say: "I urge upon you only one thing: Stand up for God two by two or one by one, and think and reflect!"
There is no madness about your companion. He is a warner against the dreadful affliction (that awaits).
Say: "The reward I ask is for yourself.
My reward is due from none but God; and He is witness over everything."
Say: "My Lord casts the truth: He is the knower of things unknown."
Say: "The truth has come, and falsehood had neither precedence nor will reappear."
Say: "If I am in error it is to my own loss; if I am on guidance that is so because of what my Lord reveals to me.
He is all-hearing and all-too-near."
If you could see when they are gripped by terror without any escape, and are seized from close at hand
They will say: "We believe in it."
How could they reach it from a place of no return?
They had surely denied it before and aimed without seeing from so far away.
A barrier shall be raised between them and what they desired, as was done with their partisans before.
They too were filled with disquieting doubt.
ALL PRAISE BE to God, the originator of the heavens and the earth, who appointed angels as His messengers, with wings, two, three and four.
He adds what He pleases to His creation. He has certainly power over everything.
There is none who can take away the favours He bestows on man; and there is none apart from Him to restore what He has withheld. He is all-mighty and all-wise.
O you people, remember the favours of God to you.
Is there any creator other than God who gives you food from the heavens and the earth?
There is no god but He: How then can you turn aside?
If they call you a liar, so have other messengers been denied before you. But all things will be brought back to God.
O you people, the promise of God is true. So do not let the life of this world delude you, nor let that (arch) deceiver deceive you about God.
Satan is certainly your enemy, so hold him as a foe.
He only calls his faction to be the residents of Hell.
For those who are unbelievers, there is severe punishment; but for those who believe and do the right is forgiveness and a great reward.
Can he, the evil of whose deed is made to look attractive to him so that he considers it good, (be like him who is guided)?
God leads whosoever He please astray and guides whosoever He will.
So do not waste away your self with grief for them.
God is indeed cognisant of things they do.
It is God who sends the winds that raise the clouds.
Then We drive the clouds towards the land that was dead, and restore the earth to life after it had died.
So will be the Resurrection.
Whosoever desires honour (should remember) that all honour is with God.
All good words ascend to Him, and all good deeds He exalts.
As for those who are plotting evil, there is severe punishment for them, and their plots will be fruitless.
It is God who created you from dust, then from a sperm, then formed you into pairs.
Neither does a female conceive nor gives birth without His knowledge; nor do the old grow older or become younger in years but in accordance with the law (of nature).
Indeed the law of God works inevitably.
Alike are not two bodies of water: This one is sweet and fresh and pleasant to drink, and this one brine and bitter; yet you get fresh meat to eat from both, and take out ornaments to wear.
You see how the ships churn through them so that you may seek of His bounty and, perhaps, give thanks.
He makes night run into day, the day run into night, and has harnessed the sun and the moon so that each runs to its determined course.
This is God your Lord; His is the kingdom; and those you invoke apart from Him are not masters even of the film on a date-palm stone.
You pray to them, but they do not hear your call; and even if they heard you, they could not answer your prayer; and on the Day of Resurrection they will deny your having worshipped them.
None can acquaint you (with the reality) as He who is informed of everything.
O men, it is you who stand in need of God. As for God, He is above all need, worthy of praise.
He could take you away if He pleased and bring a new creation (in your place).
This is well within the power of God.
No one who carries a burden bears another's load; and even if the burdened soul cry out for help none will carry the least of its burden, however close a relative it may be.
You can only warn those who fear their Lord in secret and fulfil their devotional obligations.
Whoever grows in goodness does so for himself. To God is the journeying back.
Equal are not the blind and those who can see,
Nor darkness and light,
Nor shade and heat of sunshine.
Equal are not the living and the dead.
Verily God makes those He will to listen; but you cannot make those hear who are in their graves.
You are only a bearer of warnings.
We have sent you with the truth, to give glad tidings and to warn. Never has there been a community to which an admonisher was not sent.
If they call you a liar, so had those before them called their apostles liars, who had come to them with clear proofs, scriptures and the splendent Book.
So We seized the unbelievers. How great was the change I wrought in their condition then!
Do you not see how God sends water from the sky, then We produce fruits from it variegated in colour; and on mountains are tracts of red and white, in different shades and raven black.
And so are among men, beasts and cattle, different shades.
Only those of His creatures fear God who have knowledge.
Verily He is all-mighty and forgiving.
Surely those who read the Book of God, are firm in devotion, and spend of what We have given them in secret or openly, can hope for a commerce that will not decline,
So that He may reward them in full, and give them a greater increase by His grace. He is verily forgiving and rewarding.
What We have revealed to you of the Book is the truth, and proves (what has been sent) before it to be true.
Verily God is informed of His creatures and sees everything.
So We made those of Our creatures whom We had chosen, heirs to the Book; but some of these exceed themselves, and some follow the middle course, and some surpass others in goodness by God's will, which is the greatest blessing.
They will enter the gardens of Eden, where they will be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls, and of silk will be their garments.
They will say: "All praise be to God who has removed all care from us.
Indeed our Lord is forgiving and rewarding,
Who has settled us by His grace in the mansions of eternal rest, where there is no labour for us, nor does weariness come upon us."
As for the unbelievers, there is the fire of Hell.
It will neither consume them wholly that they should die, nor will its torment be lessened for them.
That is how We requite the ungrateful.
There they will cry for help: "O Lord, get us out that we may do the right, and not what we used to do."
Did We not give you a long enough span of life so that he who remembered may reflect? And did not the warner come to you?
So now taste (the punishment).
The iniquitous will have none to help them.
Verily God knows the unknown of the heavens and the earth.
Indeed He knows what lies in the hearts of men.
He is the one who made you trustees on the earth.
So he who disbelieves, will bear the consequence of his unbelief. but their unbelief will only increase disgust for unbelievers in the sight of their Lord; and their unbelief will only lead the unbelievers to greater loss.
Say: "Look at the compeers you invoke apart from God.
Show me, what of the earth have they created, or what share have they in the heavens?"
Or have We given them a Book whose testimony they possess? Not in the least.
What the unbelievers have been promising one another is nothing but deceit.
Verily God holds the heavens and the earth in position lest they deviate; and if they deviated there will be none to hold them in place, apart from Him He is sagacious and forgiving.
The unbelievers swore on oath emphatically that if an admonisher came to them they would be guided better than the other communities.
But when the admonisher came to them their aversion for the truth increased,
As did their arrogance in the land, and their plotting of evil.
But their evil plots will turn back on the plotters themselves.
So can they expect any thing but what befell the earlier people?
You will not find any change in the law of God, nor will you find divine law mutable.
Have they not journeyed in the land and seen how the end of those before them, who were far more powerful, came about?
There is nothing in the heavens and the earth that can defeat (the law of) God. He is all-knowing and all-powerful.
If God were to seize men for their doings, not a living being would be left upon the earth. But He gives them respite for a time ordained.
YA SIN.
I call to witness the Qur'an, custodian of all laws, --
That you are indeed one of those sent
On a path that is straight, --
A revelation from the mighty, ever-merciful (God),
That you may warn a people whose ancestors had never been warned, who are therefore heedless.
The sentence is surely justified against most of them, for they do not believe.
We will certainly put iron collars on their heel's which will come up to their chins, so that they will not be able to raise their heads.
And We shall raise a barrier in front of them and a barrier behind them, and cover them over so that they will not be able to see.
Whether you warn them or do not warn, it is all the same; they will not believe.
You can only warn him who listens to the warning and fears Ar-Rahman secretly.
So give him good news of forgiveness and a generous reward.
It is We indeed who bring back the dead to life, and write down what they send ahead (of their deeds), and traces that they leave behind. We keep an account of all things in a lucid register.
Narrate to them the example of the people of the city when the messengers came to it.
When We sent two of them they called them liars; so We sent a third to strengthen them. "We have been sent to you," they said.
"You are only men like us," they replied; "Ar-Rahman has not sent down any thing.
You are speaking only lies."
(The messengers) said: "Our Lord knows that we have been sent to you.
Our duty is to convey the message clearly."
They rejoined: "We feel you augur ill.
If you do not desist, we shall stone you to death, and inflict a grievous punishment on you."
(The messengers) said: "The augury is within your own selves.
Do you (consider it a bad omen) that you should be warned?
You are a people guilty of excess."
Then a man came running from the other side of the city.
"O my people," he said, "follow the messengers.
Follow those who do not ask for any recompense of you, and are rightly guided.
Why should I not worship Him who brought me into being, to whom you will be brought back in the end?
Should I take other gods apart from Him, who would neither be able to intercede for me nor save me if Ar-Rahman brings me harm?
In that case I would surely be in clear error.
I believe in your Lord, so listen to me."
(But they stoned him to death.)
It was said to him: "Enter Paradise;" and he said: "If only my people knew
How my Lord has forgiven me and made me one of those who are honoured!"
We did not send down any army against his people from heaven, nor did We have to send one.
There was just one blast, and they were extinguished.
Alas for men!
No apostle ever came to them but they made fun of him.
Have they not seen how many generations have We destroyed before them who will not return again?
They will all be brought together before Us.
There is a sign in the dead earth for them which We quicken, and produce from it grain which they eat.
We have laid out gardens of dates and grapes upon it, and made springs of water flow,
So that they may eat of its fruit; yet it was not done by their hands.
Then why do they not acknowledge thanks?
All glory to Him who created pairs of everything that grows from the earth, and out of themselves, and other things they do not know.
And there is a sign in the night for them.
We strip off the day from it and they are left in darkness,
While the sun keeps revolving in its orbit.
This is the dispensation of the mighty, all-knowing (God).
We have determined the stations of the moon, so that (after its wanderings) it returns as a dried up inflorescent spike of dates.
Neither can the sun overtake the moon, nor the night outpace the day: Each of them keeps coursing in its orbit.
That We bore their progeny in the laden ark is a sign for them;
And We made similar vessels for them to ride.
We could have drowned them if We pleased, and none would have answered their cry for help, nor would they have been saved,
Unless by Our benevolence, to reap advantage for a time.
When it is said to them: "Beware of what is before you and what is past, that you may be treated with kindness;"
None of the signs of their Lord ever comes to them but they turn away from it.
When they are told: "Spend of what God has given you," the unbelievers say to those who believe: "Why should we feed those whom God should have fed if He pleased?"
You are only in palpable error.
And they say: "When will this promise come to pass, if what you say is true?"
They are only waiting for a single blast that will seize them, but they will go on contending.
Then they would not be able to make a will, or go back to their people.
When the trumpet blast is sounded they will come out of their graves and hasten to their Lord,
Saying: "Ah woe, who has roused us from our sleep?"
This is what Ar-Rahman had promised, and whose truth the apostles had affirmed.
It would be but a single blast of the trumpet, and they would all be arraigned before Us.
No soul will be wronged the least that Day, nor would be recompensed but only for what it had done.
Surely the inmates of Paradise will be engaged in pastimes.
They and their companions will recline on couches in the shade.
For them will be fruits and whatever they ask.
"Peace" shall be the greeting from the merciful Lord.
(And the guilty will be told:) "O sinners, separate yourselves this day.
Did I not commit you, O children of Adam, not to worship Satan who is your acknowledged foe,
But to serve Me; (that) this is the straight path?
But he beguiled a great many of you.
Why did you not then understand?
This is the Hell that you were promised.
Roast in it now for having disbelieved."
We shall seal their lips that day; and their hands will speak, their feet testify to what they had done.
We could take away their sight if We pleased; then they would run around to find the way: But how then would they see?
And if We pleased We could paralyse them in their tracks, and they would not be able to move forward or turn back.
Whoever reaches old age, We reverse in natural disposition.
Do they not have sense (to see)?
We have not taught (Muhammad) to versify, nor is it worthy of him.
This is nothing but a reminder and illuminating discourse,
So that he may warn him who is alive and feels, and justify the word against those who do not believe.
Do they not see the cattle among things We have fashioned by Our power, which they own,
Whom We made subservient to them so that some of them they ride and some they eat?
And they derive other advantages and drinks from them.
Even then they do not offer thanks,
And take other gods apart from God that they may perhaps give them help.
They will not be able to help them and will be brought (to Us) as their levied troops.
So be not grieved by what they say.
We certainly know what they hide and disclose.
Does not man see We created him from a drop of semen?
Even then he becomes an open contender,
And applies comparisons to Us, having forgotten his origin, and says: "Who can put life into decayed bones?"
Say: "He who created you the first time. He has knowledge of every creation,
Who gave you fire from a green tree, with which you ignite the flame."
How can He who created the heavens and the earth not be able to create others like them?
Why not? He is the real creator all-knowing.
When He wills a thing He has only to say: "Be," and it is.
So all glory to Him who holds all power over everything, to whom you will go back in the end.
I CALL TO witness those who stand arrayed in rows,
And those who restrain by reprimanding,
And those who recite the Reminder,
Verily your God is One,
The Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them, and the Lord of the Easts.
He decked the nearest heavens with ornaments of stars,
Protecting them against every wayward devil,
So that they are not able to listen to the angels of higher (echelons), and are pelted from all sides
And kept far away. There is perpetual punishment for them,
Except those who eavesdrop and are pursued by a shooting flame.
So ask them if they are more difficult to create, or the rest We have created?
Indeed (man) We created from fermented clay.
Yet while you are filled with wonder, they just scoff;
And when they are warned they pay no heed.
When they see a sign, they laugh at it,
And say: "This is only magic.
When we are dead and turned to dust and bones, how can we be raised again,
And our fathers too?"
You say: "Yes; and you will be lowly made."
There will only be a single jerk, and they will gape,
And say: "Ah woe!
This is the Day of Reckoning."
"(Yes,) this is the Day of Judgement you had called a lie."
Gather all the wicked together and their comrades, and those they had worshipped
Other than God," (the angels will be told), "then show them the way to Hell,
And detain them, for they will be questioned."
"What is the matter with you that you do not help each other?"
They will submit to questioning then,
And some of them will confront the others,
Saying: "It were you who imposed yourselves upon us."
They will say: "No, you were the ones who would not believe.
We had no power over you. In fact, you were a people rebellious.
The sentence of our Lord has come true for us.
We have certainly to taste (the punishment),
For we had led you astray. In fact we ourselves were astray."
So, they will become partners in punishment.
That is how We deal with sinners.
They were those who, when it was said to them, "There is no god but God," behaved with insolence,
And said: "Should we abandon our gods for the sake of an insane poet?"
Not in the least. He has brought the truth and confirmed the other messengers.
You will indeed taste a painful punishment,
And be rewarded but only for what you had done,
Except the chosen creatures of God,
Whose provision is predetermined --
Fruits of every kind, and they will be honoured
In gardens of delight,
(Sitting) on couches, face to face,
With cups from a flowing stream being passed around,
Clear, delicious to drink,
Neither dulling the senses nor intoxicating,
And with them maidens of modest look and large lustrous eyes,
Like sheltered eggs in a nest.
Then one turned to the other in an enquiry.
Said one of the speakers: "I had a friend
Who used to say: 'Are you one of those who can testify to the truth?
(Do you think) we would be paid back our due when we are dead and reduced to dust and bones?'
He said: 'Will you look down?'
He looked down and saw (his friend) in the midst of Hell.
'By God', he said, 'you had almost ruined me.
Had it not been for the grace of my Lord I too would have been there (in Hell).
(Another will say:)"Is it true, we are not going to die
Other than our first death, and we shall not be punished?
This will indeed be great happiness.
For this the toilers should strive."
Is this better or the tree of Zaqqum
Which We have reserved as punishment for evil-doers?
It is a tree that grows at the bottom of Hell.
Its spathes are like the prickly pear.
They will eat and fill their bellies with it,
Washing it down with boiling water.
Then to Hell they will surely be returned.
They had found their fathers astray,
Yet they hasten to follow in their footsteps.
So had many an earlier people gone astray,
And We had sent admonishers to them.
Look, then how was the end of those who had been warned,
Other than the chosen creatures of God.
Noah had verily called to Us. And how gracious was He who answered (him).
We saved him and his family from the great affliction,
And made his progeny survive,
And left (his name) for posterity.
Peace on Noah among all men.
That is how We reward those who do good.
Surely he was among Our faithful creatures.
Afterwards We drowned the others.
And Abraham indeed was of his inducement,
When he came to his Lord with a heart compliant,
When he said to his father and his people: "What is this you worship?
Why do you solicit false gods instead of God?
What do you imagine the Lord of the worlds to be?"
Then he looked up at the stars (they worshipped),
And said: "I am sick (of what you worship)!"
But they turned their backs on him and went away.
Then he turned towards their gods and said: "Why do you not eat (of these offerings)?
What is wrong with you that you do not speak?"
Then he started striking them down with his right hand.
So the people descended upon him.
"Why do you worship these you carve yourselves," he asked,
"When God has created you and what you make?"
"Build a pyre for him and throw him into the raging fire."
So they contrived a plot against him, but We made them abject.
And he said: "I am going away to my Lord who will show me the way.
(And he prayed:) "O Lord, grant me a righteous son."
So We gave him the good news of a clement son.
When he was old enough to go about with him, he said: "O my son, I dreamt that I was sacrificing you.
Consider, what you think?"
He replied: "Father, do as you are commanded. If God pleases you will find me firm."
When they submitted to the will of God, and (Abraham) laid (his son) down prostrate on his temple,
We called out: "O Abraham,
You have fulfilled your dream."
Thus do We reward the good.
That was indeed a trying test.
So We ransomed him for a great sacrifice,
And left (his hallowed memory) for posterity.
Peace be on Abraham.
That is how We reward those who do good.
He is truly among Our faithful creatures.
So We gave him the good news of Isaac, apostle, who is among the righteous.
And We blessed him and Isaac.
Among their descendants are some who do good, but some who wrong themselves.
We were indeed gracious to Moses and Aaron,
And saved them and their people from great distress,
And helped them, so they were victorious.
We gave them the explicit Book,
And showed them the straight path,
And left (their remembrance) for posterity.
Peace be on Moses and Aaron.
That is how We reward those who do good.
They are among Our faithful devotees.
Verily Elias is one of the apostles.
When he said to his people: "Will you not be mindful of God?
Would you call on Baal and leave the best of creators,
God, your Lord, and the Lord of your fathers?"
They denied him, and will surely be brought to punishment,
Except the chosen creatures of God.
And We left his (memory) for posterity.
Peace be on Elias.
That is how We reward those who do good.
He is truly among Our faithful devotees.
Verily Lot was one of the apostles,
Wherefore We saved him and his entire family
Except an old woman who was one of those who stayed behind.
Then We destroyed the others.
You pass by (their habitations) in the morning
Or at night.
Then how is it you do not understand?
Verily Jonah is one of the apostles.
When he fled on the laden ship,
And lots were cast (when a storm overtook them), he was rejected, (and thrown overboard).
Then he was swallowed by a large fish as he was worthy of blame.
Had he not been one of those who struggled hard,
He would have stayed in its belly till the day the dead are raised.
So We cast him, sick, on a barren shore,
And We made a gourd tree grow over him.
We sent him to a hundred thousand men or more,
And they came to believe; so We allowed them to enjoy the good things of life for an age.
Now ask them if their Lord has daughters, and they sons?
Or did We make the angels females, and they witnessed it?
Is it not a lie invented by them when they say:
"God has begotten (children)?" They are liars indeed!
Does He prefer sons to daughters?
What ails you that you judge in such a wise?
Why do you not reflect?
Or have you received some clear authority?
Then bring your scripture, if what you say is true.
They link Him with jinns by lineage, yet the jinns know they will be brought before Him.
God is too glorious for what they ascribe to Him
Except His chosen creatures who do not.
So neither you nor those you worship
Can mislead anyone away from Him,
Except one who is (destined) to burn in Hell.
"There is not one of us who does not have his appointed place," (declare the angels.)
"And we are truly those who stand in rows,
And we are those who sing hallelujas to Him."
They used to say:
If we had the account of earlier people with us,
We would have been the chosen creatures of God."
Yet now (that it has come) they refuse to believe in it; but they will come to know soon.
Our word had already been given before to Our votaries, the apostles, --
That they would be helped,
And that certainly Our armies will be victorious.
So you ignore them for a time
And wait; they will come to know soon.
Do they want to hasten Our punishment?
When it comes down on their plains, it will be an evil dawn for those who had been warned.
So turn away from them for a time
And watch; they will come to know soon.
Too glorious is your Lord, the Lord of power, for what they ascribe to Him.
So peace be on the messengers,
And all praise to God, the Lord of all the worlds.
SAD.
I CALL to witness the admonishing Qur'an.
But the unbelievers are still full of pride and hostility.
How many generations have We destroyed before them who cried (for mercy) when it was too late for escape.
They were surprised that one of them had come to them as warner; and the unbelievers said: "He is a deceiving sorcerer.
Has he turned so many gods into one deity?
This is indeed a strange thing!"
And their leading chiefs said: "Remain attached to your gods.
There is surely some motive behind it.
We never heard of it in the former faith.
It is surely a fabrication.
To him of all of us has the Reminder been sent down?"
They are still in doubt about My admonition; but they have not tasted My punishment yet!
Do they have the stores of the mercy of your Lord, the mighty and munificent?
Or is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them, theirs?
Then let them climb up the ladders (to the heavens).
They will be one more army vanquished among the many routed hordes.
Even before them the people of Noah, 'Ad, the mighty Pharoah,
And the Thamud, the people of Lot, as well as the dwellers of the Wood, had denied. These were the hordes.
Of all these there was not one who did not deny the messengers. So My retribution was justified.
They await but a single blast which will not be repeated.
Still they say: "O Lord, give us our share before the Day of Reckoning."
Bear with patience what they say, and remember Our votary David, man of strength.
He surely turned to Us in penitence.
We subjugated the chiefs (of tribes) to struggle day and night with him,
And the levied Tair. They were all obedient to him.
So We further strengthened his kingdom, and bestowed wisdom on him, and judgement in legal matters.
Have you heard of the litigants who jumped over the wall into his chamber?
When they came before David, he was frightened of them.
"Do not be afraid," they said.
"The two of us are disputing the wrong one has done the other. So judge between us with equity, and do not be unjust, and guide us to the right path.
This man here is my brother. He has ninety and nine ewes while I have only one.
He demands that I should give him my ewe, and wants to get the better of me in argument."
(David) said: "He is unjust in demanding your ewe to add to his (many) ewes.
Many partners are surely -- unjust to one another, except those who believe and do the right; but there are only a few of them."
It occurred to David that he was being tried by Us, and he begged his Lord to forgive him, and fell down in homage and repented.
So We forgave him. He has surely a high rank with Us and an excellent place of return.
"O David, We have made you trustee on the earth. So judge between men equitably, and do not follow your lust lest it should lead you astray from the way of God.
Surely for those who go astray from the way of God, is severe punishment, for having forgotten the Day of Reckoning.
We have not created the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them, all for nothing.
Only those who deny imagine so.
So for the unbelievers there is woe from the fire.
Should We equate those who do the right with those who spread corruption in the land?
Should We make those who are morally integrated equal to those who seek disintegration?
We have sent down a Book to you which is blessed, so that people may apply their minds to its revelations, and the men of wisdom may reflect.
We bestowed Solomon on David who was an excellent devotee, for he turned to God in penitence.
When they brought fleet-footed chargers in the evening to show him,
He said: "The love of horses is worthy of desire to me for the remembrance of my Lord;" and when they were out of sight, (he said):
"Bring them back to me," and he began to rub and stroke their shanks and necks.
We surely tried Solomon, and placed another body on his throne.
So he turned to God
Saying: "O Lord, forgive me, and give me such a dominion as none will merit after me. You are the great bestower."
So we subjugated the wind to his service which carried his merchandise wheresoever he wished;
And the devils -- the builders and divers of all kinds,
And many others bound in bond.
"This is Our gift," (We said to him), "so bestow freely or withhold without reckoning."
He has a high position with Us and an excellent abode.
Remember Our votary Job because he called to his Lord: "Satan has afflicted me with disease and distress."
"Go swiftly to the spring," (We said).
"This cold water is for bathing and for drinking."
We restored his family to him with others similar to them, as a blessing from Us and a reminder for men of wisdom. --
"Take a handful of herbs," (We said to him), and apply and rub them, and do not make a mistake."
We found him patient in adversity, an excellent devotee, always turning in repentance.
Remember Our votaries Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, men of power and insight.
We distinguished them for the distinct remembrance of the abode (of the Hereafter).
They are the chosen ones, the excellent in Our sight.
And remember Ishmael, Elisha and Dhu'l-Kifl. Every one of them is among the best.
This is a commemoration. Surely for those who take heed for themselves is an excellent place of return --
Gardens of Eden with gates open wide to them,
Where they will take their ease, calling for fruits in plenty, and for wine,
With companions of modest look, the same in age, by their side.
This is what is promised you for the Day of Reckoning.
This is surely Our provision never-ending.
This (for the virtuous); but for the transgressors the evil destination,
Hell, in which they will burn. How vile a resting place!
There will be boiling water for them and cold, clammy, fetid drink to taste,
And other similar torments.
Here is a multitude rushing headlong with you.
There is no welcome for them.
They will roast in the fire.
They will say: "In fact, it is you who will have no welcome.
It is you who brought this upon us.
What an evil place of rest!"
They will say: "O Lord, give him who has brought this upon us two times more the torment of Hell;"
And will add: "O what has happened to us that we do not see the men we counted among the wicked.
Did we laugh at them (for nothing), or our eyes fail to pick them out?"
This contending of the inmates of Hell will surely be real.
Say: "I am only a warner, and there is no other god but God, the one, the omnipotent,
Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them, all-mighty, all-forgiving."
Say: "This is a momentous message,
To which you pay no heed.
I had no knowledge of the higher Assembly when they discussed it among themselves.
Only this has been revealed to me that I am a distinct warner.
When your Lord said to the angels: "I am going to create a man from clay;
And when I have made him and have breathed into him of My spirit. Fall down in homage before him."
Then the angels bowed before him in a body,
Except Iblis.
He was filled with pride and turned an unbeliever.
Said (God): "O Iblis, what hindered you from adoring what I created by My own authority?
Are you too proud, or too high and mighty?"
He said: "I am better than he.
You created me from fire, and him from clay."
(God) said: "Then go hence, ostracised.
Upon you will be My damnation till the Day of Doom."
He said: "O Lord, give me respite till the day the dead rise from their graves."
(God) said: "You have the respite
Till the appointed day."
He said: "By Your authority, I will lead them astray,
Other than the chosen ones among Your creatures."
(God) said: "This is right by Me, and what I say is right.
I will fill up Hell with you together with those who follow you."
Say: "I do not ask any compensation of you for it, nor am I a specious pretender.
This is only a warning for mankind.
You will come to know its truth in time."
THE REVELATION OF this Book is from God, the mighty and all-wise.
We have revealed to you the Scripture with exactitude; so worship God with devotion all exclusive for Him.
Remember that devotion is exclusively for God.
Those who have taken protectors other than Him, say: "We worship them that they may bring us nearer to God."
Surely God will judge between them in what they are differing about.
Verily God does not show the way to an ungrateful liar.
Had God pleased to take a son, He could have chosen whom He liked from among those He has created.
Glory be to Him.
He is God, the one, the omnipotent.
He has created the heavens and the earth with precision.
He folds the day up over the night, and folds the night up over the day. He has subjugated the sun and moon, (so that) each runs its appointed course.
Is He not all-mighty and forgiving?
He created you from a single cell, then from it created its mate; arid provided eight varieties of cattle for you.
He formed you in the mother's womb, formation after formation in three (veils of) darkness.
He is God your Lord.
His is the kingdom.
There is no god other than He.
How then can you turn away?
If you are ungrateful, then remember!
God is independent of you, and He does not favour ingratitude on the part of His creatures.
If you are grateful He will be pleased with you.
For no one who carries a burden bears another's load; and your returning is to your Lord, when He will tell you what you used to do.
Surely He knows what is in the hearts.
When man is afflicted with adversity he turns to his Lord, and prays to Him.
But when He bestows His favour on him, he forgets what he prayed for before, and sets up others as compeers of God to mislead (people) from His way.
Say: "Take advantage of your denying for a while: You will be among the inmates of Hell."
Can one who prays in the watches of the night, bowing in homage or standing attentive, fearful of the life to come, and hoping for the mercy of his Lord, (be like one who does not)?
Say: "Can those who know, and those who do not know, be equal?
Only they think who are wise."
Tell them: "O my creatures who have come to belief, have fear of displeasing your Lord.
There is good for those who do good in this world, and productive is God's earth.
Only those who persevere will get their reward measureless."
Say: "I am commanded to worship God with obedience all-exclusive for Him;
And I am commanded to be the first of those who submit."
Say: "If I disobey my Lord, I fear the punishment of an evil Day."
Say: "I worship God with devotion all-exclusive for Him.
You may worship what you will apart from Him."
Say: "Surely the greatest losers will be those who will lose their own selves and their people on the Day of Resurrection."
Remember, this will be an all-too-evident loss.
Above them will be a covering of fire, below them a cloud (of flames).
With this does God warn His creatures: "O My creatures, fear Me."
There are happy tidings for those who keep away from the worship of false gods and turn to God in repentance. Give glad tidings to My creatures.
Those who listen to the Word and then follow the best it contains, are the ones who have been guided by God, and are men of wisdom.
Can he against whom the sentence of punishment has been justified (be rescued)?
Can you save him who is in the Fire?
But for those who fear displeasing their Lord there are lofty mansions built above mansions, with rivers rippling past below them: A promise of God; (and) God does not go back on His promise.
Do you not see that God sends down water from the sky, then makes it flow in rills on the earth, and brings forth corn from it which, having passed through changes of shade and colour, comes to ripen, and you see it autumnal yellow; then He reduces it to chaff.
There are indeed lessons in this for those who are wise.
Will he whose breast has been opened up to peace (not be) in luminescence from his Lord?
Alas for those whose hearts have been hardened to God's remembrance!
They wander (astray) in clear error.
God has sent down the very best discourse, the Book conformable in its juxtapositions, which makes all of those who fear their Lord, shudder. So their hearts and bodies become receptive to the remembrance of God.
This is the guidance of God with which He guides whosoever He will; but whosoever God allows to go astray has none to show him the way.
Can he who will have to shield himself against the torment of the Day of Resurrection (be the same as one at peace)?
The evil-doers will be told: "So taste what you earned."
Those before them had denied, then punishment had overtaken them is from a quarter they did not suspect.
Then God made them taste of disgrace in this life; and the torment of the life to come is greater, if they understand.
We have given examples of every kind for men in this Qur'an so that they may contemplate:
A clear discourse which expounds all things without any obliquity, so that they may take heed for themselves.
God advances the example of a man who is owned (as slave in common) by a number of men at loggerheads, and another man who is owned by only one.
Are these two alike in attribute?
God be praised; yet many of them do not know.
Verily you will die, and so will they.
Then on the Day of Resurrection you will dispute before your Lord.
Who does greater wrong than he who tells a lie against God, and denies the truth when it has come to him?
Is there no place for unbelievers in Hell?
He who brings the truth and verifies it, -- such are the people who are God-fearing.
They shall have what they wish from their Lord.
This is the recompense for the good,
That God may absolve them of their sins and reward them for the best that they had done.
Is not God sufficient for His devotee?
Still they frighten you with others apart from Him.
Whoever God allows to go astray has none to show him the way.
And none can lead him astray who has been guided by God.
Is not God all-mighty, the lord of retribution?
If you ask them, "Who created the heavens and the earth?" they will answer: "God."
Say: "Then just think.
Can those whom you worship apart from God remove the distress God is pleased to visit upon me, or withhold a blessing God is pleased to favour me with?'
Say: "God is all-sufficient for me.
The trusting place their trust in Him."
Say: "O people, act as best you can on your part, I am acting too. You will come to know in time
Who suffers the shameful punishment, and on whom falls the everlasting torment.
We have Sent down this Book to you with the truth for all mankind.
So, he who comes to guidance does so for himself, and he who goes astray does so for his own loss; on you does not lie their guardianship.
God gathers up the souls of those who die, and of those who do not die, in their sleep; then He keeps back those ordained for death, and sends the others back for an appointed term. Surely there are signs in this for those who reflect.
Have they appointed intercessors other than God?
Say: "Even though they have no power in the least, nor do they understand?"
Say: "God's is the intercession entirely; His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth; then to Him you will return."
When God alone is mentioned the hearts of those who do not believe in the life to come, are filled with resentment. But when others are mentioned apart from God, they begin to rejoice.
Say: "O God, the originator of the heavens and the earth, the knower of the unknown and the known, You alone will judge between Your creatures for things they differed about."
Even if the sinners possessed whatever is in the heavens and the earth, and as much more, they would offer it to ransom themselves from the torment of the Day of Resurrection; yet what they did not even imagine would appear to them from God;
And the evil of what they had earned would become visible to them; and what they used to mock would surround them from all sides.
When a man is in trouble, he prays to God; but when We bestow a favour on him he says: "It has come to me through my acumen."
In fact, this is an illusion, but most men do not know.
Those before them had also said so, and yet nothing of what they did availed them in the least.
Then the worst of what they had done overtook them. So will the evil deeds of those who are sinners among them recoil back on them.
Do they not know that God enhances or restricts the provision of any one He will.
Surely there are signs in this for people who believe.
Say: "O creatures of God, those of you who have acted against your own interests should not be disheartened of the mercy of God. Surely God forgives all sins.
Turn towards your Lord and obey Him before the punishment comes upon you when you will not be helped.
Follow the best of what has been revealed to you by your Lord before the punishment overtakes you suddenly and you are caught unawares,
Lest a soul should say: "Alas, I was heedless of God and only laughed;"
Or say: "If only God had guided me I would have been a man of fear and piety;"
Or say on seeing the punishment: "If I could only return I would be among the good."
Why, My revelations had come to you, but you denied them and were filled with pride, and were among the disbelievers.
If you see those who had imputed lies to God on the Day of Resurrection, black would be their faces (with disgrace).
Is there not a place in Hell for the arrogant?
God would rescue those who fear Him (and guide them) to places of safety. Neither will evil touch them nor regret.
God is the creator of all things, and He is the guarantor of all things.
He has the keys of the heavens and the earth; and those who deny the revelations of God will be losers.
Say: "O you ignorant people, do you bid me to worship someone other than God?
Surely you have been commanded, as those before you were: "If you associate (any one with God), wasted will be all your deeds, arid you will perish."
So, you should worship only God, arid be among the grateful.
They do not esteem God as is rightly due to Him.
The whole earth would be a fistful of His on the Day of Resurrection, and the heavens would be rolled up in His right hand.
Too immaculate is He and too high for what they associate with Him!
When the trumpet blast is sounded whoever is in the heavens and the earth will swoon away, except those God please.
When the blast is sounded the second time, they will stand up all expectant.
The earth will light up with the effulgence of her Lord; and the ledger (of account) will be placed (in each man's hand), and the apostles and the witnesses will be called, and judgement passed between them equitably, and no wrong will be done to them.
Each soul will be paid in full for what it had done. He is cognisant of what you do.
The unbelievers will be driven into Hell in groups till, when they reach it and its doors are opened up, its keepers will say to them: "Did not apostles of your own come to you reciting your Lord's revelations, warning you of this your day of Doom?"
They will answer: "Yes;" but the sentence of punishment was justified against the unbelievers.
"Enter the gates of Hell," they will be told, "and there abide for ever."
How grievous a destination for the haughty!
Those who were mindful of their duty to their Lord will be driven in groups to Paradise, till they reach it and its gates are opened, and its keepers say to them: "Peace be on you; you are the joyous.
So enter here to live for ever."
They will say: "All praise be to God Who has fulfilled the promise He had made to us, and bequeathed to us this land for dwelling in the garden wheresoever we like."
How excellent the recompense for those who act!
You will see the angels hover round the Throne, singing the praises of their Lord; and justice will be done between them equitably, and it would be said: "All praise to God the Lord of all the worlds."
HA MIM.
The revelation of this Book is from God the all-mighty and all-knowing,
Forgiver of trespasses, acceptor of repentance, severe of retribution, lord of power.
There is no god but He.
Towards Him is your destination.
Only the unbelievers dispute the revelations of God.
So do not let their activities in the land deceive you.
The people of Noah had denied before them, and many factions after them.
Every nation has intrigued against its apostle and afflicted him, and argued with false arguments to condemn the truth.
Then I seized them. How was then My retribution!
In this way the sentence of your Lord against the infidels that they would be the inmates of Hell, was justified.
The bearers of the Throne, and those around it, sing the praises of their Lord and believe in Him, and seek forgiveness for those who believe: "O our Lord, Your mercy and knowledge embrace everything; so forgive those who turn to You in repentance and follow Your path; and preserve them from the torment of Hell.
Admit them, O Lord, to the garden of Eden which You promised them, and those of their fathers, spouses and progeny who are upright.
You are truly all-mighty and all-wise.
Protect them from evil; and whosoever You preserve from evil on that Day shall have surely received Your mercy.
This will be the great triumph."
Those who disbelieve will certainly be told: "God's displeasure was greater than your disgust of your selves when you were called to belief and refused to believe."
They say: "O Lord, twice You made us die, and twice You made us live. We admit our sins.
Is there still a way out for us?"
This has come upon you because when God alone was invoked you disbelieved; but when partners were associated with Him, you believed.
But judgement belongs to God, the all-high and supreme.
It is He who shows you His signs, and sends you food from the heavens. Yet none takes a warning except him who turns to Him.
So call on God with exclusive obedience, howsoever the unbelievers may dislike it.
Most exalted of position, Lord of power, He directs inspiration by His command to any of His creatures as He will, to warn (men) of the Day of Meeting,
The day when they will come out (of their graves), with nothing of them hidden from God.
Whose then will be the kingdom? -- God's, the one, the omnipotent.
Each soul will be recompensed that Day for what it had earned.
There will be no depriving on that Day.
Surely God is swift at reckoning.
Warn them of the coming day inevitable, when hearts would jump to the throats, filling them with anguish.
The sinners will have neither friend nor intercessor whose (word) will be heeded.
Known to Him is the treachery of the eye, and what the breasts conceal.
God decides with justice. But those they call apart from Him can not adjudge in the least.
Verily God is all-hearing, all-perceiving.
Have they not travelled on the earth that they could see what happened to those before them?
They were greater in strength than they, and have left behind them traces on the earth.
Yet they were seized by God for their sins, and had none to protect them against God.
This was so because their apostles came with clear proofs to them, but they refused to believe. So they were seized by God.
Surely God is powerful, unrelenting in retribution.
We sent Moses with Our signs and clear authority
To Pharaoh, Haman and Qarun. But they said: "He is only a deceiving sorcerer."
And when he brought the truth to them from Us, they said: "Slay the sons of those who believe with him, and spare their women."
But the unbelievers' stratagem is bound to fail.
"Let me kill Moses," the Pharaoh said, "and let him call to his Lord.
I fear that he will change your faith and spread corruption in the land."
Moses said: "I seek refuge in my Lord and your Lord from every insolent imposter who does not believe in the Day of Reckoning."
A believer from the House of Pharaoh who had kept his faith to himself, said: "Will you kill a man because he says: 'My Lord is God,' when he has brought clear signs from his Lord to you?
If he is a liar his lie will recoil back on him; but in case he speaks the truth, then what he predicts will befall you.
Surely God does not show the way to the shameful liar.
O my people, authority is yours today being the most powerful in the land; but who will save us from the scourge of God if it fall upon us?"
"I show you," said the Pharaoh, "only what I see (is right), and guide you but to the right path."
But the man of belief said: "O my people, what I fear for you is the like of what befell the communities (of old).
Like the people of Noah, 'Ad and Thamud, and those that came after them.
God does not want to be unjust to His creatures.
O my people, what I fear for you is the day of gathering, crying and calling,
The day you will turn your backs and flee, with none to defend you against God.
Whoever God allows to go astray has none to show him the way.
Joseph had indeed come to you before with clear proofs, but you did not cease to doubt what he had brought until he died, when you said: 'God will not send a prophet after him.'
That is how God leads the waster, the sceptic astray.
Those who dispute God's revelations, with no authority having come to them, (are) greatly odious in the sight of God, and the sight of those who believe.
That is how God seals every proud and perverse heart."
The Pharaoh said: "O Haman, build me a lofty tower that I may perhaps find the means
Of reaching the tracts of heaven and look at the god of Moses, though I think that he is a liar."
Thus were the evil deeds of Pharaoh made to look attractive to him, and he was hindered from the path. So the stratagem of Pharaoh was bound to perish.
The man who believed said: "O my people, follow me; I will guide you to the right path.
O people, the life of this world is ephemeral; but enduring is the abode of the Hereafter.
Whoever does evil will be requited in accordance with it; but whoever does right, whether man or woman, and is a believer, will enter Paradise, where they will have provision in abundance.
O my people, what is wrong with me that I am calling you to preservation, while you invite me to the Fire!
You are asking me to disbelieve in God, and to associate with Him that of which I have no knowledge, yet I invite you to the all-mighty, all-forgiving.
What you are calling me to is surely not worth the calling in this world or in the next, because our returning is to God; and because the transgressors will be inmates of Hell.
You will remember what I say in time to come; I submit my case to the judgement of God. Surely God keeps an eye on His creatures."
So God preserved him from the evil they were planning; and a dreadful doom encompassed the people of Pharaoh:
Fire, to which they are exposed morning and evening.
The day the Hour is proclaimed (it will be said:) "Admit the people of Pharaoh to the severest punishment,"
As they will noisily argue in the Fire, the weaker ones will say to the arrogant: "We were your followers, so will you take over some of our share of the fire?"
The arrogant will answer: "All of us are in it.
Surely God has judged between His creatures."
Those in the Fire will say to the warders of Hell: "Ask your Lord to reduce the punishment by a day for us."
They will say: "Did not your apostles come to you with clear proofs?"
They will answer: "Indeed, they did."
"Then pray," will (the warders) say.
But the praying of unbelievers will be all in vain.
We will certainly help Our messengers and those who believe, in this world, and on the day the witnesses take their stand,
The day upon which their excuses will not benefit the evil-doers, and the condemnation and evil abode will be theirs.
Verily We showed Moses the way, and bequeathed the Book to the children of Israel,
A guidance and reminder for men of wisdom.
So persevere; the promise of God is true; and seek forgiveness for your sins, and chant the praises of your Lord evening and morning.
Verily those who argue in the matter of God's revelations, without authority having reached them, have nothing but pride in their hearts, and they will not achieve their end.
So take refuge in God: Surely He is all-hearing and all-seeing.
The creation of the heavens and the earth is indeed of greater magnitude than the creation of mankind; but most men do not understand.
The blind and the seeing are surely not alike, nor those who believe and act rightly and those who do evil.
Little do you reflect!
The Hour will certainly come; there is no mystery about it; but most men do not believe.
Your Lord has said: "Call to Me that I may answer your call.
Surely those who disdain worshipping Me will enter Hell, disgraced."
It is God who made the night for you to rest, the day to make things visible.
Indeed God is gracious to men, but most men are not grateful.
He is God your Lord, creator of everything.
There is no god but He.
How then do you turn away (from Him)?
Only they are turned away thus who deny the signs of God.
It is God who made the earth a dwelling for you, and the sky a vaulted roof, who fashioned you and gave you excellent form and provided you with clean and wholesome things.
He is God, your Lord.
So blessed be God, the Lord of all the worlds.
He is the living.
There is no god but He.
Therefore pray to Him with obedience all-exclusive.
Praise be to God, the Lord of all the worlds.
Say: "I am forbidden to worship those you call apart from God, since clear signs have come to me from my Lord, and I am commanded to submit to the Lord of all the worlds."
It is He who created you from dust, then a drop of semen, then the embryo; afterwards He brings you forth as a child; then you attain the age of manhood, and then reach old age. But some of you die before you reach the appointed term that you may haply understand.
It is He who gives you life and death.
When He creates a thing, He has only to say: "Be," and it is.
Have you not seen how those who dispute the signs of God are turned away?
Those who deny the Book and what We have sent down with Our apostles, will soon come to know
When, with (iron) collars and chains around their necks, they will be dragged
Through boiling water, and then burnt in the Fire.
They will then be asked: "Where are they you took as partners
Apart from God?"
They will answer: "They have left us in the lurch and fled.
In fact it was nothing that we prayed to before."
That is how God sends the unbelievers astray.
"This is so because you went about exulting wrongfully in the land," (will they be told), "and you were insolent.
So enter the gates of Hell to abide in it for ever."
How evil the abode of the arrogant!
So you persevere with patience (in your mission).
The promise of God is true.
Whether We show you some of the punishment We have promised them, or gather you up in death, they have to come back to Us.
Surely We have sent apostles before you, some of whose account We have related to you, and that of some We have not told you. But no apostle was given a miracle unless God dispensed.
But when the decree of God comes the sentence is passed with justice; and the lovers of vice and vanity will then come to grief.
It is God who made the cattle for you so that some you ride and some you eat.
There are advantages for you in them, so that you may satisfy your needs through them, and may be borne upon them and on ships.
He shows His signs. How many of God's signs will you then deny?
Have they not travelled in the land and seen how was the end of those before them who were far more numerous than they and more strong, and have left behind them traces on the earth.
And yet nothing of what they did profited them.
For when Our apostles came to them with clear proofs, they boasted and exulted at the knowledge they possessed; but what they used to mock recoiled back on them,
So that when they saw Our might, they said: "We believe in God the one and single, and reject those we associated (with Him)." --
But then their affirming served them nothing after they had seen Our torment.
This is the law of God that has prevailed among His creatures, Then the unbelievers went to rack and ruin.
HA MIM.
A revelation from the most benevolent, ever-merciful,
A Book whose verses have been distinguished and explained, a lucid discourse for people who understand,
Announcing happy news and warnings.
And yet most of them are averse and do not listen,
And say: "Our hearts are immured against what you call us to. There is a deafness in our ears, and a veil lies between us and you.
So act (your way), we are acting (ours)."
Say: "I am a man like you, (but) it is revealed to me that your God is one God, so take the straight path to Him, and ask Him to forgive your sins.
Woe to the idolaters
Who do not give a due share of their wealth for the welfare of others, and do not believe in the Hereafter.
But those who believe and do the right, will have a continuing reward.
Say: "Do you refuse to believe in Him who created the earth in two spans of time, and set up compeers to Him, the Lord of all the worlds?
He placed firm stabilisers rising above its surface, blessed it with plenty and growth, and ingrained the means of growing its food within it, sufficient for all seekers, in four spans.
Then He turned to the heavens, and it was smoke. So He said to it and the earth: "Come with willing obedience or perforce."
They said: "We come willingly."
Then He created several skies in two spans, and ingrained in each sky its function, decking the nearest heaven with lamps, and guarded it. This has been determined by the mighty and all-knowing.
If even then they turn away, tell them: "I forewarn you of a terrible punishment like the thunderbolt that fell upon the 'Ad and Thamud."
Their apostles came to them one after the other (saying): "Do not worship any one but God."
They said: "If our Lord had pleased He would have sent the angels down.
We reject what is sent with you."
So those who were 'Ad turned insolent unjustly in the land, and said: "Who is stronger than us?"
Did they not see that God who created them was greater far in power than they?
Yet they refused to believe Our signs.
So We let loose on them a violent wind for several days of distress to make them taste a most disgraceful punishment here in this world, and far more shameful will be the punishment in the Hereafter, and there will be no succour for them.
As for the (tribe of) Thamud, We tried to guide them, but they preferred blindness to guidance; then they were seized by the torment of a humiliating punishment as requital for their misdeeds;
But We saved those who believed and took heed for themselves.
The day the enemies of God will be gathered at the Fire and the records of their deeds will be distributed,
So that when they reach it their ears and eyes and persons will testify to what they did.
And they will say to their bodies: "Why did you testify against us?"
They will answer: "God, who gave all things power of articulation, made us speak.
It is He who created you the first time, and to Him you will return.
You did not hide your (doings) so that your ears or eyes or persons should not testify against you. In fact you thought that God did not know the things you used to do.
It is this notion you had of your Lord that caused your ruin, and you are lost."
Even if they are patient, their abode is Hell; and if they beg for favour, none will favour them.
We had assigned to them close companions who made their past and present look attractive to them; and the fate that had once befallen the communities of jinns and men before them was justified upon them.
They were indeed bound to perish.
The disbelievers say: "Do not listen to this Qur'an, and shout away (its reading); you may haply prevail."
We shall make the disbelievers taste the severest punishment, and retribute them for the worst that they had done.
This is the requital for God's enemies: Hell, where they will have their lasting home, as punishment for denying Our revelations.
Those who disbelieve will say: "O Lord, show us those among the jinns and men who had led us astray that we may trample them underfoot and make them wholly abject."
Surely the angels will come down to those who say, 'Our Lord is God' and then remain steadfast, saying: "You should have neither fear nor regret, but rejoice in the happy news of Paradise that has been promised you.
We are your friends in this life and in the Hereafter where you will get whatever your hearts desire, and have whatsoever you ask for,
As a gift from the forgiving, ever-merciful (God)."
Whose word is better than his who calls to God and does the right, and says: "I am of the obedient?"
Good and evil are not alike.
Repel evil with what is good. Then you will find your erstwhile enemy like a close. affectionate friend.
Only they attain it who forbear, and only a man of great good fortune can achieve it.
If the Devil incite you to evil, seek refuge in God.
He is all-hearing and all-knowing.
The night and day and the sun and moon are (only) some of His signs.
So do not bow before the sun and the moon, but bow in homage to God who created them, if you truly worship Him.
But if they become haughty (then remember) that those who are close to your Lord sing His praises night and day and do not grow weary of (doing so).
It is among His signs that the earth you see all barren and desolate begins to stir and sprout when We send down rain upon it.
Surely He who gives it life will also give life to the dead. Indeed He has power over everything.
Surely those who slander Our signs are not hidden from Us.
Then, is he better who will be cast into Hell, or he who will come out safe on the Day of Resurrection?
Do whatever you will, He sees whatsoever you do.
Those who reject the Reminder when it has come to them (should know) that it is a Book inviolate.
Falsehood cannot enter it from any side: It's a revelation from the all-wise and praiseworthy (God).
Nothing is said to you which had not been said to other apostles before you.
Surely your Lord is the lord of forgiveness, but also the lord of severe retribution.
If We had made it a discourse in an obscure tongue, they would have said: "Why were its revelations not expounded distinctly?
A foreign tongue and an Arab (audience)?"
Say: "For those who believe it is a guidance and a healing; but for those who do not believe it is a deafness in the ears, and a blindness. They are those one calls to from far away.
Verily We gave Moses the Book; but they began to differ about it.
If the Word of your Lord had not preceded it the matter would have been settled between them. They are still in doubt about it and uneasy.
Whoever does good does so for himself, and whoever does wrong bears the guilt thereof.
Your Lord does no wrong to His creatures.
He alone has knowledge of the Hour (of change): No fruit comes Out of its spathe, no female conceives or gives birth, but He has knowledge of it.
The day He will call them (and ask): "Where are the compeers (you ascribed to Me)?" They will answer: "We profess to You not one of us can vouch for them."
And those they used to worship will leave them in the lurch, and they will realise there is no escape for them.
Man never tires of praying for good; but if evil assails him he begins to despair.
If We give him a taste of Our favour after some distress he has known, he says: "It was my due. I cannot imagine the Hour will come.
And even if I go back to my Lord, there will surely still be the best for me with Him."
We shall tell those who do not believe what they used to do, and inflict on them a heavy punishment.
When We show Our favours to man he moves away and turns aside; but when in trouble he prays a great deal.
Say: "Just think. If this is from God and you deny it, who will be in greater error than he who is in open dissent?"
We will show Our signs to them in the horizons of the external world and within themselves, until it becomes clear to them that it's the truth.
Is your Lord not sufficient? He is a witness over all things.
In truth they are in doubt that they will ever face their Lord.
Do they not know that He surrounds all things?
HA MIM.
'Am Sin Qaf.
So has God, all-mighty and all-wise, been revealing to you and to others before you.
Whatever is in the heavens and the earth, belongs to Him. He is all-high and supreme.
The skies are near to bursting asunder above them (for awe of Him), and the angels sing the praises of their Lord, imploring forgiveness for the dwellers of the earth.
Is it not that God is forgiving and merciful?
Those who have taken protectors other than Him, are watched over by God. It is not for you to be their guardian.
We have, therefore, revealed to you the eloquent Qur'an that you may warn the people of the Metropolis, and those who live around it, of the Day of Gathering, of which there is no doubt, (when mankind would be assembled) some in Heaven, some in Hell.
If God had pleased He would have made them one community of belief; but He admits whom He please to His grace; yet the sinners have neither friend nor helper.
Have they taken others beside Him as protectors?
It is God who protects; it is He who gives life to the dead, for He has power over everything.
In whatever matter you disagree the ultimate judgement rests with God.
This is God, my Lord; in Him have I placed my trust, if to Him I turn.
Originator of the heavens and the earth, He has made your consorts from among you, and made pairs of cattle.
He multiplies you in this way.
There is no other like Him. He is all-hearing and all-seeing.
He holds the keys of the heavens and the earth.
He increases or decreases the provision of any one He will.
He has knowledge of everything.
He has laid down for you the (same) way of life and belief which He had commended to Noah, and which We have enjoined on you, and which We had bequeathed to Abraham, Moses and Jesus, so that they should maintain the order and not be divided among themselves.
Heavy is to idolaters what you invite them to.
God chooses whom He please for Himself, and guides to Himself whoever turns to Him.
Yet they did not differ about it until knowledge came to them, through rivalries among themselves.
If the Word of your Lord, (staying) it for a time ordained, had not preceded it, the matter would have been settled among them.
But those who came to inherit the Book after them are also in doubt and disturbed about it.
Yet to that (law) you should call them, and be constant as commanded. Do not follow their passing whims, but say: "I believe in whatever Scripture God has revealed, and I am commanded to act with equivalence among you.
God is our Lord and your Lord.
To us our actions, to you your deeds.
There is no dispute between you and us.
God will gather us all together, and to Him is our returning."
As for those who argue in the matter of God after He has been fully acknowledged, their disputing has no force with their Lord. Upon them is (God's) anger, and the punishment for them will be severe.
It is God who has sent down the Book with the truth, and the Balance.
How do you know the Hour is not near?
Only they who do not believe in it wish to hasten it; but those who believe are in fear of it, for they know it to be true.
Surely those who are in doubt about the Hour are wandering far astray.
God is gracious to His creatures, and bestows favours on whosoever He will.
He is all-powerful and all-mighty.
Whoever desires the fruits of the Hereafter, We shall add to his fruit. As for him who desires the fruits of this world, We shall give to him of these, but he will have no share in the Hereafter.
Have they other associates who have prescribed another law for them which has not been dispensed by God?
But for the decisive Word (of God) a sentence would have been passed amongst them.
Surely there is a grievous punishment for the ungodly.
You will see the evil-doers full of fear of what they deserve, yet it will come to pass.
But those who believe and do the right will be in gardens of Paradise.
They will receive what they wish from their Lord; and this will be the greatest favour.
This is the good news that God gives to His creatures who believe and do good.
Say: "I ask no recompense of you for it other than obligations of relationship."
We shall give more excellence to him who acquires excellence.
Surely God forgives and accepts (gratitude).
Do they say he has fabricated a lie about God?
He could have sealed your hearts if He pleased; but God blots out the false and vindicates the truth by His dispensations, for He knows the secrets of the hearts.
It is He who accepts repentance from His creatures and forgives their trespasses, for He knows what you do.
He answers (the prayers) of those who believe and do good, and gives them more of His bounty. But for the unbelievers there is severe punishment.
If God were to give in abundance to His creatures they would fill the earth with oppression. So He gives according to measure as He will.
It is He who sends down rain when they had despaired of it, and showers His benevolence.
He is the protector worthy of praise.
The creation of the heavens and the earth and all the living things dispersed in them, are a sign of His.
He has the power to gather them together when He will.
Whatever misfortune befalls you is a consequence of your deeds; yet He forgives much.
You cannot thwart Him on the earth, and have no friend or helper apart from Him.
Ships sailing in the ocean like ensigns are a sign of His.
He could stop the wind if He pleased, then they would be stranded on its surface. Surely there are signs in this for every one who perseveres and is grateful.
Or He could wreck them for what they have done; yet there is much that He pardons.
Let those who dispute Our signs know that there is no way of escape for them.
Whatsoever you have been given is only this life's merchandise; but what is with God is better and more lasting for those who believe and place their trust in their Lord,
Who avoid the deadly sins, immoral acts, and forgive when they are angered,
Who obey the commands of their Lord and fulfil their devotional obligations, whose affairs are settled by mutual consultation, who spend of what We have given them,
And those who defend themselves when they are wronged.
The retribution of evil is the equal of evil (done); yet those who forgive and rehabilitate will be rewarded by God.
Verily He does not like those who do wrong.
If one avenges himself after he has been wronged, there is no way of blaming him.
Blame lies on those who oppress, and terrorise the land unjustly.
For them there is painful punishment.
But he who bears with patience and forgives, surely complies with divine resolve.
He whom God leads astray has no one except God to protect him.
You should see the sinners when they face the punishment. They will say: "Isn't there a way of going back?"
You should see them brought before the Fire, abject in disgrace, looking stealthily.
And those who believe will say: "They who forfeit their souls and families on the Day of Resurrection will really be losers."
Is it not that sinners will suffer a lasting torment?
They will have no protector to help them other than God. He whom God allows to go astray has no way.
Hearken to your Lord before the Day arrives from God that will not be averted.
You will have no place of refuge then nor time for denying.
If they turn away (you are not responsible); We have not appointed you a warden over them.
Your duty is to deliver the message.
When We let man taste of Our favours he begins to exult; but if misfortune befalls him, as a consequence of his own deeds, man is surely then ungrateful.
To God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth.
He creates whatsoever He wills, bestows daughters on whosoever He will, and gives sons to whom He choose.
On some He bestows both sons and daughters, and some He leaves issueless. He is all-knowing and all-powerful.
It is not given to man that God should speak to him except by suggestion or indirectly, or send a messenger to convey by His command whatsoever He please. He is all-high and all-wise.
So have We revealed to you the Qur'an by Our command.
You did not know what the Scripture was before, nor (the laws of) faith.
And We made it a light by which We show the way to those of Our creatures as We please; and you certainly guide them to the right path,
The path of God to whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth.
And will not all things go back to God?
HA MIM.
I call to witness the lucent Book,
That We made it a distinctly lucid Qur'an that you may understand.
It is inscribed in the original Book (of Books) with Us, sublime, dispenser of (all) laws.
Should We have withdrawn the Reminder from you as you are a people who exceed the bounds?
Many a prophet had We sent to the earlier communities,
But never did a prophet come at whom they did not scoff.
So We destroyed far more powerful (nations) than they. The example of earlier people is there.
If you ask them: "Who created the heavens and the earth?" they will answer: "The Mighty and All-knowing created them,"
He who made the earth a bed for you, and laid out tracks upon it so that you may find the way;
Who sent down water in due measure from the sky, then quickened a region that was dead -- So shall We bring you forth --
He who created pairs of everything, and fashioned for you boats and beasts on which you ride,
So that when you sit astride of them and think of the bounties of your Lord, you may say: "All glory to Him who subjugated these for us. We were incapable of doing so.
Surely we have to go back to our Lord."
Yet they make some of His creatures His offspring!
Man is surely most ungrateful.
Or has He taken from those He has created daughters for Himself, and assigned sons to you?
Yet when news of (a daughter) they had reserved for Ar-Rahman comes to one of them, his face is blackened (with shame), and he grieves in silence inwardly.
Can one who has been raised on ornaments and cannot present her case coolly in a dispute (be associated with God?)
Yet they have made the angels, who are creatures of Ar-Rahman, females.
Did they witness their creation?
We shall record their testimony, and they will be interrogated.
Yet they say: "If Ar-Rahman had so pleased we would not have worshipped them."
They have no knowledge of it in the least. They only make up lies.
Did We give them a Scripture before this to which they are holding fast?
In fact they say: "We found our fathers following a certain way, and are guided by their footprints."
Thus, We never sent an admonisher to a settlement before you but the decadent among them said. "We found our fathers following this way, and we are walking in their footsteps."
"Even if I bring you a better guidance," he rejoined, "than the one you found your fathers on?"
Still they said: "We do not believe in what you have brought."
Then We punished them.
So look at the fate of those who denied.
When Abraham said to his father and his people: "I am rid of what you worship
Other than Him who created me. He will show me the right way."
This is the legacy he left to his descendants so that they may turn (to God).
In fact, I allowed them and their fathers to enjoy this life till the truth, and the apostle preaching it lucidly, came to them.
Yet when the truth had come to them, they said: "This is sorcery. We shall never believe in it."
They also said: "Why was this Qur'an not sent down to some great man of the two cities?"
Are they the ones who dispense the favour of your Lord?
It is He who apportions the means of livelihood among them in this world, and raises some in position over the others to make some others submissive.
The favours of your Lord are better than what they amass.
Had it not been that all people would become one community (of unbelievers), We might have given those who disbelieve in Ar-Rahman roofs of silver for their dwellings and (silver) stairs for mounting,
And doors (of silver) for their houses, (silver) couches for reclining,
And ornaments of gold.
But all this would have been nothing but the vanity of this world.
The Hereafter with your Lord is for those who take heed for themselves and follow the straight path.
We shall attach to him who goes blind to the remembrance of Ar-Rahman a devil as companion, --
Surely the (devils) obstruct them from the path, though they think they are rightly guided, --
Until when he comes before Us he will say (to the devil): "Would to God there was a distance of the East and West between you and me, for you were an evil companion!"
But nothing will avail you on that day, for you were unjust, and you will be partners in the punishment.
Can you make the deaf to hear, or show the blind, and those lost in clear error, the way?
We shall punish them whether We take you away,
Or show you some of what We have promised them. They are certainly well within Our power.
So hold fast to what has been revealed to you. You are truly on the right path.
It is a (source) of greatness for you and your people. You will surely be questioned about it.
Inquire of apostles We had sent before you if We appointed gods to be worshipped other than Ar-Rahman.
We sent Moses with Our signs to the Pharaoh and his nobles. He said: "I have been sent by the Lord of all the worlds."
But when he brought to them Our signs they laughed at them,
(Even though) each miracle that We showed them was greater than the other. So We seized them with chastisement so that they may turn back.
But they said: "O sorcerer, call on your Lord for us in accordance with the compact He has made with you. We shall certainly come to guidance."
Yet no sooner did We take away the affliction from them than they broke their pledge.
And the Pharaoh said to his people: "O people, is not mine the kingdom of Egypt and these rivers that flow at my feet?
Can you still not comprehend?
Am I (not) better than him who is contemptible, and cannot even express himself clearly?
Why were then no bracelets of gold shed upon him from above, or angels sent down as a retinue with him?"
Thus he made light (of the matter) to his people, and they obeyed him.
They were certainly wicked.
But when they roused Our anger We inflicted retributive punishment and drowned them all,
And made them a precedent and example for posterity.
When the example of Mary's son is quoted before them, your people cry out at it,
And say: "Are our deities better or he?"
They say this only for disputing.
Surely they are a contentious people.
(Jesus) was only a creature whom We favoured and made an example for the children of Israel.
If We pleased We could have put angels in place of you as trustees on the earth.
He is certainly the sign of the Hour (of change).
So have no doubt about it, and listen to me.
This is the straight path.
Let not Satan misdirect you.
He is your open enemy.
When Jesus came with the signs, he said: "I have come to you with authority, and to explain some thing about which you are at variance.
So fear God, and follow me.
Verily God is my Lord and your Lord; so worship Him.
This is the straight path."
But the factions differed among themselves. Woe alas to the sinners for the torment of the grievous Day!
Are they waiting (for any thing) but the Hour (of Doom) which would descend upon them suddenly, and catch them unawares?
Friends will turn into enemies on that day, except those who fear and follow the straight path.
O My creatures, there will be no fear or regret
For (those of) you on that day who believed in My revelations and submitted.
(You will) enter the garden, you and your spouses, and be glad."
Golden platters and goblets will be passed around, and everything the heart desires and pleases the eye will be there, where you will abide for ever.
This is the Paradise you will inherit (as meed) for your deeds.
You will have fruits in abundance there to eat.
The sinners will certainly dwell for ever in the torment of Hell.
It will not decrease for them; dumb with despair they will stay in it.
We did not wrong them, they wronged themselves.
They will call (to the keeper of Hell-gate): "O Malik, let your Lord decide our fate."
He will answer: "You are to stay."
We have brought to you the truth, but most of you despise the truth.
Have they settled upon a plan?
We shall also settle on one.
Or do they think We do not hear their secrecies and stealthy consultations?
In fact, Our messengers who attend them record everything.
Say: "If Ar-Rahman had a son I would have been the first of worshippers."
All too glorious is He, Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of all power, for what they ascribe to Him
Leave them to their vain discoursing and horse-play till they come to meet their promised day (of reckoning).
He is God in heaven and God on earth, and He is all-wise and all-knowing.
Blessed be He, who holds the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them. He alone has knowledge of the Hour, and to Him will you return.
Those they invoke apart from Him have no power of intercession, except those who testify to the truth and have knowledge.
If you ask them who created them, they will answer: "God."
How then can they turn away?
And (the Prophet) will say: "O Lord, these are certainly a people who do not believe."
Turn away from them and say: "Peace."
They will come to know soon.
HA MIM.
The perspicuous Book is witness
(That) We sent it down one night of blessing -- so that We could warn --
On which all affairs are sorted out and decided
As commands from Us.
It is indeed We who send (messengers),
A mercy from your Lord. Verily He is all-hearing and all-knowing,
The Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them, if you really do believe.
There is no god other than He, who gives you life and death, your Lord and the Lord of your fathers of old.
Yet they are lost in doubt and play.
So watch for the day when the sky begins to emit clear smoke,
Which would envelope mankind.
That would be a grievous affliction.
"O Lord, take away this torment from us," (they will pray); "we have come to believe."
How can a warning benefit them? The Apostle who explained all things clearly had come to them,
But they turned away from him, and said: "He is well-instructed, (but) possessed."
If We remove the torment a little, you revert back (to misdeeds).
The day that We shall seize them with a grievous hold, We will indeed castigate them.
We had tried the people of Pharaoh before them. A respected prophet had come to them (saying):
"Deliver the creatures of God to me.
I am the trusted messenger sent to you.
Do not think yourselves to be above God: I have come to you with clear authority.
I have taken refuge in my Lord and your Lord against your stoning me to death.
If you do not believe in me, leave me alone."
Then he called to his Lord: "These are a sinful people."
"Journey by night with My devotees," (it was said); "you will certainly be pursued.
(Cross and) leave the sea undisturbed.
The (pursuing) hosts will surely be drowned,"
How many gardens and fountains did they leave behind,
And fields and stately mansions,
And the comfort they enjoyed.
Thus it was; and We passed them on to another people.
Neither did the heavens weep for them, nor the earth, nor were they granted respite.
So We saved the children of Israel from degrading suffering
They (had experienced) under the Pharaoh. He was certainly a tyrant, guilty of excess.
And We exalted them over the other people knowingly,
And sent them tokens to bring out the best in them.
Even then they say:
"There is no dying for us but once; and we shall not be raised again.
So bring our ancestors back, if you are truthful."
Are they better than the people of Tubba, and those who had lived before them, whom We destroyed as they were sinners?
We have not created the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them, out of play.
We created them with definite purpose; but most of them do not understand.
The Day of Judgement is your promised day of meeting,
The day when friend will help no friend in the least, nor will they be helped,
Apart from those to whom God is kind. He is all-mighty and all-merciful.
The tree of Zaqqum will indeed be
The food of sinners.
It is like pitch. It will fume in the belly
As does boiling water.
"Seize him and drag him into the depths of Hell," (it will be said),
"Then pour over his head the torment of scalding water."
"Taste it," (they will be told). "You were indeed the mighty and noble!
This is certainly what you had denied."
Surely those who fear and follow the straight path will be in a place of peace and security
In the midst of gardens and of springs,
Dressed in brocade and shot silk, facing one another.
Just like that.
We shall pair them with companions with large black eyes.
They will call for every kind of fruit with satisfaction.
There they will not know any death apart from the first death they had died, and will be kept safe from the torment of Hell
By the beneficence of your Lord.
This will be the great success.
Therefore We have made this (Qur'an) easy in your tongue. They may haply take a warning.
So you wait. They are also waiting.
HA MIM.
The revelation of this Book is from God, the mighty and all-wise.
Indeed there are signs for believers in the heavens and the earth.
In creating you and spreading all the moving things (on earth) are signs for people firm of faith,
As there are signs in the alternation of night and day, and in rain that God sends with which He revives the earth once dead, as there are in the changing of the winds, for people who can understand.
These are revelations of God which we recite to you correctly: In what other lore but God and His manifestations would they then believe?
Alas the woe for every dissembling sinner
Who hears the revelations of God being recited to him, yet persists in denying with arrogance as though he had never heard them! So warn him of a painful punishment.
When he comes to know something of Our messages he makes fun of them: For them is shameful punishment.
There is Hell before them; and whatever they have earned will not avail them in the least, nor those whom they take as friends apart from God.
There is great chastisement for them.
This is guidance.
Those who deny the revelations of their Lord will suffer a dreadful doom.
It is God who subjugated the ocean for you so that ships may ply through it by His command, and you may seek His bounty, and may haply be grateful.
He subjugated for you whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth, each and everything.
Verily there are signs in this for those who reflect.
Tell the believers to forgive those who do not fear the visitations of God, so that He may requite the people for their deeds.
He who does good does so for himself; and he who does evil suffers the consequence thereof.
You have then to go back to your Lord.
We gave the children of Israel the Book, and the judgement and the prophethood, provided them with good things, favoured them over other people,
And gave them a clear exposition of Our laws.
And they did not differ until after knowledge came to them, through mutual jealousies.
Verily your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Judgement in what they differed about.
We have put you on the right way in the matter (of divine law). So follow it, and do not follow the wishes of those who are ignorant.
They will not avail you in the least against God.
Surely the wicked are each other's friends, but God befriends those who fear and follow the right path.
These are precepts of wisdom for men, and guidance and grace for people who believe with certainty.
Do those who seek evil think that We shall make them equal in life and death to those who believe and do good?
How bad is the judgement that they make!
God has created the heavens and the earth with reason, so that He may reward each soul in accordance with what it has done; and no wrong will be done to them.
Just think: Who apart from God can show the way to him who deifies his ego into his god, whom God allows to go astray knowingly, and seals his ears and heart, and covers over his eyes with a veil?
Why then do you not contemplate?
Yet they say: "There is nothing but the life of this world. We die and we live, and only time annihilates us."
Yet they have no knowledge of this: They only speculate.
When Our clear revelations are recited to them, their only argument is to say: "Bring our ancestors back, if what you say is true."
Say: "God, who gives you life and makes you die, will (raise the dead) then gather you (and your ancestors) together on the Day of Resurrection of which there is no doubt." And yet most men do not understand.
God's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. The day the Hour is proclaimed the liars will be losers.
You will see each community kneeling down; and each community will be summoned to its ledger (of good and evil deeds). You will receive upon that day your recompense for what you had done.
This, Our record, will speak about you truthfully.
We had everything you did recorded in it.
So, those who believed and did good things will be admitted to His favour by their Lord.
This will be a clear triumph.
As for the infidels, (it will be said): "Were not My messages read out to you?
But you behaved with self-conceit, and became a sinful people.
Whenever it was said: 'God's promise is certainly true, and there is no doubt about the Hour,' you replied: 'We know not what the Hour is. We have only a vague idea, but are not certain.'
The evil of what they had done will become clear to them, and they will be seized by what they had scorned.
"We shall ignore you today," they will be told, "as you had forgotten the meeting of this Day.
Your dwelling place is Hell, and there is none to save you:
This because you laughed at God's revelations and were taken in by the life of the world."
So they will neither be taken out of it, nor will be asked to seek God's favour on that day.
All praise be to God, Lord of the heavens, Lord of the earth, Lord of all the worlds.
His is the supremacy in the heavens and the earth; and He is the all-mighty and all-wise.
HA MIM.
The revelation of this Book is from God, the mighty and all-wise.
We have not created the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them but with a purpose for an appointed time. Yet the unbelievers turn away from the warning.
Say: "Have you thought of those you invoke apart from God?
Show me what they have created of the earth, or, do they have a share in the heavens?
Bring me an earlier Book than this, or inherited knowledge, if you are truthful."
Who is more astray than he who calls on those, apart from God, who cannot answer their prayers till the Day of Resurrection, and are even unaware of being called.
When all men are gathered together (on that Day) they will become their enemies and deny their worship.
When Our clear revelations are read out to them, the infidels say of the truth, when it has come to them: "This is pure magic."
Do they say: "He has fabricated it?"
Tell them: "If I have fabricated it, you have no power to save me from God.
He knows what you are busy with concerning this.
He is sufficient as witness between you and me; yet He is forgiving, ever-merciful."
Say: "I am not a new Messenger to come, nor do I know what is to be done to me or you.
I only follow what is revealed to me. My duty is only to warn you clearly."
Tell them: "Think (of the consequence) if this is from God and you deny it when a witness from the people of Israel had testified to the like of it and come to believe, while you spurn it?"
Assuredly God does not guide a wicked people.
Those who deny say of those who believe: "Had there been any good in it they would not have preceded us in coming to it."
Since they have not taken guidance from it, they will say: "This is the same old lie."
There was the Book of Moses before this, a guide and a mercy; and here is this Book confirming it in lucid language, warning those who are wicked, and giving happy tidings to the righteous.
Surely for those who say, "God is our Lord," and then remain firm, there is no fear or regret.
They are men of Paradise where they will abide for ever as a recompense for what they had done.
We have enjoined on man to be good to his parents: His mother carries him in her womb with hardship, and gives birth to him in pain.
Thirty months is the period of her carrying and weaning him. When he attains to manhood and the age of forty, he says: "O Lord, guide me to thank You for the favours You have bestowed on me and my parents, and to do things good as may please You, and give me a righteous off-spring.
I turn to You in penitence and submit."
They are those from whom We accept the very best of what they have done, and overlook their faults.
They will be among the inmates of Paradise: A true promise they have been made.
But he who says to his parents: "Shame on you: You intimidate me that I will be resurrected when many generations will have passed before me?" And (the parents) would implore God's help: "Woe to you.
The promise of God is certainly true." Yet he answers: "These are only fables of long ago."
They are those on whom the sentence of God would be justified as on communities of jinns and men before them.
They will surely perish.
Each will have a position in accordance with his deeds; and no wrong will be done to them.
The day the unbelievers are brought to the Fire, (it will be said): "You wasted all your good deeds in the life of the world, and enjoyed them to the full.
You will now be requited with a shameful punishment, for you behaved with arrogance for no reason on the earth, and acted wickedly."
Remember (Hud) the brother of 'Ad. When he warned his people in Ahqaf -- though many a warner had come and gone before and after him: "Do not worship any one but God, for I fear the punishment of an awful day for you,"
They said: "Have you come to turn us away from our gods?
Then bring upon us what you predict for us, if you are a man of truth."
He said: "Only God has the knowledge.
I only convey to you what I have been sent with. But I see you are a foolish people."
So when they saw it as a cloud advancing towards their valleys, they said: "This is just a passing cloud that will bring us rain."
"No. It is what you were trying to hasten: The wind which carries the grievous punishment!
It will destroy everything at the bidding of its Lord."
So in the morning there was nothing but their empty dwellings to be seen. That is how We requite the sinners.
We had strengthened them as We have not strengthened you, had given them ears and eyes and hearts; but nothing stood them in good stead, neither their ears nor eyes nor hearts, for they rejected the signs of God, and were seized by what they had mocked.
We have destroyed habitations all around you, having explained Our signs in different ways to them that they may turn back.
Why then did the gods they had taken apart from God as propitiators, not come to their aid?
In fact they strayed away from them.
It was all a lie what they had contrived!
And (remember), when We turned a company of jinns towards you to listen to the Qur'an, they arrived when it was being recited, and they said: "Keep silent." When it was over they came back to their people, warning them:
"O our people:" they said: "we have listened to a Book which has come down after Moses, confirming what was (sent down) before it, showing the way to the truth and a path that is straight.
O our people, hearken to the summoner of God, and believe in him, so that He may forgive you your sins and save you from a painful doom.
He who does not listen to the summoner of God cannot weaken (the power of) God on earth, nor will he have protectors other than Him.
They are clearly in the wrong."
Do they not realise that God who created the heavens and the earth, and did not tire creating them, is able to bring the dead to life? And why not?
He has the power over everything.
The day the unbelievers will be stood before the Fire, (they will be asked:) "Is this not the reality?"
They will answer: "In truth, by our Lord!"
It will be said: "Then taste the torment of what you had denied."
So bear with patience, as the apostles who were constant, bore; and do not be hasty (in demanding punishment) for them.
On the day they see what they had been foretold, (they will realise) that they did not stay in the world but only an hour of the day.
This is the message to be conveyed: Shall any perish but the ungodly?
THOSE WHO DISBELIEVE and obstruct (others) from the way of God will have wasted their deeds.
But those who believe and do the right, and believe what has been revealed to Muhammad, which is the truth from their Lord, will have their faults condoned by Him and their state improved.
That is because those who refuse to believe only follow what is false; but those who believe follow the truth from their Lord.
That is how God gives men precepts of wisdom.
So, when you clash with the unbelievers, smite their necks until you overpower them, then hold them in bondage.
Then either free them graciously or after taking a ransom, until war shall have come to end.
If God had pleased He could have punished them (Himself), but He wills to test some of you through some others.
He will not allow the deeds of those who are killed in the cause of God to go waste.
He will show them the way, and better their state,
And will admit them into gardens with which he has acquainted them.
O you who believe, if you help (in the cause of) God He will surely come to your aid, and firmly plant your feet.
As for the unbelievers, they will suffer misfortunes, and their deeds will be rendered ineffective.
That is so as they were averse to what has been revealed by God, and their actions will be nullified.
Have they not journeyed in the land and seen the fate of those before them?
Destroyed they were utterly by God; and a similar (fate) awaits the unbelievers.
This is so for God is the friend of those who believe while the unbelievers have no friend.
Verily God will admit those who believe and do the right into gardens with streams of water running by. But the unbelievers revel and carouse and subsist like beasts, and Hell will be their residence.
How many were the habitations, mightier than your city which has turned you out, which We destroyed; and they did not have a helper.
Can one who stands on a clear proof from his Lord, be like one enamoured of his evil deeds and follows his inane desires?
The semblance of Paradise promised the pious and devout (is that of a garden) with streams of water that will not go rank, and rivers of milk whose taste will not undergo a change, and rivers of wine delectable to drinkers, and streams of purified honey, and fruits of every kind in them, and forgiveness of their Lord.
Are these like those who will live for ever in the Fire and be given boiling water to drink which will cut their intestines to shreds?
There are some who listen to you; but as soon as they go from you they say to those who were given knowledge: "What is this he is saying now?"
They are those whose hearts have been sealed by God, and they follow their own lusts.
But those who are rightly guided will be given greater guidance by Him, and they will have their intrinsic piety.
Do they wait for any thing but the Hour (of change), that it may come upon them suddenly?
Its signs have already appeared.
How then will they be warned when it has come upon them?
Know then, therefore, there is no god but He, and ask forgiveness for your sins and those of believing men and women.
God knows your wanderings and your destination.
Those who believe say: "How is it no Surah was revealed?"
But when a categorical Surah is revealed that mentions war, you should see those who are sceptical staring at you like a man in the swoon of death. Alas the woe for them!
Obedience and modest speech (would have been more becoming). And when the matter has been determined it is best for them to be true to God.
Is it possible that if placed in authority you will create disorder in the land and sever your bonds of relationship?
They are those who were condemned by God, whose ears were blocked by Him and their eyes blinded.
Do they not ponder on what the Qur'an says? Or have their hearts been sealed with locks?
Those who turn their backs after the way of guidance has been opened to them, have been surely tempted by Satan and beguiled by illusory hopes.
This was so because they said to those who disdain what God has revealed: "We shall obey you in some things."
But God knows their secret intentions well.
How will it be when the angels draw out their souls striking their faces and their backs?
Because they followed what displeases God, and they were averse to pleasing Him.
So We nullified their deeds.
Do they whose minds are filled with doubt, think that God will not expose their malice?
Had We pleased We could have shown them to you that you could know them by their marks, and recognise them from the way they twist their words.
Yet God knows all your deeds.
We shall try you in order to know who are the fighters among you, and who are men of fortitude, and verify your histories.
Surely those who do not believe, and obstruct others from the path of God, and oppose the Prophet after the way of guidance has been opened to them, will not hurt God in the least, and He will nullify all that they have done.
O you who believe, obey God and the Prophet, and do not waste your deeds.
Those who do not believe and obstruct others from the way of God, and die disbelieving, will not be pardoned by God.
So do not become weak-kneed and sue for peace, for you will have the upper hand as God is with you and will not overlook your deeds.
Verily the life of this world is no more than a sport and frivolity. If you believe and fear God, he will give you your reward, and will not ask for your possessions.
If He asks for all you possess and insist upon it, you will become niggardly, and it will bring out your malevolence.
Beware! You are called to spend in the way of God, yet some among you close their fists.
But he who is niggardly is so for his own self: God is above need, and it is you who are needy.
If you turn away then God will bring other people in your place who, moreover, will not be like you.
WE HAVE GIVEN you a splendent victory
That God may save you from earlier and subsequent blames, and complete His favours on you, and guide you on the straight path,
And help you with surpassing help.
It is He who sent down the sense of security into the hearts of believers so that their faith may increase with belief, -- God's are the armies of the heavens and the earth; and God is all-knowing and all-wise; --
And that He may admit men and women who believe into gardens with rivers running by, to live for ever there, and absolve their evil, -- This, in the sight of God, will be the great fulfilment --
And that He may punish men and women (who are) hypocrites, and idolaters and idolatresses who entertain evil notions of God: It is against them that the wheel of misfortune will turn, and God will be wroth with them, and condemn them.
For them He has prepared Hell, an evil destination!
For God's are the armies of the heavens and the earth; and God is all-knowing and all-wise.
We have sent you as witness (of the truth) and harbinger of good news and a warner,
So that (men) may believe in God and His Apostle, and honour Him and revere Him, and sing His praises morning and evening.
Those who swear allegiance to you indeed swear allegiance to God; and God's protection is over them.
Then whosoever breaks the promise breaks it to his own loss; but whosoever fulfills the promise made to God will receive a great reward from Him.
The Arabs of the desert who had stayed behind will now say to you: "We were occupied with our flocks and herds and families, so ask forgiveness for us.
They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts.
Tell them: "Who can prevail with God for you if He wish you harm or benefit?
Surely God is well aware of what you do.
In fact you imagined that the Prophet and the faithful would never come back home; and this seemed pleasing to your hearts, and you entertained evil thoughts. You are a people lost.
He who does not believe in God and His Apostle (should know) We have prepared for unbelievers a blazing fire."
To God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth; He may forgive whosoever He please, and afflict whosoever He will. Yet God is forgiving and kind.
Those who had stayed behind will say: "When you depart for taking the spoils, allow us to follow you." They wish to change the word of God.
Tell them: "You will not follow us.
That is what God has already said before."
They will say: "You are envious of our gain."
The fact is they understand but little.
You will fight them till they surrender. If you obey, then He will give you a good reward; but if you turn back, as you had done before, He will punish you with a grievous affliction."
It is not binding on the blind, the lame or the sick (to follow this command); but those who obey God and His Apostle will be admitted by God to gardens with running streams; but those who turn back will suffer a painful doom.
God was pleased with the believers when they swore allegiance to you under the tree, for He knew well what was in their hearts, and sent down tranquility on them, and rewarded them with an expeditious victory
And the many spoils that they were to take.
God is all-mighty and all-wise.
God had promised you many spoils that you would capture; so He gave this soon enough to you, and stayed the hands of men from you that it may serve as a sign for believers, and guide you on the straight path;
And other (benefits) which you have not yet obtained, are within the compass of God, for God has power over everything.
Had the unbelievers fought you they would have turned their backs and not found a protector or helper.
This is the law of God, effective as before: You will not find any change in the law of God.
It was He who restrained their hands from you in the heart of Makkah, and your hands from them, after He had given you victory over them, as God sees all that you do.
It were those who disbelieved who hindered you from (going to) the Holy Mosque, preventing your offerings from arriving at the place of sacrifice.
Had it not been for (the presence of) believers, men and women, (among the unbelievers) of whom you were unaware, and whom you might have trampled and thus incurred guilt unknowingly on account of them, (the matter would have been settled). (But this was not done) so that God may admit into His favour whom He willed.
If these (believers) had been separated from them, He would have inflicted a grievous punishment on the unbelievers.
When the unbelievers fostered a sense of honour in their hearts, a sense of pagan honour, God sent down a sense of tranquility on His Apostle and the believers, and obliged them to an act of self-restraint, for they were deserving and worthy of it.
God is cognisant of everything.
God has truly made the vision of His Apostle come true: You will surely enter the Holy Mosque in security if God please, without any fear, having shaved your heads and cut your hair.
He knew what you did not know, and has vouchsafed you, apart from this, a victory near at hand.
It is He who has sent His Apostle with the guidance and the true faith, so that He may exalt it over every other creed.
God is sufficient as a witness.
Muhammad is the Prophet of God; and those who are with him are severe with infidels but compassionate among themselves.
You may see them kneeling and bowing in reverence, seeking His favour and acceptance.
Their mark is on their foreheads from the effect of prostrations.
Their likeness in the Torah, and their likeness in the Gospel, is like a seed that sends out a stalk, then makes it firm, and it becomes strong and rises straight upon its stem, gladdening the cultivator's heart, in order to fill the unbelievers with dismay.
God has promised those who believe and do the right forgiveness and a great reward.
O YOU WHO believe, do not forestall the judgements of God and His Apostle, and have fear of God.
Verily God hears all and knows everything.
O you who believe, do not raise your voices above the voice of the Prophet, and do not speak loudly to him as you do with one another lest your deeds are nullified unconsciously.
They who speak in a low voice in the presence of God's Apostle, have had their hearts tried by God for reverence.
There is forgiveness for them and a great reward.
Many of those who call you from outside the apartments are not considerate.
If they had waited for you to come out it would have been better for them.
But God is forgiving and kind.
O you who believe, if a dissolute person brings some news, verify it first lest you attack a people ignorantly and later regret what you had done.
Know that the Apostle of God is among you: If he agreed with you in most matters you would surely come to grief. But God has made faith more desirable to you, and attractive to your hearts, and rendered disbelief and sin and disobedience repugnant.
They are those who are well directed
By God's benevolence and His grace.
God is all-knowing and all-wise.
If two groups of believers come to fight one another, promote peace between them. Then if one of them turns aggressive against the other, fight against the aggressive party till it returns to God's authority.
If it does so, make peace among them equitably and be impartial.
Verily God loves those who are just.
The faithful are surely brothers; so restore friendship among your brothers, and fear God that you may be favoured.
O you who believe, men should not laugh at other men, for it may be they are better than them; and women should not laugh at other women, for they may perhaps be better than them.
Do not slander one another, nor give one another nick-names.
After believing, it is bad to give (another) a bad name. Those who do not repent behave wickedly.
O you who believe, avoid most suspicions: Some suspicions are indeed sins.
So do not pry into others' secrets and do not backbite.
Would any of you like to eat a dead brother's flesh?
You would surely be revolted by it Then fear God.
He is certainly forgiving and kind.
O men, We created you from a male and female, and formed you into nations and tribes that you may recognise each other.
He who has more integrity has indeed greater honour with God.
Surely God is all-knowing and well-informed.
The Arabs of the desert say: "We believe."
Tell them: "You do not believe. Better say: 'We submit'; for belief has not yet penetrated your hearts."
If you begin to obey God and His Apostle, He will not withhold the least (of the recompense) of your labour.
Verily God is forgiving and kind."
They alone are believers who come to believe in God and His Apostle, then never doubt again, and struggle wealth and soul in the way of God.
They are the truthful and sincere.
Say: "Are you trying to convince God of your faithfulness? But God knows all there is in the heavens and the earth, for God has knowledge of everything."
They impress upon you that they have submitted.
Tell them: "Do not favour me with your submission.
In fact God has favoured you by showing you the way to belief, if you are men of truth."
Verily God knows the unknown of the heavens and the earth; and God perceives all you do.
QAF. I CALL to witness the glorious Qur'an.
They are rather surprised that a warner from among themselves has come to them.
So the unbelievers say: "This is astonishing:
When we are dead and turned to dust, this returning (to life) is most far-fetched."
We know what the earth consumes of them, for We have the Book that preserves everything.
But no! They called the truth a lie when it came to them; so they are in a confused state.
Have they not looked at the sky above them, how We have fashioned and adorned it, and it has no flaw?
We stretched the earth and placed upon it firm stabilisers and We made every kind of splendid thing to grow upon it
As instruction and reminder to every penitent creature.
And We send down water as a blessing from the sky, and grow gardens with it and the grain for harvest,
And tall date-palms with their spathes pile on pile
As a provision for men, and enlivened a region that was dead.
Even thus will be the life after death.
The people of Noah, Ar-Rass and Thamud denied before you,
As did the people of 'Ad and Pharaoh and the brethren of Lot,
And the dwellers of the Wood and people of Tubba'.
Each of them denied the apostles.
So My threat became a reality.
Were We exhausted by the act of the first creation?
And yet they are confused about a new creation.
He created man and surely know what misdoubts arise in their hearts; for We are closer to him than his jugular vein.
When the two (angels) who keep the account, one sitting on the right, one on the left, take it down,
There is not a word he utters but an observer is ready (to make note of it).
The palsy of death will surely come. This is what you wished to avert.
And the trumpet blast will sound: It would be the Day of Doom.
Each soul will come with a driver and a witness.
(And the driver will say:) "You were oblivious of this, so we have removed the veil, and how keen is your sight today!"
His companion will say: "Here is (the record) I have ready with me."
"Cast each stubborn unbeliever into Hell," (they will be told),
"Every obstructor of good, transgressor, and the sceptic,
Who had set up another god with God.
Cast him into severe torment."
His companion will say: "O Lord, I did not lead him to wickedness, but he was himself far astray."
"Do not argue in My presence. I had announced the promise of doom in advance.
There is no changing of My word, nor am I unjust to My creatures."
We shall ask Hell that day: "Are you full?" It will answer: "Are there still more?"
And Paradise will be brought near, not far from those who took heed for themselves and feared God.
"This is what you had been promised," (will be said) to every penitent who remembered (his duty),
Who feared Ar-Rahman in secret, and came with a penitent heart:
"Enter it in peace.
This is the day of life abiding."
Theirs will be whatsoever they wish: And with Us there is more.
How many generations have We destroyed before them who were mightier in power than they. Then they searched throughout the land to see if there was a way of escape.
Surely there is a reminder in this for whosoever has a heart (to feel), or takes heed.
We created the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them, in six spans, and no weariness came upon Us.
So you bear with patience what they say, and sing the praises of your Lord before the rising of the sun and its setting,
And glorify Him for some portion of the night, and additional adorations.
Take heed that the day the crier calls from a place close (to every one),
The day they actually hear the blast, will be the Day of rising of the dead.
We are the one who give life and death, and to Us will be the destination.
The day the earth will split asunder they will come out hurriedly. This gathering together is easy for Us.
We are cognisant of what they say; but it is not for you to compel them.
So keep on reminding through the Qur'an whoever fears My warning.
I CALL TO witness those who scatter (dust) by dispersing,
And those who bear the load (of rain),
And those who move (on the water) gently,
And those who distribute (it) by command,
Verily the promise made to you is true:
The Judgement will indeed take place.
The heavens webbed-with-tracks is witness
You are surely caught in contradictions.,
From which only he turns who is turned away.
Perish will those who just guess and speculate,
Who are lost in deception.
They ask: "When is the Day of Judgement?" --
The day they will be burnt in the Fire,
(And told:) "Taste your punishment.
This is what you were trying to hasten."
Surely those who fear God and follow the straight path will be amidst gardens and fresh springs of water,
Receiving what is given them by their Lord. They were surely the virtuous before this.
They slept little in the night,
And every morning asked forgiveness,
In whose wealth the suppliant and the deprived had a share.
There are signs in the earth for those who are firm in their faith,
And within yourselves.
Can you not perceive?
There is in the heavens your sustenance, and whatever has been promised you.
By the Lord of the heavens and the earth, this is certainly true even as you speak.
Has the story of Abraham's honoured guests come to you?
When they came to him, they said: "Peace." He answered: "Peace."
So he hurried to the house and brought a fatted calf,
And placing it before them said: "Won't you eat?"
He felt afraid of them; but they said: "Have no fear," and gave him the good news of a wise son.
His wife came out lamenting, striking her forehead, and said: "I, am old and barren woman?"
They said: "Thus said your Lord.
He is indeed all-wise and all-knowing."
He said: "What is then your business, O messengers?"
They said: "We have been sent to a wicked people
So as to let loose clods of clay on them
Marked by your Lord for those who waste their substance."
So We evacuated everyone who was a believer there,
But did not find more than a single family of believers.
We left a sign in this for those who fear the grievous punishment,
As (there was) in Moses when We sent him to the Pharaoh with clear authority.
But he turned to his counsellors, and said: "He is a magician or lunatic."
So We seized him and his armies, and threw them into the sea, for he was worthy of blame.
In 'Ad (also is a sign), when We sent a blasting wind against them,
Which turned everything it touched to ashes.
And in Thamud, when We said to them: "Enjoy yourselves for a while;"
But they disobeyed the command of their Lord; so they were destroyed by a thunderbolt, and they could only gape,
And neither stand up nor defend themselves.
(So had We destroyed) the people of Noah before them: They were surely a sinful people.
We built the heavens by Our authority; and We are the Lord of power and expanse.
We spread the earth a carpet; what comfort We provide!
And We created pairs of everything that you may contemplate.
So turn to God.
I give you a clear warning from Him.
Do not set up another god with God.
I give you a clear warning from Him.
Even thus no apostle came to those before them but they said: "He is a sorcerer or a mad man."
Is this the legacy they have passed down from one to the other?
In fact, they are a rebellious people.
Turn away from them. You will not be blamed.
But go on reminding them, as reminding benefits the believers.
I have not created the jinns and men but to worship Me.
I want no sustenance from them nor do I want them to feed Me.
God is certainly the great provider, Lord of strength and power.
Those who do wrong will indeed come to the same end as their fellows (of old). So let them not ask Me to hasten (the punishment).
Alas the woe for those who refuse to believe in the Day which has been promised them.
I CALL TO witness the Mount Sinai,
And the Scripture inscribed
On a parchment scroll unrolled,
The house ever-peopled,
The roof raised high,
And the swollen sea,
The punishment of your Lord is certain to come.
There is none who could avert it.
The day the sky will tremble,
The mountains move and fly away,
Will be the day of woe for those
Who, ignoring the Reality, engage in pleasantries.
The day they are dragged and pushed into Hell,
(And told:) "This is the fire which you denied.
Is it magic, or you cannot see?
Roast in it. Bear it with patience or impatience, it will be the same for you.
You will be requited for what you had done."
Those who fear God and follow the straight path will surely be in gardens and in bliss,
Rejoicing at what their Lord has given them; and their Lord will preserve them from the torment of Hell.
"Eat and drink with relish," (they will be told), (as recompense) for what you had done."
They would recline on couches set in rows, paired with fair companions (clean of thought and) bright of eye.
And those who believed, and whose progeny also followed them in their faith, will be united with their offspring.
We will not deprive them of their labour in the least.
Every man is bound to what he does.
We shall give them fruits and meats, and what they desire.
They will exchange cups of wine free of (incitement to) pleasantry or sin.
And young attendants like pearls within their shells, will go round.
They will ask each other questions,
Saying: "We were also once full of fear at home.
But God has been gracious to us, and has saved us from the torment of scorching wind.
We used to pray to Him erstwhile; He is the just and merciful.
Remind them, therefore, that by the grace of your Lord you are neither a soothsayer nor possessed.
Do they say: "He is a poet for whom we expect an adverse turn of fortune?"
Tell them: "Keep on expecting, I am expecting with you."
Does their reasoning prompt them to this, or they are a people rebellious?
Or do they say: "He has fabricated it?"
In fact, they will never believe.
So let them bring a discourse like it, if they are truthful
Or were they created of themselves? Or are they the creators?
Or have they created the heavens and the earth?
In fact they are certain of nothing.
Do they possess the treasures of your Lord? Or are they the treasurers?
Or do they have a ladder (climbing which) they can hear (the secrets of heaven)?
Let one who has heard then bring a clear proof.
Has (God) daughters and they sons?
Or do you demand any wages from them so that they are burdened with expense?
Or do they have knowledge of the Unknown which they write down?
Or do they want to stage a deception? -- Then only those who do not believe will be the ones who will be tricked.
Or do they have a god apart from God?
He is too exalted for what they associate with Him!
If they should see a segment falling from the sky, they would say: "It is only a massive cloud."
So, leave them until they face their day (of doom) when they will be stunned.
Their deception will not avail them in the least on that day, nor will they be helped.
Surely there are other torments besides this for those who are wicked, though most of them do not know.
Await the judgement of your Lord, for you are always before Our eyes, and glorify your Lord with praises when you rise,
And glorify Him in the night and when the stars begin to wane.
I CALL TO witness the star of the pleiades when it has dipped
That your companion is not confused, nor has he gone astray,
Neither does he speak of his own will.
This is only revelation communicated,
Bestowed on him by the Supreme Intellect,
Lord of power and wisdom. So he acquired poise and balance,
And reached the highest pinnacle.
Then he drew near and drew closer
Until a space of two bow (arcs) or even less remained,
When He revealed to His votary what He revealed.
His heart did not falsify what he perceived.
Will you dispute with him what he saw?
He saw Him indeed another time
By the Lote-tree beyond which none can pass,
Close to which is the Garden of Tranquility,
When the Lote-tree was covered over with what it was covered over;
Neither did sight falter nor exceed the bounds.
Indeed he saw some of the greatest signs of His Lord.
Have you considered Lat and 'Uzza,
And Manat, the other third (of the pagan deities)?
Are there sons for you, and daughters for Him?
This is certainly an unjust apportioning.
These are only names which you and your fathers have invented. No authority was sent down by God for them.
They only follow conjecture and wish-fulfilment, even though guidance had come to them already from their Lord.
Can ever man get what he desires?
To God belong the End and the Beginning.
Many as the angels be in heaven their intercession will not avail in the least without God's permission for whomsoever He please and approve.
Those who do not believe in the Hereafter give the angels names of females.
Yet they have no knowledge of this, and follow nothing but conjecture, but conjecture cannot replace the truth.
So you turn away from him who turns away from Our rememberance and wants nothing but the life of this world:
This is the farthest limit of their knowledge.
Surely your Lord alone knows best who has strayed away from the path and who has come to guidance.
To God belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth, that He may requite those who do evil, in accordance with their deeds, and those who do good with good.
As for those who avoid the greater sins and shameful acts, except minor trespasses, your Lord's forgiveness surely has great amplitude.
He is fully knowledgeable of you as He produced you from the earth, and since you were a foetus in your mother's womb.
So do not assert your goodness; he is better who takes heed and preserves himself.
Have you seen him who turns his back,
Who gives but little, and is niggardly?
Has he knowledge of the Unknown that he perceives everything?
Has he not heard what is contained in the Book of Moses,
And of Abraham who fulfilled his trust? --
That no one who carries a burden bears another's load;
That a man receives but only that for which he strives;
That his endeavours will be judged,
And only then will he receive his recompense in full;
And that to your Lord is your returning;
That it is He who makes you happy and morose,
And He who ordains death and life;
That He created pairs, male and female,
From a drop of semen when emitted;
That the second creation is incumbent on Him;
That it is He who makes you rich and contented;
That He is the Lord of Sirius;
That it was He who destroyed the 'Ad of old,
And Thamud, and did not leave them,
Like the people of Noah before them, who were surely oppressors and rebellious;
And He overthrew the Cities of the Plain,
So that they were covered over by what they were covered over.
How many favours of your Lord will you then deny?
He who warns you is one of the warners of old.
What is to come is imminent.
There is no one to unveil it apart from God.
Are you astonished at this news,
And keep laughing and do not weep,
Indulging in pleasantries?
Bow instead in adoration before God and worship Him.
THE HOUR HAS come and split is the moon.
But if they see a sign they turn away, and say: "This is the same old lie continuing,"
And deny, and follow their own vain desires; but every matter is determined at its time.
Messages deterring them from evil had come to them,
Containing consummate wisdom; yet warnings were of no avail.
So turn away from them.
When on the Day the crier calls to the painful business,
They will come out of the graves with downcast eyes like an expanding swarm of locusts.
They will hasten forward to the caller, gazes fixed.
And the unbelievers will say: "This is the day of untold woe."
The people of Noah had denied before them, and had called Our votary a liar, and said: "He is possessed," and repulsed him.
So he prayed to his Lord: "I am helpless, deliver me."
And We opened up the flood gates of the sky with water pouring down in torrents,
And We opened up the springs of the earth; and the waters met for a decreed end.
But We bore him on a (vessel made) of planks and oakum,
Which sailed right under Our eyes: A recompense for him who had been denied.
And We left it as a sign.
Is there anyone who will be warned?
How was then My punishment and My commination!
Easy have We made the Qur'an to understand: So is there any one who will be warned?
The 'Ad had also disavowed. How was then My punishment and My commination!
We let loose against them a violent roaring wind on a day of ill omen, continuous,
Which snatched away men as though they were palm trees pulled out by the roots.
How was then My punishment and My commination!
Easy have We made the Qur'an to understand: So is there any one who will pay heed?
The Thamud rejected the warnings,
And said: "Should we follow only one man among us?
In that case we shall he in error and insane.
Was he the one of all of us to have been given the exposition?
He is surely an impudent liar."
"Tomorrow they will know who is the impudent liar!
We shall send the she-camel to try them.
So watch them, and be constant.
Tell them that the water is to be apportioned between them (and her); and every turn of drinking will be fixed (for each)."
But they called their commander, who seized and hamstrung her.
How was then My punishment of which they had been warned?
We sent a single blast against them, and they were reduced to husks of a decayed fence.
Easy have We made the Qur'an to understand: So is there any one who will be warned?
The people of Lot rejected the warnings.
We sent a stone-hurtling storm against them, except the family of Lot whom We saved in the early hours of the morning
As a favour from Us.
That is how We reward the grateful.
He had warned them of Our might, but they passed over the warnings.
They lusted after his guests, so We put out their eyes (and said): "Taste My punishment and My commination."
And early in the morning the decreed punishment came upon them.
So now taste My punishment and My commination!
Easy have We made the Qur'an to understand: So is there any one who will be warned?
The warnings came to the people of Pharaoh.
They rejected each one of Our signs. So We seized them with the grip of one mighty and powerful.
Are the unbelievers among you any better than they?
Or is there immunity for you in the Scriptures?
Or do they say: "We are a well-accoutred army?"
The army will be routed and put to flight.
Surely the Hour will be the moment of their promise, and that moment will be calamitous and distressing.
Surely the sinners are misguided and insane.
On that Day they will be dragged into the fire faces foremost, (and told:) "Taste the feel of Hell."
We have indeed created all things by measure;
And Our command is but one (word) swift as the winking of an eye.
We have destroyed the likes of you in the past: So is there any one who will be warned?
All things they do are (recorded) in the books;
All things small or great have been written down.
Surely those who fear God and follow the straight path will be amidst gardens and light,
At the still centre in the proximity of the King all-powerful.
AR-RAHMAN
Bestowed the Qur'an,
Created man,
And taught him to express clearly.
The sun and moon revolve to a computation;
And the grasses and the trees bow (to Him) in adoration.
He raised the sky and set the Balance
So that none may err against the scales,
And observe correct measure, weigh with justice, and not cheat the balance.
He positioned the earth for all the creatures:
There are fruits of all kinds on it, and date-palms with their clusters sheathed,
Grain with husk, and fragrant grasses.
How many favours of your Lord will then both of you deny?
He created man of fermented clay dried tinkling hard like earthen ware,
And created jinns from the white-hot flame of fire.
How many favours of your Lord will you then deny?
Lord of the two Easts, Lord of the two Wests.
How many favours of your Lord will then both of you deny?
He has set two seas in motion that flow side by side together,
With an interstice between them which they cannot cross.
How many favours of your Lord will then both of you deny? --
Out of them come pearls and coral.
How many favours of your Lord will you then deny?
His are the high-sailed vessels in deep ocean like the mountains.
How many favours of your Lord will then both of you deny?
All that is on the earth is passing,
But abiding is the glory of your Lord, full of majesty and beneficence.
How many favours of your Lord will you then deny?
All those there are in the heavens and the earth turn to Him with solicitation, intent on His purpose all the time.
How many favours of your Lord will you then deny?
We shall soon be free to turn to you, O weary caravans,
How many favours of your Lord will you then deny?
O society of jinns and men, cross the bounds of the heavens and the earth if you have the ability, then pass beyond them; but you cannot unless you acquire the law.
How many favours of your Lord will you then deny?
Let loose at you will be smokeless flames of fire so that you will not be able to defend yourselves.
How many favours of your Lord will then both of you deny?
When the sky will split asunder, and turn rosy like the dregs of annointing oil,
Which of the favours of your Lord will you then deny?
Neither man nor jinn will be questioned on that day about his sin.
How many favours of your Lord will you then deny?
The sinners will be recognised by their marks, and seized by the forelock and their feet.
Which of the favours of your Lord will you then deny?
This is Hell the sinners called a lie.
They will go round and around between it and boiling water.
Which of the favours of your Lord will you then deny?
But for him who lived in awe of the sublimity of his Lord, there will be two gardens --
How many favours of your Lord will then both of you deny? --
Full of overhanging branches --
Which of the favours of your Lord will you then deny? --
With two springs of water flowing through them both. --
Which of the favours of your Lord will then both of you deny?
In both of them there will be every kind of fruits in pairs. --
Which of the favours of your Lord will then both of you deny? --
Reclining there on carpets lined with brocade, fruits of the garden hanging low within reach.
How many favours of your Lord will then both of you deny?
In them maidens with averted glances, undeflowered by man or by jinn before them, --
Which of the favours of your Lord will then both of you deny? --
As though rubies and pearls.
Which of the favours of your Lord will then both of you deny?
Should the reward of goodness be aught else but goodness? --
How many favours of your Lord will then both of you deny? --
And besides these two other gardens --
Which of the favours of your Lord will then both of you deny? --
Of darkest verdant green --
How many favours of your Lord will then both of you deny? --
With two fountains gushing constantly, --
How many favours of your Lord will then both of you deny? --
With fruits in them, and dates and pomegranates --
How many favours of your Lord will then both of you deny? --
In them good and comely maidens --
How many favours of your Lord will you then deny? --
Houris cloistered in pavilions --
How many favours of your Lord will you then deny? --
Undeflowered by man or by jinn before them, --
How many favours of your Lord will then both of you deny? --
Reclining on green cushions and rich carpets excellent.
How many favours of your Lord will you then deny?
Blessed be the name of your Lord, full of majesty and beneficience.
WHEN WHAT IS to happen comes to pass --
Which is bound to happen undoubtedly --
Degrading (some) and exalting (others);
When the earth is shaken up convulsively,
The mountains bruised and crushed,
Turned to dust, floating in the air,
You will become three categories:
Those of the right hand -- how (happy) will be those of the right hand!
Then those of the left hand -- how (unhappy) will be those of the left hand!
Then the foremost, how pre-excellent,
Who will be honoured
In gardens of tranquility;
A number of the earlier peoples,
And a few of later ages,
On couches wrought of gold,
Reclining face to face.
Youths of never-ending bloom will pass round to them
Cups and decanters, beakers full of sparkling wine,
Unheady, uninebriating;
And such fruits as they fancy,
Bird meats that they relish,
And companions with big beautiful eyes
Like pearls within their shells,
As recompense for all they had done.
They will hear no nonsense there or talk of sin,
Other than "Peace, peace" the salutation.
As for those of the right hand -- how (happy) those of the right hand --
They will be in (the shade) of thornless lote
And acacia covered with heaps of bloom,
Lengthened shadows,
Gushing water,
And fruits numberless,
Unending, unforbidden,
And maidens incomparable.
We have formed them in a distinctive fashion,
And made them virginal,
Loving companions matched in age,
For those of the right hand.
A crowd of earlier generations
And a crowd of the later.
But those of the left hand -- how (unhappy) those of the left hand --
Will be in the scorching wind and boiling water,
Under the shadow of thick black smoke
Neither cool nor agreeable.
They were endowed with good things
But persisted in that greater sin,
And said: "What!
When we are dead and turned to dust and bones, shall we then be raised again?
And so will our fathers?"
Say: "Indeed, the earlier and the later generations
Will be gathered together on a certain day which is predetermined.
Then you, the erring and the deniers,
Will eat of the tree of Zaqqum,
Fill your bellies with it,
And drink over it scalding water,
Lapping it up like female camels raging of thirst with disease."
Such will be their welcome on the Day of Judgement.
It is He who created you, then why do you not affirm the truth?
Just consider (the semen) that you emit,
Do you create it, or We are its creator?
We have incorporated death in your constitution, and We shall not be hindered
From replacing you with others or raising you in a way you do not know.
You have known the first creation, then why do you not reflect?
Just ponder over what you sow:
Do you give it its increase, or are We the giver?
We could turn it, if We pleased, into straw; then you would rue the day,
(And say:) "We have fallen into debt;
Indeed, we have been deprived of the fruits of our labour."
Consider the water that you drink.
Do you send it down from the clouds, or We send it down?
We could make it brackish, if We pleased; so why do you not acknowledge thanks?
Consider the fire that you strike (and get by friction).
Have you raised its tree, or We have raised it?
We have made it as a reminder and convenience for the needy.
So glorify your Lord, the most supreme.
So I call the placement of the stars to witness --
And this surely is great evidence if you can understand --
That this is indeed the glorious Qur'an
(Inscribed) in the well-kept Book.
Only they can reach it who are clean (of mind).
It has been revealed by the Lord of all the worlds.
Then why do you dissimulate this Revelation?
You live by calling it a lie.
Then how is it that when the (dying) breath is withdrawn into the throat (and rattles),
And you wait for the moment (of death),
We are closer to him than you, even though you cannot see?
Then why, if you are not indebted (to Us for life),
Can you not bring him back? (Answer) if you are truthful
Then, if he is one of the honoured,
There will be peace and plenty, and gardens of tranquility for him.
If he is of those of the right hand,
There will be the salutation by those of the right hand: "Peace on you.
But if he is of the deniers and the errants,
The welcome will be boiling water
And the roasting in Hell.
This is indeed the ultimate truth.
Then praise your Lord, the most supreme.
WHATSOEVER IS IN the heavens and the earth sings the praises of God. He is all-mighty and all-wise.
His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, He is the giver of life and death, and He has power over everything.
He is the first and He the last, the transcendent and the immanent; and He has knowledge of everything.
It is He who created the heavens and the earth in six stages, then assumed the throne.
He knows whatsoever enters the earth, and whatsoever comes out of it, and what comes down from the sky and what goes up to it; and He is with you wheresoever you may be, and He perceives whatsoever you do.
His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and all things will go back to Him.
He turns night into day, and turns day into night; and He knows whatsoever is in your hearts.
Believe in God and His Apostle, and spend of what He has given you as His trustee.
And those of you who believe and spend in charity will have a great reward.
What has come upon you that you believe not in God, though the Prophet is calling you to believe in your Lord? And He has already taken your pledge, if you are believers.
It is He who sends down splendent revelations to His votary that he may take you out of darkness into light; for surely God is gracious and kind to you.
What has come upon you that you do not spend in the way of God, when the heritage of the heavens and the earth belongs to God?
Those of you who spent before the victory and fought, are not equal (to those who did not).
They are higher in position than those who spent after (the victory) and fought.
To each one God has made the promise of excellence, for God is aware of all you do.
Who will give a goodly loan to God which He will double for him, and be for him a splendid reward?
The day you see the believers, men and women, with their light advancing ahead and to the right of them, (they will be told:) "There is good news for you this day, of gardens with rivers flowing by where you will live for ever."
This will be the great attainment.
The day the hypocrites, men and women, will say to the believers: "Wait for us that we may borrow a little light from your light," they will be told: "Go back, and look for your light."
A wall shall be raised between them in which there will be a door.
Within it will be benevolence and retribution without.
They will call to them: "Were we not with you?"
They will answer: "Certainly; but then you let yourselves be tempted, and waited in expectation but were suspicious and were deceived by vain desires, till the decree of God came to pass, and the deceiver duped you in respect of God.
So no ransom will be accepted of you on this day, or of those who refused to believe.
Hell will be your refuge and the only friend -- and how evil a destination!"
Has the moment not yet come when the hearts of believers should be moved by the thought of God and the truth that has been sent down, so that they should not be like those who received the Book before them but whose hearts were hardened after a lapse of time, and many of them turned disobedient?
Know that God enlivens the earth even after it has died.
We have explained to you clearly Our signs that you may understand.
Surely the men and women who spend in charity and give a goodly loan to God, will have it doubled for them and will receive a generous reward.
Those who believe in God and His apostles are true of word and deed; and by their Lord are considered testifiers of the truth. They have their guerdon and their light.
As for those who do not believe and reject Our revelations, are the people of Hell.
Know that the life of this world is only a frolic and mummery, an ornamentation, boasting and bragging among yourselves, and lust for multiplying wealth and children.
It is like rain so pleasing to the cultivator for his vegetation which sprouts and swells, and then begins to wither, and you see it turn to yellow and reduced to chaff. There is severe punishment in the Hereafter, but also forgiveness from God, and acceptance.
As for the life of this world, it is no more than merchandise of vanity.
Hasten for the forgiveness of your Lord and Paradise whose expanse is as wide as that of the heavens and the earth, which has been prepared for those who believe in God and His apostles.
This is the bounty of God which He bestows on whosoever He please; and the bounty of God is infinite.
There is no calamity that befalls the earth or your own selves but in accordance with the law (of causation) before We make it evident. This is indeed how the law of God works inevitably.
Lest you grieve for what you missed, or rejoice at what you received.
God does not love the egoist and the braggart,
Who hold back what they possess and enjoin stinginess on others.
Whoever turns away (from God, should remember) that God is self-sufficient, worthy of praise.
We have surely sent apostles with clear signs, and sent with them the Book and the Balance, so that men may stand by justice; and We sent down iron which causes much distress but also has advantages for men, so that God may know who helps Him and His apostles in secret.
Verily God is all-powerful and all-mighty.
We sent Noah and Abraham, and gave prophethood to their progeny and the Book, and some of them are well-directed, but many of them are disobedient.
Then in their train We sent Our apostles, and succeeding them Jesus, son of Mary, and gave him the Gospel, and put into the hearts of his followers compassion and kindness.
But they created monasticism which had not been prescribed for them by Us except for seeking the pleasure of God; yet they did not observe it as it should have been rightly observed. So We gave those among them who were believers their reward; but most of them are disobedient.
O you who believe, have fear of displeasing God, and believe in His Prophet.
He will give you twice as much of His bounty and place a light for you to walk in, and forgive you, for God is forgiving and kind;
So that the people of the Book may know that they have not the least power over the bounty of God, and that the bounty is wholly in the hands of God to give whosoever He please, for God is the master of infinite bounty.
GOD CERTAINLY HEARD what the woman who argued with you about her husband, said, and complained to God; and God heard your interrogation.
Verily God hears all, and sees everything.
Those of you who divorce your wives by calling them 'mothers,' cannot (make them) their mothers. Their mothers are only those who gave birth to them.
Those who call their wives their mothers then revoke what they had said, should free a slave before having physical contact (with them).
This is to warn you, as God is aware of what you do.
If one does not have the means (of doing so) then he should fast for two months continuously before he has physical contact; but any one who is unable to do so, should feed sixty needy persons.
This (is enjoined) so that you may be faithful to God and His Apostle.
These are the limits set by God. As for the unbelievers, there is painful punishment for them.
Those who oppose God will be disgraced, as those before them were. We have sent down very clear signs.
For unbelievers there is a shameful punishment.
On the day when God will raise them up together, He will tell them what they did.
God takes account of it although they forget, for all things are evident to God.
Have you not considered that God knows whatever is in the heavens and the earth?
No three persons confer secretly but He is the fourth among them, and no five but He is the sixth; and neither fewer nor more but He is with them wheresoever they be.
And on the Day of Judgement He will announce their deeds to them.
Verily God has knowledge of everything.
Have you not considered those who were forbidden to conspire, but reverted after a time to what was forbidden them, and conspired evil, rebellion and disobedience to the Prophet?
Yet when they come to you they greet you with a greeting even God does not greet you with; and say to themselves, "Why doesn't God punish us for what we say?"
Hell is sufficient for them, in which they will be burnt: And what an evil consequence!
O you who believe, when you converse privately, do not talk of iniquity, rebellion, and disobedience to the Prophet, but talk of goodness and piety, and fear God before whom you will be gathered.
Surely scheming is the work of Satan that he may cause the faithful grief; but he cannot harm them unless God dispense.
So in God should the believers place their trust.
O you who believe, when you are told to make room in the assemblies, then make room; God will give you more room to spread.
When you are told to rise, then rise; God will raise those of you who believe, and those who have knowledge, in position.
God is aware of what you do.
O you who believe, if you confer with the Prophet in private, give alms in the name of God before you go to confer.
This is better for you and becoming.
If you do not have the means, then surely God is forgiving and kind.
Are you afraid of giving alms before confering?
Then, if you cannot do this, and God forgives you, be constant in your devotional obligations and pay the due share of your wealth for the welfare of others, and obey God and His Prophet.
God is aware of all you do.
Have you not seen those who have taken a people who have roused the wrath of God, as friends?
They are neither of you nor of them, and swear to a lie, and knowingly.
God has reserved a severe punishment for them.
Evil indeed are the things they do!
They have made their oaths a shield, and obstruct people from the way of God. There is shameful punishment for them.
Neither their wealth nor children will avail them against God.
They are the people of Hell, and there will abide for ever.
On the day that God will raise them together, they will swear before Him as they swear before you, and imagine they are on the right path.
Is it not they who are liars?
Satan has got the better of them. and made them forget to remember God.
Indeed they belong to Satan's faction.
Will not Satan's faction perish?
Surely those who oppose God and His Prophet will be among the vilest.
God has decreed: "I will prevail, I and My apostles."
Verily God is powerful and all-mighty.
You will not find those who believe in God and the Day of Resurrection, loving those who oppose God and His Prophet, even though they be their fathers, sons, or brothers or their kin.
God has inscribed on their hearts belief, and has succoured them with His own grace, and will admit them to gardens with rivers flowing by, where they will abide for ever, God accepting them, and they, happy in the pleasure of God.
They are verily the army of God.
Will not the army of God be victorious?
WHATEVER IS IN the heavens and the earth sings the praises of God. He is all-mighty and all-wise.
It is He who drove those among the people of the Book who refused to believe, from their homes for the first confrontation.
You did not think that they would go away, and they imagined that their forts would protect them against God.
But God came upon them from where they did not suspect, and filled their hearts with terror, so that they destroyed their homes with their own hands (or were destroyed) by the hands of believers.
So take heed, O men of sight!
Had God not decreed the expulsion for them He would have punished them in this world, and in the next the punishment of Hell would have been theirs.
For they had opposed God and His Apostle; and whosoever opposes God, then God is severe in retribution.
The palm trees that you cut down or left standing intact was by God's dispensation, so that He might disgrace the transgressors.
You did not charge with horse or camel for whatever (spoils) God gave His Apostle from them. In any case, God gives authority to His Apostle over whomsoever He please.
Whatever booty God gives to His Apostle from the people of the cities, is for God and His Apostle, the near relations, the orphans, the needy and wayfarers, so that it does not concentrate in the hands of those who are rich among you.
Accept what the Apostle gives you, and refrain from what he forbids, and take heed for yourself and fear God.
Surely God is severe of retribution.
The spoils are also for the poor emigrants who were deprived of their homes and possessions and are seeking the bounty and protection of God, and are helping God and His Apostle.
They are the ones who are true of word and deed.
Those who came to the city and to faith before them, love those who take refuge with them, and do not feel for themselves any need for what is given them, and give them preference over themselves even if they are indigent.
Whoever preserves himself from his own greed will be prosperous.
(And the spoils are for) those who came after them, who say: "O Lord, forgive us and our brothers who came to faith before us, and do not put a grudge in our hearts against those who believe O Lord, You are compassionate and kind."
Have you never considered the hypocrites?
They say to their brethren among the people of the Book who do not believe: "If you are driven out we shall go with you, and will not listen to any one in what concerns you; and if there is war against you, we shall aid you."
But God is witness they are liars.
If they are driven out, they will not go with them; and if they are attacked, they will not aid them.
And even if they aided them, they will turn their backs, then they will not be helped.
Surely they have greater fear of you in their hearts than of God, because they do not understand.
They will not fight you in a body except in fortified cities, or from behind the walls. Their enmity among themselves is great.
You think they are united, but divided are their hearts.
That is because these people are devoid of sense,
Like those who had tasted the gravity of their actions a little before them.
There is a grievous punishment for them.
(They are) like Satan who says to man: "Do not believe;" and when he becomes a disbeliever, he says: "I have nothing to do with you. I fear God, the Lord of all the worlds."
Both of them will end up in Hell, where they will abide for ever.
This is the punishment for the wicked.
O you who believe, be fearful of God. Let each soul consider what it has sent (of good deeds) in advance for the morrow, and fear God.
Surely God is aware of what you do.
And be not like those who have forgotten God, so that God has made them forget themselves.
Such are the reprobates.
Alike are not the inmates of Hell and the residents of Paradise.
The men of Paradise will be felicitous.
If We had sent down this Qur'an to a mountain you would have seen it turn desolate and split into two for fear of God.
We offer these examples to men that they may think and reflect.
He is God; there is no god but He, the knower of the unknown and the known.
He is the benevolent, ever-merciful.
He is God; there is no god but He, the King, the Holy, the Preserver, Protector, Guardian, the Strong, the Powerful, Omnipotent.
Far too exalted is God for what they associate with Him.
He is God, the Creator, the Maker, the Fashioner.
His are all the names beautiful.
Whatever is in the heavens and the earth sings His praises. He is all-mighty and all-wise.
O YOU WHO BELIEVE, do not take My enemies and your enemies as friends. You show kindness to them, but they reject the true way that has come to you.
They expelled the Prophet and you, for you believe in God your Lord. If you have come out to struggle in My cause having sought My acceptance, (do not be) friendly with them in secret.
I know what you hide and what you disclose. Whoever of you does this will have gone astray from the right path.
If they gain ascendancy over you, they will become your enemies, and employ their hands and tongues with evil designs, and wish that you also became disbelievers.
Neither your blood relations nor your children will be of any avail to you on the Day of Resurrection.
He will judge between you, for God sees what you do.
You have an excellent model in Abraham and those who were with him, when he said to his people: "We are through with you, and those you worship other than God.
We reject you.
Enmity and hate have come between you and us for ever, unless you believe in God the One," -- except for what he said to his father: "I shall ask forgiveness for you, but I have no power to prevail with God for you."
"O Lord, we place our trust in You, and turn to You in penitence, and to You is our returning.
O Lord, make us not an example of punishment for infidels, and forgive us, O Lord. You are all-mighty and all-wise."
Those of you who have hope in God and the Last Day have certainly a good example in them.
But whosoever turns away, then surely God is above concern, worthy of praise.
It maybe that God will create love between you and your enemies. God is all-powerful, and God is forgiving, ever-merciful.
God does not forbid you from being kind and acting justly towards those who did not fight over faith with you, nor expelled you from your homes. God indeed loves those who are just.
He only forbids you from making friends with those who fought over faith with you and banished you from your homes, and aided in your exile.
Whoever makes friends with them is a transgressor.
O believers, when believing women come over to you as refugees, then examine them.
God alone is cognisant of their faith.
If you find that they are believers, do not send them back to unbelievers.
They are not lawful for them, nor are infidels lawful for believing women.
Give the unbelievers what they have spent on them.
There is no sin if you marry them provided you give their dowers to them.
Do not retain your (marriage) ties with unbelieving women. Ask for the return of what you have spent (on them); and the unbelievers should ask for the return of what they have spent.
This is the judgement of God.
He judges between you.
God is all-knowing and all-wise.
If any of your women go away to the unbelievers, and you succeed in your turn (and have a chance of getting spoils), then give to those whose wives have so gone away as much as they had spent on them; but take heed and fear God in whom you believe.
O Prophet, when believing women come to you and swear on oath that they will not associate anything with God, nor steal, nor fornicate, nor kill their children, nor accuse others for what they have fabricated themselves, nor disobey you in any rightful thing, then you should accept their allegiance, and ask forgiveness of God for them.
Certainly God is forgiving and kind.
O you who believe, do not make friends with those who have suffered the anger of God by having become despondent of the life to come like those unbelievers who are despondent of those who are in the graves.
ALL THAT IS in the heavens and the earth sings the praises of God. He is all-mighty and all-wise.
O you who believe, why do you profess what you do not practise?
Saying what you do not practice is odious to God.
Surely God loves those who fight in His cause in full formations as though they were a compact wall.
When Moses said to his people: "O my people, why do you afflict me though you know that I have been sent to you by God?"
But when they turned aside God made their hearts turn farther away; for God does not show the transgressors the way.
And when Jesus, son of Mary, said: "O children of Israel, I am sent to you by God to confirm the Torah (sent) before me, and to give you good tidings of an apostle who will come after me, whose name is Ahmad (the praised one)."
Yet when he has come to them with clear proofs, they say: "This is only magic."
Who is more unjust than he who invents a lie against God when he is called to submit?
God does not show the evil-doers the way.
They want to extinguish the light of God by uttering blasphemies. But God wills to perfect His light, however the unbelievers may dislike it.
It is He who sent His Apostle with the guidance and the true way to raise it above all faiths, however the idolaters may dislike it.
O you who believe, may I offer you a bargain which will save you from a painful punishment?
Come to believe in God and His Apostle, and struggle in the cause of God, wealth and soul.
This will be good for you, if you can understand.
He will forgive you your sins and admit you to gardens with rivers flowing by, and excellent mansions in the garden of Eden.
This will be a great fulfilment.
And (He will give you) what is dearest to you -- help from God and early victory.
So give good tidings to those who believe.
O you who believe, be helpers of God, as Jesus, son of Mary, had said to the disciples: "Who will help me in the way of God?" and they had answered: "We are the helpers of God."
Then a section among the children of Israel believed, but a section among them did not.
So We helped those who believed against their enemies, and they prevailed over them.
ALL THAT IS in the heavens and the earth sings the praises of God the King, the Holy, Omnipotent, the Wise.
It is He who raised among the gentiles an apostle from amongst them, who recites His revelations to them, reforms them and teaches them the Scripture and the Law, for before him they were clearly in error.
And for others among them who have not joined them yet.
He is all-mighty and all-wise.
This is the bounty of God, He gives whosoever He please. God is master of great bounty.
The likeness of those who were charged with (the law of) the Torah which they did not observe, is that of a donkey who carries a load of books (oblivious of what they contain).
How wretched the semblance of the people who deny the words of God!
God does not show an unjust people the way.
Say: "O you Jews, if you claim that you are the favourites of God apart from all men, then wish for death, if you speak the truth.
But they will never wish for death because of what they had done in the past, and God knows the sinners well.
Tell them: "Death from which you run, will surely come to you.
You will then be sent back to Him who knows the unknown and the known, who will tell you what you used to do.
O you who believe, when the call to prayer is made on the day of congregation, hasten to remember God, putting aside your business.
This is better for you if you can understand.
And when the service of prayer is over spread out in the land, and look for the bounty of God. and remember God a great deal that you may prosper.
Yet when they see some buying and selling, or some sport, they go for it, leaving you standing.
Tell them: "What is with God is better than your sport and commerce. And God is the best of providers."
WHEN THE HYPOCRITES come to you, they say: "We affirm that you are the Apostle of God."
God indeed knows you are His Apostle.
God bears witness that the hypocrites are indeed liars.
They have made their oaths a shield in order to obstruct others from the way of God.
It is certainly evil what they do.
That is because they came to believe, and then renounced (their faith).
So their hearts were sealed; and now they do not understand.
Pleasing seem their persons when you look at them; and when they talk, you listen to their speech.
Yet they are like the wooden panelling of a wall.
They imagine every rebuke to be directed against them.
They are the enemies, beware of them.
May God damn them, how pervert are they!
When you tell them: "Come, let the Apostle of God ask forgiveness for you," they turn their heads, and you see them turning away with arrogance.
Whether you ask forgiveness for them or do not ask, it is all the same; God will not forgive them.
Surely God does not show a disobedient people the way.
They are the ones who say: "Do not spend on those who are with the Apostle of God till they break away (from him)." To God belong the treasures of the heavens and the earth; but the hypocrites do not understand.
They say: "If we now go back to Madina, the stronger will turn the weaker out." But power belongs to God, His Apostle and the faithful, though the hypocrites do not know.
O you who believe, let not your wealth and children make you negligent of the remembrance of God.
Those who do so will be losers.
Spend of what We have given you before death comes to one of you, when he will say: "O Lord, why did you not defer my term for a while that I could give alms and be among the doers of good?"
But God does not grant a soul respite once its term has come to end. And God is aware of what you do.
ALL THAT THERE is in the heavens and the earth sings the praises of God. His the sovereignty and His is the praise, and He has power over everything.
It is He who created you, though one of you is an infidel and one of you a believer; yet God perceives what you do.
He created the heavens and the earth with deliberation, and gave you form, and shaped you well; and to Him is your returning.
He knows what is in the heavens and the earth, and knows what you hide and what you disclose; God knows what is in the hearts.
Has not the account of those who disbelieved before come to you, who tasted the torment of their action, and for whom is grievous punishment?
This was so because their apostles came to them with clear proofs, but they said: "What. Can a mortal show us the way?"
And they denied and turned away; but God was unconcerned. God is all-sufficient, worthy of praise.
The unbelievers claim that they will not be raised again. Tell them: "Why not?
By my Lord, you will certainly be raised again, and then informed of what you had done.
That is how the law of God works inevitably."
So believe in God, His Apostle and the Light We have sent down.
God is well aware of what you do.
The day He will gather you together on the Day of Gathering, will be the day of Judgement.
He who believed and did the right, will have his evil deeds expunged by God and admitted to gardens with rivers flowing by, and abide there perpetually.
This will be the great achievement of success.
Those who did not believe and denied Our revelations will be inmates of Hell, where they will abide for ever, and how evil a journey's end!
No calamity befalls unless God dispenses.
He guides the heart of whosoever believes in God; and God has knowledge of everything.
Obey God and obey His Apostle.
If you turn away, the duty of the Apostle is to convey the message clearly.
God: There is no god but He; and in God should believers place their trust.
O believers, some of your spouses and children are your enemies, so beware of them!
Yet if you forbear, overlook, and forgive, God is indeed forgiving and kind.
Your wealth and children are surely meant as trial for you: But with God is the great reward.
So fear God as much as you can, and listen and obey, and spend in charity for your own good.
He who is saved from his own avarice will be successful.
If you lend a goodly loan to God, He will double it for you, and forgive you. God knows the worth of good deeds and is clement,
The knower of the unknown and the known, all-mighty and all-wise.
O PROPHET WHEN you divorce women, divorce them at their appointed period, and calculate that period, and fear God, your Lord.
Do not expel them from their houses, nor should they go away themselves, unless they are openly guilty of adultery.
These are the limits set by God. Any one who exceeds the limits set by God sins against his own self.
You never know that God may perchance lead to a new situation after this.
When they have reached their appointed time, then either keep them lawfully or let them go honourably; but have two witnesses from among you, and give truthful evidence for (being acceptable to) God.
This is to warn him who believes in God and the Last Day. God will furnish a way out for him who fears Him,
And provide for him from where he does not reckon.
God is sufficient for him who places his trust in Him.
Certainly God fulfills His purpose. God has indeed fixed a measure of everything.
As for your women who have lost hope of menstruation, and in case you have a doubt, the prescribed period (of waiting) for them is three months, as also for those who have not menstruated yet.
As for those who are pregnant, their prescribed period is until the delivery of the child.
God will make things easy for him who is mindful of God.
This is the commandment of God that is sent down to you.
God will forgive the ills of those who fear Him, and increase their reward.
House the (divorced) women where you live, according to your means; but do not harass them so as to reduce them to straitened circumstances.
If they are pregnant, then spend on them until they give birth to the child.
And if they suckle the child for you, then make the due payment to them, and consult each other appropriately. But if you find this difficult, let some other woman suckle (the child) for her.
Let the man of means spend according to his means, and he whose means are limited, should spend of what God has given him.
God does not burden a soul beyond what He has given him.
God will bring ease after hardship.
How many habitations rebelled against their Lord's command and His apostles; but We took them to severe task, and punished them with the harshest punishment.
So they tasted the pain of their actions; and the consequence of their deeds was ruin.
God has prepared for them severe punishment. So, you men of wisdom, and those who believe, take heed for yourselves and fear God.
God has indeed sent down a Reminder for you,
An Apostle who recites before you the explicating revelations of God that He may bring those who believe and do the right out of darkness into light.
Whosoever believes in God and does the right, He will admit into gardens with rivers flowing by, where they will abide for ever.
How excellent a provision has God made for him
It is God who created several skies, and as many earths.
The commandment is sent down among them so that you may know that God has power over everything, and everything is held within the knowledge of God.
O PROPHET, WHY should you forbid (yourself) what God has made lawful for you, in order to please your wives?
Yet God is forgiving and kind.
Surely God has sanctioned the dissolution of your vows. God is your Lord: He is all-knowing, and all-wise.
When the Prophet told one of his wives something in confidence and she disclosed it, God revealed this to him. So he made some of it known to her, and held back some.
When, however, he informed her about it, she asked: "Who told you this?"
He said: "I was told this by the All-knowing, All-Informed."
If both of you two (women) turn to God in penitence (it would be better).
Your hearts have been impaired; and if you assist one another against him, then surely his helper is God, and Gabriel and the righteous believers, and, besides them, the angels are his helpers.
In case he divorces you, his Lord will give him better wives in return, who will be modest, true believers, obedient to God, repentant, observant of prayer and fasting, both widows and virgins.
O you who believe, save yourselves and your families from the Fire whose fuel is men and rocks, over which are appointed angels stern and severe as wardens who never disobey what God commands them, and do what they are commanded;
(And say:) "O you who do not believe, make no excuses today.
You will be requited only for what you had done."
O you who believe, turn to God truly in repentance.
Perhaps your Lord may forgive your ills and admit you to gardens with rivers flowing by on the day when God will not humiliate the Prophet and those who believe with him.
Their light will move in front of them and to their right, and they will say: "O Lord, perfect our light and forgive us. You have power over every thing."
O Prophet, fight the unbelievers and the hypocrites, and be severe with them.
Their abode is Hell, an evil destination?
God advances the example of Noah's wife and the wife of Lot for those who do not believe. They were married to Our two pious devotees, but they were unfaithful to them, and even (the apostles) could not avail them in the least against God; and it was said to them: "Enter Hell with those (who are condemned) to enter it."
And God presents the example of Pharaoh's wife for those who believe, when she said: "O Lord, build me a house in Paradise, and save me from Pharaoh and his deeds, and save me from a wicked people;"
And of Mary, daughter of 'Imran, who guarded her chastity, so that We breathed into her a new life from Us, and she believed the words of her Lord and His Books, and was among the obedient.
BLESSED BE HE who holds the (reins of) Kingship in His hand, who has power over everything,
Who created death and life in order to try you to see who of you are best of deed. He is all-mighty and forgiving,
Who created the seven skies one above the other.
Do you see any disproportion in the creations of Ar-Rahman?
Turn your eyes again. Do you see any fissures?
Turn your eyes again and again. Your gaze turns back dazed and tired.
We have adorned the lowest sky with lamps, and made them missiles against the devils, for whom We have prepared a torment of most intense fire.
For those who believe not in their Lord there is the punishment of Hell; and what a wretched destination
When they are cast into it, they will hear it roar and raging
As though it would burst with fury.
Every time a crowd is thrown into it, its wardens will ask: "Did no warner come to you?"
And they will answer: "Surely; a warner came to us, but we denied him, and said: 'God did not send down any thing; you are greatly deluded, in fact.'"
They will say: "If we had listened and been wise, we would not have been among the inmates of Hell."
So will they confess their guilt. Deprived (of all joys) will be the inmates of Hell.
For those who fear their Lord in secret is forgiveness and a great reward.
Whether you say a thing secretly or openly, He knows the innermost secrets of your hearts.
Can He who has created not know (His creation)?
He is all-penetrating, all-aware.
It is He who made the earth subservient to you that you may travel all around it, and eat of things He has provided; and to Him will be your resurrection.
Are you so unafraid that He who is in Heaven will not open up the earth to swallow you, when it will begin to tremble?
Or have you become so unafraid that He who is in Heaven will not send a violent wind to shower stones at you?
Then you will know the import of My commination!
Those before them had also denied. And how was My punishment then!
Do they not see the birds above them flying wings spread out or folded?
Nothing holds them aloft but God.
All things are within His purview.
What other army do you have to help you apart from Ar-Rahman?
The unbelievers are surely lost in delusion.
Who is there to give you food in case He withholds His bounty?
Yet they persist in rebellion and aversion.
Will he find the way who grovels flat on his face, or he who walks straight on the right path?
Say: "It is He who raised you and gave you ears and eyes and hearts. How little are the thanks you offer!"
Say: "It is He who dispersed you all over the earth, and to Him you will be gathered."
But they say: "When will this promise come to pass, if what you say is true?"
Say: "God alone has knowledge. My duty is only to warn you clearly."
When they realise it has come upon them, distraught will be the faces of unbelievers. They will be told: "This is what you asked for."
Say: "Just think: If God destroys me and those with me, or is benevolent to us, who will then protect the unbelievers from a painful doom?"
Say: "He is the benevolent; in Him do we believe, and in Him do we place our trust.
You will now realise who is in manifest error."
Say: "Just think: If your water were to dry up in the morning who will bring you water from a fresh, flowing stream?"
NUN. I CALL to witness the pen and what they inscribe,
You are not demented by the grace of your Lord.
There is surely reward unending for you,
For you are verily born of sublime nature.
So you will see, and they will realise,
Who is distracted.
Verily your Lord knows those who have gone astray from His path, and He knows those who are guided on the way.
So do not comply with those who deny:
They only want that you should relent, so that they may come to terms.
Do not heed a contemptible swearer,
Or backbiter, calumniator, slanderer,
Who hinders men from (doing) good, the transgressor, the iniquitous,
Crude, and above all, mean and infamous,
Simply because he possesses wealth and children.
When you recite Our revelations to him, he says: "These are fables of long ago."
We shall brand him on the muzzle.
We have tried you as We tried the owners of the garden when they vowed to gather the fruits in the morning
But did not add: "If God may please."
Then a calamity from your Lord fell upon it, but they remained fast asleep.
So by the morning it seemed as though picked clean.
At daybreak they called to each other:
"If you want to gather the fruits, let us go early to the plantation."
So they departed, talking in low voices:
"Let no needy person come to you within it today."
They left early in the morning bent on this purpose.
When they saw (and did not recognise it) they said: "Surely we have lost the way.
No. In fact we have been deprived of it."
One who was temperate among them, said: "Did I not say: 'Why don't you priase God?'"
"Glory to our Lord," they said; we were really in the wrong."
Then they started blaming one another,
Saying: "Alas the woe, we were iniquitous.
Maybe our Lord will give us better than this. We turn to our Lord in supplication."
Such is Our chastisement; and the punishment of the Hereafter will be greater, if only they knew!
For those who fear God there are pleasure gardens with their Lord.
Should We treat those who submit and obey in the same way as those who are culpable?
What has come upon you that you judge in such a wise?
Or have you a Book in which you read
That you can surely have whatever you choose?
Or have you taken a binding promise from Us which would hold till the Day of Judgement, that you will get whatever you demand?
Ask them: "Which of you is able to vouch for this?"
Or have they any partners?
Let them bring their partners then, if what they say is true.
On the day the great calamity befalls, and they are called to bow in homage, they will not be able to do so.
Lowered will be their eyes, disgrace overwhelming them. They had indeed been called to bow in homage when they were free of blame.
So leave those who deny this Discourse to Me.
We shall lead them step by step to (ruin) in a way they will not know.
Yet I will give them respite: Surely My plan is compact.
Do you ask for any compensation from them that they are burdened with want?
Or do they have knowledge of the unknown which they copy down?
So wait with patience for the judgement of your Lord, and do not be like (onah) of the fish who called (to his Lord) when he was choked with anger.
Had it not been for a favour from his Lord he would have been cast blame-worthy on a barren plain.
Then his Lord chose him and placed him among the upright.
But the unbelievers would like to stare you out of balance when they hear the warning, and say: "Surely he is possessed;"
Whilst it is no more than reminder for the people of the world.
THE CONCRETE REALITY.
What is the concrete reality?
What do you comprehend by the concrete reality?
The Thamud and 'Ad denied the consequential calamity.
So destroyed were the Thamud by a storm of thunder and lightning;
And the 'Ad were destroyed by the furious cold blast of roaring wind
Which He sent to assail them for seven nights and eight days running. You should have seen the people prostrate like the decayed trunks of date-palm trees.
Do you see any trace of them?
Then came the Pharaoh, and those before him whose habitations were overthrown while they were committing crimes.
When they disobeyed the apostle of their Lord He seized them with an overwhelming punishment.
When the water rose in flood, We bore you in the ark,
In order to make it a warning for you, and that the ear retentive may preserve it.
When the single blast is sounded on the trumpet,
And the earth and mountains heaved and crushed to powder with one levelling blow,
On that Day will come what is to come.
The sky will cleave asunder on that day and fall to pieces.
On its fringes will be angels, eight of them, bearing their Lord's throne aloft.
You will then be set before Him, and not one of you will remain unexposed.
He who is given his ledger in his right hand, will say: "Here, read my ledger.
I was certain I'll be given my account."
So he shall have an agreeable life
In high empyrean
With fruits hanging low within reach,
(And told:) "Eat and drink to your fill as reward for (good) deeds you had done in days of yore."
But whosoever gets his ledger in his left hand, will say: "Would that I were never given my ledger,
And not known my account!
I wish death had put an end to me.
Of no use was even my wealth.
Vanished has my power from me."
"Seize him and manacle him,
Then cast him to be burnt in Hell;
And string him to a chain seventy cubits long.
He did not believe in God the supreme,
Nor urged others to feed the poor.
That is why he has no friend today,
Nor food other than suppuration (filth)
Which none but the hellish eat."
So, I call to witness what you see
And what you do not see,
That this is indeed the word of the noble Messenger,
And not the word of a poet. How little is it that you believe!
Nor is it the word of a soothsayer. Little is it that you reflect!
It has been sent down by the Lord of all the worlds.
Had he attributed falsely any words to Us,
We would have seized him by his right hand,
Then cut off his aorta,
And not one of you would have been able to stop (Us).
It is really a reminder for those who fear God and follow the straight path.
We certainly know that some among you do deny it.
It is surely the nemesis of unbelievers.
And He, He is indeed the ultimate Reality.
So glorify your Lord, the most supreme.
AN INQUIRER ASKED for the affliction that is to come
Upon the infidels -- which none would be able to repel --
From God, the Lord of the steps (of progression),
To whom the angels and the soul take a day to ascend, whose length is fifty thousand years.
So persevere with becoming patience.
They surely take it to be far away,
But We see it very near.
The day the sky becomes like molten brass,
The mountains like the tufts of (carded) wool,
And no friend inquires after friend
Though within sight of one another. The sinner would like to ransom himself from the torment of that Day by offering his sons,
His wife and his brother,
And his family who had stood by him,
And all those who are on the earth, to save himself.
But never.
It is pure white flame
That would skin the scalp.
It will summon whoever turns his back and flees,
Who amasses and then hoards.
Surely man is greedy by nature.
If evil befalls him he is perturbed;
If good comes to him he holds back his hand,
Except those who closely follow (the Book of God),
Who persevere in devotion,
In whose wealth a due share is included
For the needy and those dispossessed,
And those who believe in the Day of Judgement,
And those who fear the punishment of their Lord, --
Surely no one can be secure from the punishment of his Lord, --
And those who guard their sex except from their wives and women slaves of old
Are free of blame,
But those who seek more than this will be transgressors;
And those who fulfil their trusts and covenants,
Who uphold their testimonies,
And those who are mindful of their moral obligations.
They will live in gardens with honour.
What is the matter with unbelievers that they stare at you with fixed gazes and hasten towards you
In crowds, right and left?
Does every one of them wish to enter the garden of tranquility?
Never so.
We have created them from what they know.
So I swear by the Lord of the Easts and the Wests that We are certainly able
To bring better people than they in their place; and they will not be able to thwart Us.
So leave them to their vain disputes and amusement till they meet their day (of reckoning) promised them,
The day when they will come out of their graves in all haste as though rushing to their altars,
Eyes lowered, shame attending.
That is the day they have been promised!
SENT NOAH to his people to warn them before the painful punishment came upon them.
He said: "O my people, I warn you clearly
That you should worship God and fear Him, and follow me
That He may forgive some of your sins and prolong your term till an appointed time.
Surely when God's appointed time is come it will not be put off, if only you knew!
He said: "O Lord, I called my people night and day,
But the more I called, they only ran the farther away.
And every time I called them that You may forgive them, they thrust their fingers into their ears, and covered themselves with their garments, and became wayward, and behaved with downright insolence.
Then I called them loudly and more openly,
And declared to them in public and in private,
And I told them: 'Ask your Lord to forgive you. He is verily forgiving.
He will send you abundant rain from the sky,
And will give you increase of wealth and sons, and give you gardens and springs of water.
What has come upon you that you do not fear the majesty of God,
Knowing that He has created you by various stages?
Do you not see how God has fashioned seven skies one above the other,
And has placed the moon therein, an illumination, and has placed the sun, a lighted lamp?
God produced you from the earth like a vegetable growth;
He will then return you back to it, and bring you out again.
God has made the earth for you a spreading,
So that you may walk upon its spacious paths.'
But they did not listen to me," Noah said, "and followed him whose wealth and children only added to his ruin.
And they contrived a plot of great magnitude,
And said: 'Do not abandon your gods, and do not abandon Wadda or Suwa', or Yaghuth, Ya'uq or Nasr.'
And they misled many. So do not give the evil-doers increase but in error.
They were drowned because of their habitual sinfulness, and sent to Hell, and did not find any helper other than God.
Noah said: "O Lord, do not leave a single habitation of unbelievers on the earth.
If you leave them, they will lead Your creatures astray, and beget but iniquitous and ungrateful offspring.
O Lord, forgive me, my parents, and any one who enters my house as a believer, and all believing men and women, and do not give the evil-doers increase save in ruin.
SAY: "I HAVE been informed that a number of jinns had listened; then said: 'We have heard the wondrous Qur'an,
Which guides to the right path; and we have come to believe in it, and will not associate any one with our Lord.
Exalted is the glory of our Lord; He has neither wife nor son.
Certainly the foolish among us say preposterous things of God.
We had in fact thought that men and jinns would never speak a lie about God,
But some men used to seek refuge with some jinns, and this increased their waywardness;
So they began to think, even as you do, that God would not resurrect any one.
We sought to pry into the secrets of the heavens, but found it full of fierce guards and shooting flames.
We sat in observatories to listen; but any one who listened found a shooting star in wait for him.
We do not know if this means ill for the dwellers of the earth, or their Lord wishes guidance for them.
For some of us are upright and some otherwise: Surely we follow different ways.
We realised that we could not weaken the power of God on earth, nor outpace Him by running away.
So when we heard the guidance we believed in it; and he who believes in his Lord will neither fear loss nor force.
Some of us have come to submission, and some of us are iniquitous.'"
Those who have submitted have taken the right course;
But those who are iniquitous will be fuel for Hell.
(Say): "If they keep to the right path We shall give them water in abundance to drink
In order to try them through it.
But whoever turns away from the remembrance of his Lord, will be given increasing torment by Him."
All places of worship are for God; so do not invoke any one with God.
When the devotee of God stood up to invoke Him (the jinns) crowded upon him (to listen).
Say: "I call on my Lord alone and I do not associate any one with Him."
Say: "Neither is your loss within my power nor bringing you to guidance."
Say: "No one can save me from God, nor can I find a place of refuge apart from Him,
Unless I convey from God and deliver His message." For those who disobey God and His Apostle is the fire of Hell, where they will abide for ever;
Until they see what they are promised, when they will understand who is weaker in aid and poorer in numbers.
Say: "I do not know if what is promised you is near, or if my Lord prolongs its term.
He is the knower of the Unknown, and He does not divulge His secret to any one
Other than an apostle He has chosen, when He makes a sentinel walk in front of him and a sentinel behind,
So that He may know if they have delivered their Lord's messages.
He comprehends all that has been given them, and keeps count of everything.
O YOU ENWRAPPED in the cloak (of Prophethood),
Keep watch all the night except some,
A half of it or a little less
Or a little more, and recite the Qur'an slowly and distinctly.
We shall soon entrust to you a message heavy (with solemnity).
Surely in the watches of the night the soul is most receptive and words more telling.
Indeed during the day you have a long schedule of occupations.
But recite the name of your Lord withdrawing yourself from everything, devoting yourself exclusively to Him.
He is the Lord of the East and the West. There is no god but He.
Bear with patience what they say, and gracefully come away from them.
Leave those to Me who deny, the lovers of ease and comfort; and bear with them for a while.
Verily We shall have fetters with Us, and a roaring furnace,
And food that will stick in the throat, and painful torment
On the day the earth and mountains will rock violently, and the mountains turn to a heap of poured-out sand.
We have sent an Apostle to you as a witness against you, as We had sent an apostle to the Pharaoh.
But the Pharaoh disobeyed the apostle; so We seized him with a grievous punishment.
How then, if you disbelieve, will you preserve yourselves on the day which will even turn the children hoary?
The heavens itself will be rent asunder (on that day).
His promise is bound to be fulfilled.
Verily this is a reminder.
So let him who desires take the way to his Lord.
Your Lord surely knows that you are occupied with your devotions for nearly two-thirds of the night, or half the night, or one-third of it, as do many others with you.
Yet God prescribes the measure of night and day.
He knows you cannot calculate it, and so turns to you in benevolence.
So recite as much of the Qur'an as you can easily.
He knows some among you will be sick, and some will be travelling over the earth in search of the bounty of God, and some fighting in the way of God.
So read as much from it as you can easily, and be firm in devotion, pay the zakat, and lend a goodly loan to God.
And what you send for yourself of the good, you will find it with God better and greater in reward.
So ask for God's forgiveness.
Indeed God is forgiving and kind.
O YOU ENFOLDED in your mantle (of reform),
Arise and warn,
Glorify your Lord,
Purify your inner self,
And banish all trepidation.
Do not bestow favours in expectation of return,
And persevere in the way of your Lord.
For when the trumpet blows
It will be a day of distress,
Dolorous for the unbelievers.
Leave him to Me whom I created alone,
And gave him abundant wealth
And sons always present by his side,
And made things easy for them.
Yet he wants that I should give him more.
Never. He is refractory of Our signs.
I shall inflict on him hardship,
For he had thought and calculated.
May he be accursed, how he planned!
May be then be accursed, how he plotted!
Then he looked around,
And frowned and puckered his brow,
Then turned his back and waxed proud,
And said: "This is nothing but the magic of old,
Nothing more than the speech of a man!"
I will cast him into the fire of Hell.
What do you think Hell-fire is?
It leaves nothing, nor does it spare;
It glows and burns the skin.
Over it are nineteen (guards).
We have not appointed any one but angels as keepers of Hell, and their number that We have fixed is to make it a means of contention for disbelievers, so that those who were given the Book may be certain, and the faith of the believers may have greater increase, and the people of the Book and believers may not be deceived, and the sceptics and infidels may say: "What does God mean by this parable?"
That is how God leads whosoever He will astray, and guides whosoever He will.
None knows the armies of your Lord save Him self.
This is no more than reminder for mankind.
I say the truth, and call the moon to witness,
And the night when on the wane,
The morning when it is unveiled,
That (Hell) is surely one of the greater (signs),
A warning for people --
Whoever of you desires to progress or lag behind.
Every soul is pledged to what it does,
Except those of the right hand
Sitting in the gardens, asking
Of evil-doers:
"What was it that brought you to Hell?"
They will answer: "We did not fulfil our devotional obligations,
And did not feed the needy,
And plunged into useless things with those who were obstinate,
And rejected the Day of Judgement as a lie
Until the certainty (of death) had come upon us.
So, the intercession of intercessors will not avail them.
Why then do they turn away from the admonition
As though they were frightened asses
Fleeing from a lion?
In fact every one of them wants to be given open books (like the prophets).
By no means.
In fact they do not fear the Hereafter.
Never so, as this is a reminder.
Let him then who heeds remember it.
But they will not remember except as God wills: He is worthy to be feared, and He is worthy of forgiving
I CALL TO WITNESS the Day of Resurrection,
And I call the reprehensive soul to witness:
Does man think We shall not put his bones together?
Surely We are able to reform even his finger-tips.
Yet man is sceptical of what is right before him.
He asks: "When will the Day of Resurrection be?"
Yet when the eyes are dazzled,
The moon eclipsed,
And the sun and moon are conjoined,
That day man will say: "Where can I find escape?"
Never so, for there will be no escape.
With your Lord alone will be the retreat on that day.
Then man will be told what he had sent ahead (of good) and what he had left behind.
In fact man is a witness against himself,
Whatever the excuses he may offer.
Do not forestall (the revelation before its completion) by acting in haste.
Surely its collection and recitation are Our responsibility.
So, as We recite it, follow its reading.
The exposition of its meaning surely rests on Us.
But no. You love this transient life,
And neglect the Hereafter.
How many faces will be refulgent on that Day,
Waiting for their Lord.
And how many faces on that Day will be woe-begone
Fearing that a great disaster is going to befall them.
Never so, for when life withdraws into the clavicula,
And it is asked: "Is there any reciter of charms and amulets?"
He will then realise it is the parting,
And anguish will be heaped upon anguish:
To your Lord then will be the driving.
For he neither believed nor prayed,
But only disavowed and turned away;
Then he strutted back to his people.
Alas the woe for you, alas!
Alas, the woe for you!
Does man think that he will be left alone to himself, free?
Was he not an emitted drop of semen,
Then formed into an embryo? Then He fashioned, shaped and proportioned
And assigned it sexes, male and female.
Cannot such as He bring the dead to life?
WAS THERE NOT a time in the life of man when he was not even a mentionable thing?
Verily We created man from a sperm yoked (to the ovum) to bring out his real substance, then gave him hearing and sight.
We surely showed him the way that he may either be grateful or deny.
We have prepared for unbelievers chains and collars and a blazing fire.
Surely the devotees will drink cups flavoured with palm blossoms
From a spring of which the votaries of God will drink and make it flow in abundance.
Those who fulfil their vows and fear the Day whose evil shall be diffused far and wide,
And feed the needy for the love of Him, and the orphans and the captives,
(Saying): "We feed you for the sake of God, desiring neither recompense nor thanks.
We fear the dismal day calamitous from our Lord."
So God will protect them from the evil of that day, and grant them happiness and joy,
And reward them for their perseverence Paradise and silken robes,
Where they will recline on couches feeling neither heat of the sun nor intense cold.
The shadows will bend over them, and low will hang the clusters of grapes.
Passed round will be silver flagons and goblets made of glass,
And crystal clear bottles of silver, of which they will determine the measure themselves.
There will they drink a cup flavoured with ginger
From a spring by the name of Ever-flowing-Salsabil.
And boys of everlasting youth will go about attending them.
Looking at them you would think that they were pearls dispersed.
When you look around, you will see delights and great dominion.
On their bodies will be garments of the finest green silk and brocade, and they will be adorned with bracelets of silver; and their Lord will give them a purest draught to drink.
"This in truth is your recompense, and acceptance of your endeavours."
We have revealed the Qur'an to you gradually;
So wait for your Lord's command, and do not follow any sinner or disbeliever among them.
Meditate upon the name of your Lord morning and evening;
And bow in homage part of the night, and glorify Him far into the night.
Surely men love what hastes away and forget the grievous day (ahead).
We created them and fixed their bones and joints; and We could replace them when We like with others like them.
This surely is a reminder: Therefore whosoever desires may take the way to his Lord.
But you will not desire except as God wills.
Verily He is all-knowing and all-wise.
He admits whosoever He will to His benevolence. But for the evil-doers He has prepared a painful punishment.
I CALL TO WITNESS those who are sent consecutively,
And those that strike violently,
And those that revive by quickening,
And those that distinguish distinctly,
And those that bring down the Reminder
To end all argument or to warn.
What is promised will surely come to pass.
When the stars are obliterated,
The heavens split asunder,
The mountains reduced to dust and blown away,
And when the time comes for raising the little girls (buried alive) --
For what day is that time fixed?
The Day of Judgement.
How will you comprehend what the Day of Judgement is?
Alas the woe that day for those who deny!
Have We not destroyed the earlier generations?
So shall We make the later ones to follow them.
That is what We shall do to those who are guilty of crime.
Alas the woe that day for those who deny!
Did We not create you from contemptible water?
Then We lodged you in a secure place (the womb)
For a certain appointed time,
Then We facilitated (your birth).
How well do We calculate!
Alas the woe that day for those who deny!
Have We not made the earth a repository
For the living and the dead,
And placed in it lofty and broad stablisers, and gave you sweet water to drink?
Alas the woe that day for those who deny!
"Go to what you used to deny;
Go to the shadow with three ramifications,
Neither shady nor protecting against the blazing Fire.
It will throw out sparks as logs of wood
So like golden camels."
Alas the woe that day for those who deny!
They will not be able to speak that day,
Nor given leave to make excuses.
Alas the woe that day for those who deny!
That will be the Day of Reckoning.
Gathered will be (you) and the earlier (generations).
So if you have any plot to devise against Me, then devise it.
Alas the woe that day for those who deny!
Those who take heed for themselves and fear God, will be amidst shade and springs of water,
And such fruits as they desire.
"Eat and drink with relish as reward for what you had done."
That is how We reward the good.
Alas the woe that day for those who deny!
Eat and enjoy for a while: You are certainly sinners.
Alas the woe that day for those who deny!
When it is said to them: "Bow in homage," they do not bow.
Alas the woe that day for those who deny!
In what other lore after this will they then believe?
OF WHAT ARE they asking one another?
(Is it) of the great announcement
About which they have been differing?
Indeed they will come to know soon;
They will indeed come to know soon.
Did We not make the earth a spreading,
The mountains tent-pins?
We created you in pairs,
And made sleep for you to rest,
The night a covering,
And the day for seeking livelihood.
We raised over you several secure (skies),
And placed a lamp therein brightly burning.
And We sent down rain from water-laden clouds pouring in torrents
That We may produce from it grain and vegetation,
And orchards full of trees and interlacing boughs.
Surely a time is fixed for the Day of Judgement.
The day the trumpet blast is sounded you will come in hordes;
The heavens will be opened wide and turn into so many doors,
The mountains put in motion turning into a mirage.
Certainly Hell lies in wait,
The rebels' abode,
Where they will remain for aeons,
Finding neither sleep nor any thing to drink
Except boiling water and benumbing cold:
, A fitting reward.
They were those who did not expect a reckoning,
And rejected Our signs as lies.
We have kept account of everything in a book.
So taste (the fruit of what you sowed), for We shall add nothing but torment,
As for those who preserve themselves from evil and follow the straight path, there is attainment for them:
Orchards and vineyards,
And graceful maidens of the same age,
And flasks full and flowing.
They will hear no blasphemies there or disavowals:
A recompense from your Lord, a sufficient gift,
The Lord of the heavens and the earth, and all that lies between them, most benevolent, to whom none may dare address a word.
The day the Spirit takes its stand, with the angels ranged in rows. None will speak except who is permitted by Ar-Rahman and says what is right.
That day is certain.
So whosoever likes may prepare a way to his Lord.
We have indeed warned you of a calamity near at hand, a day when man will see what he had sent (of his deeds) ahead, and the unbeliever will say: "Woe alas. Ah would that I were dust!"
I CALL TO WITNESS those who dive and drag,
And those who undo the bonds gently,
And those who glide swimmingly,
Then outpace the others swiftly
And direct affairs by command,
The day the convulsive (first blast) shatters convulsively
Followed by the second blast,
Hearts will pound loudly on that day,
Eyes be lowered in submission.
They say: "Shall we go back to our original state
After having turned to carious bones?"
They say: "Then this returning will be a dead loss."
It will only be a single blast,
And they will wake up suddenly.
Has the story of Moses come to you
When his Lord called to him in Tuwa's holy vale?
"Go to the Pharaoh who has become refractory,
And say: 'Would you like to grow (in virtue)?
Then I will guide you to your Lord that you may come to fear Him.'"
So he showed him the greater sign;
But (the Pharaoh) disavowed and disobeyed.
Then he turned away, deliberating,
And assembled (his council) and proclaimed,
Saying: "I am alone your lord, the highest of them all."
So God seized him for the punishment of the Hereafter and this world.
Truly there is a lesson in this for those who fear (the consequences).
Are you more difficult to create or the heavens? He built it,
Raised it high, proportioned it,
Gave darkness to its night, and brightness to its day;
And afterwards spread out the earth.
He brought out its water and its pastures from it,
And stabilized the mountains
As convenience for you and your cattle.
When the great calamity comes,
The day when man remembers all that he had done,
And Hell made visible to him who can see,
Then he who had been rebellious
And who preferred the life of the world,
Will surely have Hell for his abode.
But he who feared standing before his Lord, and restrained his self from vain desires,
Will surely have Paradise for abode.
They ask you: "When will the Hour be? When is its time fixed?"
What do you have to do with explaining it?
The extent of its knowledge goes to your Lord.
Your duty is only to warn him who fears it.
The day they see it, it will seem they had stayed in the world but only an evening or its turning into dawn.
HE FROWNED AND turned away,
Because a blind man came to him.
What made you think that he will not grow in virtue,
Or be admonished, and the admonition profit him?
As for him who is not in want of any thing,
You pay full attention,
Though it is not your concern if he should not grow (in fulness).
As for him who comes to you striving (after goodness),
And is also fearful (of God),
You neglect.
Assuredly this is a reminder
For any one who desires to bear it in mind,
(Contained) in honoured pages,
Exalted and holy,
In the hands of scribes
Noble and pious.
Accursed is man.
How ungrateful is he!
Of what substance God created him?
From a single sperm He created, then proportioned him,
Then made his passage easy (at birth);
He will then send him to death and have him laid in the grave.
Then He will raise him up again when He please.
But no. He has not fulfilled what was enjoined on him.
Let man therefore consider (the sources of) his food.
We poured down rain abundantly,
Then We cracked the earth open under pressure (of germination)
And We made corn grow,
And grapes and herbage,
Olives and dates,
Orchards thick with trees,
And fruits and fodder:
A provision for you and your cattle.
But when the great calamity comes
Man will fly from his brother,
Mother and father,
As well as his wife and children.
Each man will have enough cares that day.
Many faces will that day be bright,
Laughing and full of joy,
And many will be dust-begrimed,
Covered with the blackness (of shame):
They will be the unbelievers, transgressors.
WHEN THE SUN is folded up,
The stars turn dim and scatter,
The mountains made to move,
The ten-month pregnant female camels are abandoned,
The wild beasts stampede on the run,
When the oceans surge and swell,
When souls are reunited (with the bodies)
And the little girl buried alive is asked
For what crime she was put to death;
When the ledgers are laid open,
The curtain drawn back from the skies,
When Hell is set ablaze,
And Paradise brought near,
(Then) every soul will know what it had prepared (for itself).
So, I call the receding stars to witness,
The planets withdrawing into themselves,
The closing night,
The rising dawn,
That this is indeed the word of an honoured Messenger,
Full of power, well-established (in position) with the Lord and Master of the Throne,
Obeyed and worthy there of trust.
Your companion is not mad.
He had surely seen Him on the clear horizon.
He is not chary of making public what is unknown.
This is not the utterance of an accursed devil.
So whither do you stray?
This is a reminder for all the peoples of the world,
For those of you who desire to walk the path that is straight,
Though you cannot desire except as God will, the Lord of all the worlds.
WHEN THE SKY is split asunder,
And the stars dispersed,
When the oceans begin to flow,
When the graves are overturned,
Each soul will know what it had sent ahead and what it had left behind.
O man, what seduced you from your munificent Lord
Who created you then formed your symmetry, then gave you right proportion,
Shaping you into any form He pleased?
Even then you deny the Judgement.
Surely there are guardians over you,
Illustrious scribes
Who know what you do.
The pious will surely be in heaven,
The wicked certainly in Hell:
They will burn in it on the Day of Judgement,
And will not be removed from it.
How can you comprehend what the Day of Judgement is?
How then can you comprehend what the Day of Judgement is?
It is the day when no soul will have power to do the least for a soul, and God's alone will be done.
WOE TO THOSE who give short measure,
Who insist on being given full when they take from others,
Whilst when they measure or weigh for them, give less.
Do they not think they will be raised (to life) again
On a grievous day,
The day all mankind will stand before the Lord of all the worlds?
Indeed the ledger of the wicked will be in (the lowest depths) Sijjin.
How will you comprehend what Sijjin is?
It is a (repository of) distinctly written record.
Ah the woe that day for those who deny,
Who call the Day of judgement a lie!
None denies it but the sinful transgressors.
When Our revelations are recited before him, he says: "These are fables of long ago."
No. In fact what they have been doing has rusted their hearts.
Therefore they will be screened off from their Lord that day,
Then they will indeed burn in Hell.
They will then be told: "This is what you had denied."
Surely the ledger of the pious will be in 'Illiyun (heights above the heights).
But how will you comprehend what 'Illiyun is?
It is a (repository of) distinctly written record
Witnessed by those who are honoured.
Verily the pious will be in heaven,
On couches face to face.
On their faces you will see the glow of beatitude.
They will be served the choicest wine, sealed
With a sealing of musk, which those who aspire for the best should desire, --
Blended with the water of Tasnim, (heights ultimate of evolution),
A fountain from which only they who are honoured drink.
The sinners indeed laughed at believers
And winked at one another as they passed by them;
And when they went back to their people turned to make fun of them;
And when they saw them, they said: "They have indeed gone astray."
But they were not Sent to be guardians over them!
So, the believers will laugh at the infidels on that day,
Regarding them from their cushioned seats.
Will not the infidels pay for what they had done?
WHEN THE SKY is cleft asunder,
And hearkens to its Lord and is dutiful,
When the earth is stretched out taut
And throws out whatever it contains and is empty,
And hearkens to its Lord and is dutiful,
O man, you have to strive and go on striving towards your Lord, then will you meet Him.
And he who is given his ledger in his right hand
Will have an easy reckoning,
And will return to his people full of joy.
But he who is given his ledger from behind his back
Will pray for death,
But will be roasted in the fire.
He lived rejoicing among his people,
Never thinking he will return.
Why not? His Lord was always watching him.
So indeed I call to witness the evening twilight,
And the night and all it gathers,
And the moon when at the full,
That you will climb from stage to stage.
So, wherefore do they not believe?
And when the Qur'an is recited to them do not bow in adoration?
In fact the unbelievers disavow.
But God knows what they harbour in their breasts.
So give them news of painful punishment,
Except those who believe and do the right: For them there is reward unending.
I CALL TO witness the sky (bespangled) with the signs of the Zodiac,
And the promised day,
And the witness and the witnessed,
That accursed are the men of the trench
Full of fire fed by faggots,
As they sat around it
Witnessing what they had done to the believers!
They had no other reason for hating them except that they believed in God the mighty, worthy of praise,
Whose kingdom spreads over the heavens and the earth. God is witness over everything.
Surely for those who persecute believers, men and women, and do not repent afterwards, is the punishment of Hell, and the punishment of burning.
Surely for those who believe and do the right are gardens with rivers running by. That is the greatest success.
The grip of your Lord is severe indeed!
It is verily He who initiates and repeats.
He is the forgiving and the loving,
The Lord of the glorious Throne,
Who does as He pleases.
Has the story of the hordes
Of Pharaoh and Thamud come to you?
Yet the infidels persist in denial.
But God surrounds them from all sides.
This is indeed the glorious Qur'an
(Preserved) on the guarded tablet.
I CALL TO witness the heavens and the night Star --
How will you comprehend what the night star is?
It is the star that shines with a piercing brightness --
That over each soul there is a guardian.
Let man consider what he was made of:
He was created of spurting water
Issuing from (the pelvis) between the backbone and the ribs.
God has certainly power to bring him back (from the dead).
The day all secrets are examined
He will have no strength or helper.
So I call to witness the rain-producing sky,
And the earth which opens up (with verdure),
That this (Qur'an) is a decisive word
And no trifle.
They are hatching up a plot,
But I too am devising a plan.
So bear with unbelievers with patience, and give them respite for a while.
GLORIFY THE NAME of your Lord, most high,
Who creates and proportions,
Who determines and directs,
Who brings out the pastures
Then reduces them to rusty rubbish.
We shall make you recite (the Qur'an) so that you will not forget it,
Unless God may please. He knows the visible and knows what is hidden.
We shall take you slowly towards ease.
So remind them if reminder is profitable:
Those who fear will understand.
Only the wretch will turn aside,
Who will burn in the terrible Fire,
In which he will neither die nor live.
Surely he will succeed who grows in goodness,
And recites the name of his Lord and serves with devotion.
But no, you prefer the life of the world,
Though the life to come is better and abiding.
This is surely in the earlier Books,
The Books of Abraham and Moses.
HAS NEWS OF the Overpowering Event reached you?
Many faces will be contrite on that day,
Labouring, wearied out,
Burning in the scorching fire,
Given water from the boiling spring to drink.
They will have no food except bitter thorn,
Neither nourishing nor banishing hunger.
Many faces will be joyous on that day,
Well-pleased with their endeavour,
In the high empyrean,
Never hearing idle talk.
There is a stream of running water in it;
And within it are couches placed on high,
Goblets set,
Cushions arranged,
And rich carpets spread.
Do they not then ponder how the clouds were formed;
And the heavens, how it was raised high;
And the mountains, how they were fixed;
And the earth, how it was spread out?
Remind them; you are surely a reminder.
You are not a warden over them,
Other than him who turns his back and denies,
In which case he will be punished by God with the severest punishment.
To Us is surely their returning;
Ours is surely then to reckon with them.
I CALL TO witness the dawn
And the Ten Nights,
The multiple and the one,
The night as it advances,
Is there not an evidence in this for those who have sense?
Have you not seen what your Lord did to the 'Ad
Of Eram with lofty pillars (erected as signposts in the desert),
The like of whom were never created in the realm;
And with Thamud who carved rocks in the valley;
And the mighty Pharaoh
Who terrorised the region,
And multiplied corruption.
So your Lord poured a scourge of punishment over them.
Your Lord is certainly in wait.
As for man, whenever his Lord tries him and then is gracious and provides good things for him, he says: "My Lord has been gracious to me."
But when He tries him by restraining his means, he says: "My Lord despises me."
No. In fact you are not generous to the orphans,
Nor do you urge one another to feed the poor,
And you devour (others') inheritance greedily,
And love wealth with all your heart.
Surely when We pound the earth to powder grounded, pounded to dust,
And comes your Lord, and angels row on row,
And Hell is brought near, that day will man remember, but of what avail will then remembering be?
He will say: "Alas the woe! Would that I had sent ahead something in my life."
None can punish as He will punish on that day,
And none can bind as He will bind.
O you tranquil soul,
Return to your Lord, well-pleased and well-pleasing Him.
"Enter then among My votaries,
Enter then My garden."
I CALL THIS earth to witness --
And you are free to live upon it, --
And the parent and the offspring,
That We created man in toil and trouble.
Does he think that no one has power over him?
He says: "I have wasted a great deal of wealth."
Does he think that no one sees him?
Did We not give him two eyes,
One tongue, and two lips,
And showed him two highways (of good and evil)?
But he could not scale the steep ascent.
How will you comprehend what the Steep ascent is? --
To free a neck (from the burden of debt or slavery),
Or to feed in times of famine
The orphan near in relationship,
Or the poor in distress;
And to be of those who believe, and urge upon one another to persevere, and urge upon each other to be kind.
They are the people of the right hand (and will succeed).
But those who deny Our revelations are the people of the left hand:
The Fire will vault them over.
I CALL TO witness the sun and his early morning splendour,
And the moon as she follows in his wake,
The day when it reveals his radiance,
The night when it covers him over,
The heavens and its architecture,
The earth and its spreading out,
The soul and how it was integrated
And given the faculty of knowing what is disruptive and what is intrinsic to it.
He who nourishes it will surely be successful,
And he who confines it will surely come to grief.
The Thamud denied (the truth) in their perverseness
When among them the great wretch arose,
And the apostle of God had to tell them: "This is God's she-camel, let her drink."
But they called him a liar and hamstrung her. So God obliterated them for their crime, and (destroyed) all of them alike.
He does not fear the consequence.
I CALL THE night to witness when it covers over,
And the day when it shines in all its glory,
And Him who created the male and female,
That your endeavour is for different ends.
Yet he who gives to others and has fear,
And affirms goodness,
We shall ease the way of fortune for him.
But he who does not give and is unconcerned,
And rejects goodness,
For him We shall ease the way of adversity,
And his riches will not avail him when he falls headlong (into the Abyss).
It is indeed for Us to show the way,
And to Us belong the End and the Beginning.
So, I warn you of the blazing Fire.
No one will burn in it but the most wretched,
Who denied (the truth) and turned away.
But save him who fears
And gives of his wealth that he may grow in virtue,
And is under no one's obligation to return his favour,
Other than seeking the glory of his Lord, most high,
Will surely be gratified.
I CALL TO witness the early hours of morning,
And the night when dark and still,
Your Lord has neither left you, nor despises you.
What is to come is better for you than what has gone before;
For your Lord will certainly give you, and you will be content.
Did He not find you an orphan and take care of you?
Did He not find you perplexed, and show you the way?
Did He not find you poor and enrich you?
So do not oppress the orphan,
And do not drive the beggar away,
And keep recounting the favours of your Lord.
HAVE WE NOT opened up your breast
And removed your burden
Which had left you devoid of hope,
And exalted your fame?
Surely with hardship there is ease.
With hardship indeed there is ease.
So when you are free work diligently,
And turn to your Lord with all your love.
I CALL TO witness the Fig and the Olive,
The Mount Sinai,
And this Soil Secure,
That We created man of finest possibilities,
Then brought him down to the lowest of the low,
Except those who believe and do the right, for whom there is reward undiminished.
Who should then make you deny the Judgement after this?
Is not God the most equitable of all judges?
READ IN THE name of your Lord who created,
Created man from an embryo;
Read, for your Lord is most beneficent,
Who taught by the pen,
Taught man what he did not know.
And yet, but yet man is rebellious,
For he thinks he is sufficient in himself.
Surely your returning is to your Lord.
Have you seen him who restrains
A votary when he turns to his devotions?
Have you thought, if he had been on guidance
Or had enjoined piety, (it would have been better)?
Have you thought that if he denies and turns away,
Does he not know that God sees?
And yet indeed if he does not desist We shall drag him by the forelock,
By the lying, the sinful forelock.
So let him call his associates,
We shall call the guards of Hell.
Beware! Do not obey him, but bow in adoration and draw near (to your Lord).
TRULY WE REVEALED it on the Night of Determination.
How will you know what the Night of Determination is?
Better is the Night of Determination than a thousand months.
On (this night) the angels and grace descend by the dispensation of their Lord, for settling all affairs.
It is peace till the dawning of the day.
THOSE AMONG THE people of the Book who disbelieve, and the idolaters, would not have been freed (from false beliefs) until the clear proof came to them --
An Apostle from God, reading out hallowed pages
Containing firm decrees.
The people of the Book were not divided among themselves till after the clear proof had come to them.
They were commanded only to serve God with all-exclusive faith in Him, to be upright, and to fulfil their devotional obligations, and to give zakat; for this is the even way.
Surely the unbelievers among the people of the Book and the idolaters, will abide in the fire of Hell. They are the worst of creatures.
But those who believe and do the right are surely the best of created beings,
Whose reward is with their Lord -- gardens of Eden with rivers flowing by, where they will abide for ever, God pleased with their service, they with obedience to Him.
This (awaits) him who stands in awe of his Lord.
WHEN THE WORLD is shaken up by its cataclysm,
And the earth throws out its burdens,
And man enquires: "What has come over it?"
That day it will narrate its annals,
For your Lord will have commanded it.
That day people will proceed separately to be shown their deeds.
Whosoever has done even an atom's weight of good will behold it;
And whosoever has done even an atom's weight of evil will behold that.
I CALL TO witness the chargers, snorting, rushing to battle before the others,
Then those striking sparks of fire,
Then those charging in the morning
Raising clouds of dust,
Penetrating deep into the armies,
That man is ungrateful to his Lord
And is himself witness to it,
And is intractable in his love of worldly goods.
Does he not know when the contents of the graves are laid bare
And the secrets of the hearts exposed,
Surely their Lord will be aware of their (deeds).
THE STARTLING CALAMITY.
What is the startling calamity?
How will you comprehend what the startling calamity is? --
A Day on which human beings would be like so many scattered moths,
The mountains like the tufts of carded wool.
Then he whose deeds shall weigh heavier in the scale
Will have a tranquil life;
But he whose deeds are lighter in the balance
Will have the Abyss for abode.
How will you comprehend what that is?
It is the scorching fire.
THE AVARICE OF plenitude keeps you occupied
Till you reach the grave.
But you will come to know soon; --
Indeed you will come to know soon.
And yet if you knew with positive knowledge
You have indeed to behold Hell;
Then you will see it with the eye of certainty.
Then on that day you will surely be asked about the verity of pleasures.
TIME AND AGE are witness
Man is certainly loss,
Except those who believe, and do good and enjoin truth on one another, and enjoin one another to bear with fortitude (the trials that befall).
WOE TO EVERY slanderer, back-biter,
Who amasses wealth and hordes it.
Does he think his wealth will abide for ever with him?
By no means.
He will be thrown into Hutama.
How will you comprehend what Hutama is?
It is the fire kindled by God
Which penetrates the hearts
(And) vaults them over
In extending columns.
HAVE YOU NOT seen how your Lord dealt with the people of the elephants?
Did He not make their plan go wrong,
And sent hordes of chargers flying against them,
(While) you were pelting them with stones of porphyritic lava,
And turned them into pastured fields of corn?
SINCE THE QURAISH have been united,
United to fit out caravans winter and summer,
Let them worship the Lord of this House,
Who provided them against destitution and gave them security against fear.
HAVE YOU SEEN him who denies the Day of Judgement?
It is he who pushes the orphan away,
And does not induce others to feed the needy.
Woe to those who pray
But who are oblivious of their moral duties,
Who dissimulate
And withhold things of common use (from others).
HAVE SURELY given you pre-eminence (in numbers and following);
So serve your Lord with full dedication and sacrifice.
It is surely your opponents whose line will come to end.
SAY: "O YOU unbelievers,
I do not worship what you worship,
Nor do you worship who I worship,
Nor will I worship what you worship,
Nor will you worship who I worship:
To you your way, to me my way
WHEN THE HELP of God arrives and victory,
And you see men enter God's discipline horde on horde,
Then glorify your Lord and seek His forgiveness.
Verily He is relenting.
DESTROYED WILL BE the hands of Abu Lahab, and he himself will perish.
Of no avail shall be his wealth, nor what he has acquired.
He will be roasted in the fire,
And his wife, the portress of fire wood,
Will have a strap of fibre rope around her neck.
SAY: "HE IS God the one the most unique,
God the immanently indispensable.
He has begotten no one, and is begotten of none.
There is no one comparable to Him."
SAY: "I SEEK refuge with the Lord of rising day
From the evil of what He has created,
And the evil of evening darkness when it overspreads,
From the evil of sorceresses who blow incantations on knots,
From the evil of the envier when he envies.
SAY: "I SEEK refuge with the Lord of men,
The King of men,
The God of men,
From the evil of him who breathes temptations into the minds of men,
Who suggests evil thoughts to the hearts of men --
From among the jinns and men.
Allah - beginning with the name of - the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
All praise is to Allah, the Lord Of The Creation.
The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
Owner of the Day of Recompense
You alone we worship and from You alone we seek help (and may we always).
Guide us on the Straight Path.
The path of those whom You have favoured – Not the path of those who earned Your anger – nor of those who are astray.
Alif-Laam-Meem. (Alphabets of the Arabic language; Allah and to whomever He reveals, know their precise meanings.)
This is the exalted Book (the Qur’an), in which there is no place for doubt; a guidance for the pious.
Those who believe without seeing (the hidden), and keep the (obligatory) prayer established, and spend in Our cause from what We have bestowed upon them.
And who believe in this (Qur’an) which has been sent down upon you, O beloved Prophet, (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) and what was sent down before you; and are certain of the Hereafter.
It is they who are on guidance from their Lord; and they are the successful.
As for those whose fate is disbelief, whether you warn them or do not warn them – it is all one for them; they will not believe. (Because their hearts are sealed – see next verse).
Allah has sealed their hearts and their ears, and on their eyes is a covering; and for them is a terrible punishment.
And among the people are some* that say, “We believe in Allah and the Last Day**” whereas they are not believers! (* The hypocrites ** the Day of Resurrection)
They wish to deceive Allah and the believers; and in fact they deceive none except themselves and they do not have any understanding.
In their hearts is a disease, so Allah has increased their disease; and for them is a painful punishment, because of their lies.
And when it is said to them, “Do not cause turmoil in the earth”, they say, “We are only peacemakers!”
Pay heed! It is they who are mischievous, but they do not have sense.
And when it is said to them, “Believe as the others believe”, they say, “Shall we believe as the foolish believe?”
It is they who are the fools, but they do not know.
And when they meet with the believers, they say, “We believe”; and when they are alone with their devils, they say, “We are undoubtedly with you, we were just mocking!”
Allah (befitting His Majesty) mocks them, leaving them to wander blindly in their rebellion.
These are the people who purchased error in exchange of guidance – so their bargain did not profit them, and they did not know how to trade.
Their example is like that of one who kindled a fire; and when it lit up all that was around it, Allah took away their light and left them in darkness, unable to see anything.
Deaf, dumb and blind; and they are not to return.
Or like a rainstorm from the sky, in which are darkness, thunder and lightning; they thrust their fingers in their ears due to the thunderclaps, fearing death; and Allah has the disbelievers encompassed.
It seems the lightning may snatch away their sight from them; whenever it flashes they walk in it, and when it darkens they stand still; if Allah willed, He could take away their hearing and their sight; indeed Allah is Able to do all things.
O mankind! Worship your Lord, Who has created you and those before you, in the hope of attaining piety.
The One Who has appointed the earth a base for you, and the sky a canopy – and caused water to pour down from the sky, thereby producing fruits as food for you; and do not knowingly set up rivals to Allah!
And if you are in any doubt concerning what We have sent down upon Our distinguished bondman (Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), bring forth a single surah (chapter) equal to it; and call upon all your supporters, other than Allah, if you are truthful.
And if you are unable to bring forth (one chapter) – and We declare that you can never bring one – then fear the fire (of hell), the fuel of which is men and stones; kept ready for the disbelievers.
And give glad tidings to those who believe and do good deeds; that for them are Gardens beneath which rivers flow; when they are provided with a fruit of the Gardens, they will say, “This is the same food as what was given to us before” whereas it is in resemblance; and in the Gardens are pure spouses for them; and they shall abide in it forever.
Indeed Allah does not, for the sake of explanation, shy to illustrate an example of anything, whether it is of a gnat or something further (inferior) than it; so the believers know it is the Truth from their Lord; as for the disbelievers, they say, “What does Allah intend by such an example?” He misleads many thereby, and He guides many thereby; and with it He misleads only those who are rebellious.
Those who break the covenant of Allah after ratifying it – and sever what Allah has ordered to join, and who cause turmoil (evil / religious chaos) in the earth; it is they who are the losers.
What has made you disbelieve in Allah? Whereas you were dead and He gave you life; then He will give you death, then bring you to life again, and then it is to Him you will return!
It is He Who created for you all that is in the earth; then He inclined towards the heaven, therefore fashioning it as proper seven heavens; and He knows everything.
And (remember) when your Lord said to the angels, “I am about to place My Caliph in the earth”; they said, “Will You place (as a caliph) one who will spread turmoil in it and shed blood? Whereas we glorify You with praise and proclaim Your Sanctity”; He said, “I know what you do not.”
And Allah the Supreme taught Adam all the names (of things), then presented them to the angels, saying, “Tell Me the names of these, if you are truthful.”
They said, “Purity is to You!
We do not have any knowledge except what You have taught us! Indeed You only are the All Knowing, the Wise.”
He said “O Adam!
Inform them the names”; and when Adam had informed them their names, He said, “Did I not tell you that I know all the secrets of the heavens and the earth? And I know all what you disclose and all what you hide?”
And (remember) when We ordered the angels to prostrate before Adam, so they all prostrated, except Iblis (Satan – devil); he refused and was proud – and became a disbeliever.
And We said, “O Adam! You and your wife dwell in this Garden, and eat freely from it wherever you please – but do not approach this tree for you will become of those who transgress.”
So the devil destabilised them in it and removed them from where they were – and We said, “Go down, one of you is an enemy to the other; and for a fixed time you shall stay on earth and feed in it.”
Then Adam learnt from his Lord certain words (of revelation), therefore Allah accepted his repentance; indeed He only is the Most Acceptor of Repentance, the Most Merciful. (See Verse 7:23)
We said, “Go down from Paradise, all of you; then if some guidance comes to you from Me – so whoever follows My guidance, for such is neither fear nor any grief.”
And those who disbelieve and deny Our signs, are the people of fire (hell); they will remain in it forever.
O Descendants of Israel (Jacob)!
Remember My favour which I bestowed upon you, and fulfil your covenant towards Me, I shall fulfil My covenant towards you; and fear Me alone.
And accept faith in what I have sent down (the Qur’an), which confirms what is with you (the Torah / Bible), and do not be the first to disbelieve in it – and do not exchange My verses for an abject – and fear Me alone.
And do not mix the truth with falsehood, nor purposely conceal the truth.
And keep the (obligatory) prayer established, and pay the charity, and bow your heads with those who bow (in prayer).
What! You enjoin righteousness upon people while you forget (to practise it) yourselves, whereas you read the Book?
Do you not have sense?
And seek help in patience and prayer; and truly it is hard except for those who prostrate before Me with sincerity.
Who know that they have to meet their Lord, and that it is to Him they are to return.
O Descendants of Israel!
Remember the favour of Mine, which I bestowed upon you and gave you superiority over others of your time. (by sending the Noble Messengers to your nation)
And fear the Day (of Resurrection) when no soul will be exchanged for another, nor will any intercession be accepted for the disbelievers, nor will they be set free in lieu of compensation nor will they be helped.
(And remember) When We rescued you from Firaun’s people, for they were inflicting you with a dreadful torment, slaying your sons and sparing your daughters; that was a tremendous trial from your Lord (or a great reward).
And when We split the sea for you thereby rescuing you, and drowned the Firaun's people in front of your eyes.
And when We made a commitment with Moosa (Moses) for forty nights – then behind him you started worshipping the calf, and you were unjust.
Then after that We pardoned you so that you may be grateful.
And when We gave Moosa the Book (Taurat / Torah) and the criterion to judge right from wrong, so that you may attain guidance.
And when Moosa said to his people, “O my people!
You have wronged yourselves by taking the calf,* therefore turn in repentance to your Creator, therefore kill each other; this is better for you before your Creator”; He therefore accepted your repentance; indeed He only is the Most Acceptor of Repentance, the Most Merciful. (* as your deity for worship)
And when you said “O Moosa!
We will not believe you till we clearly see Allah”; so the thunder seized you while you were watching.
Then We brought you back to life after your death, so that you may be grateful.
And We made the clouds a canopy for you and sent down Manna and Salwa (birds) on you; “Eat of the pure things We have provided you”; they did not wrong Us in the least, but indeed they wronged themselves.
And when We said, “Enter this town and eat freely from what is in it, and enter the gate whilst prostrating, and say, ‘May our sins be forgiven’ – We will forgive you your sins; and We will soon increase the reward for the righteous.”
But the unjust changed the word that had been ordered for another one, so We sent down a punishment on them from the skies, the recompense of their disobedience.
And when Moosa asked for water for his people, We said, “Strike this rock with your staff”; thereupon twelve springs gushed forth from it; each group recognised its drinking-place; “Eat and drink from what Allah has provided, and do not roam about the earth making turmoil in it.”
And when you said, “O Moosa!
We shall never put up with only one kind of food, so call upon your Lord to produce for us what the earth grows – some herbs, cucumbers, corn, lentils and onions”; he said, “What!
You wish to exchange the better for something inferior?
Therefore settle down in Egypt or any city, where you will get what you demand”; and disgrace and misery were destined for them; and they returned towards Allah’s wrath; that was because they disbelieved in Allah’s signs and wrongfully martyred the Prophets; that was for their disobedience and transgression.
Indeed the believers (the Muslims) and those among the Jews, the Christians, and the Sabeans who sincerely accept faith in Allah and the Last Day* and do good deeds – their reward is with their Lord; and there shall be no fear upon them nor shall they grieve. (* i.e. convert to Islam)
And when We made a covenant with you and raised the Mount above you; “Accept and hold fast to what We give you, and remember what is in it, so that you may attain piety.”
Then after that, you turned away; and were it not for the munificence of Allah and His mercy, you would be among the losers.
And you certainly know of those amongst you who transgressed in the matter of Sabth (Sabbath – Saturday) – We therefore said to them, “Become apes, despised!”
So We made this incident (of that town) a warning to the surrounding towns (others of their time) and to succeeding generations, and a lesson for the pious.
And (remember) when Moosa said to his people, “Allah commands you to sacrifice a cow”; they said, “Are you making fun of us?”
He answered, “Allah forbid that I should be of the ignorant!”
They said, “Pray to your Lord that He may describe the cow”; said Moosa, “He says that it is a cow neither old nor very young but between the two conditions; so do what you are commanded.”
They said, “Pray to your Lord that He may reveal its colour to us”; answered Moosa, “Indeed He says it is a yellow cow, of bright colour, pleasing to the beholders.”
They said, “Pray to your Lord that He may clearly describe the cow to us, we are really in a doubt as to which cow it is; and if Allah wills, we will attain guidance.”
Said Moosa, “He says, ‘She is a cow not made to work, neither ploughing the soil nor watering the fields; flawless and spotless’; they said, “You have now conveyed the proper fact”; so they sacrificed it, but seemed not to be sacrificing it (with sincerity).
And (remember) when you slew a man and were therefore accusing each other concerning it; and Allah wanted to expose what you were hiding.
We therefore said, “Strike the dead man with a part of the sacrificed cow”; this is how Allah will bring the dead to life, and shows you His signs so that you may understand!
Then after it, your hearts hardened – so they are like rocks, or even harder; for there are some rocks that rivers gush forth from them; and some that water flows from them when they split asunder; and there are rocks that fall down for the fear of Allah; and Allah is not unaware of your deeds.
So O Muslims, do you wish for the Jews to accept faith in you whereas a group of them used to listen to the Words of Allah, and then after having understood it, purposely changed it?
And when they meet the believers, they say, “We believe”; but when they are in isolation with one another they say, “You clarify to the believers from what Allah has disclosed to you, so that they may evidence it against you before your Lord?
So have you no sense?”
Do they not know that Allah knows all whatever they hide and whatever they disclose?
And among them are the unlearned that do not know anything of the Book except to recite something therefrom or parts of their own fabrications; they are in absolute illusion.
Therefore woe is to those who write the Book with their hands; and they then claim, “This is from Allah” in order to gain an abject (worldly) price for it; therefore woe to them for what their hands have written, and woe to them for what they earn with it.
And they said, “The fire will not touch us except for a certain number of days”; say, “Have you taken a covenant from Allah – then Allah will certainly not break His covenant – or do you say something concerning Allah what you do not know?”
Yes, why not?* The one who earns evil and his sin surrounds him; he is from the people of fire (hell); they will remain in it forever.
(You will remain in the fire forever).
And those who believe and do good deeds – they are the People of Paradise; they will abide in it forever.
And (remember) when We took a covenant from the Descendants of Israel that, “Do not worship anyone except Allah; and be good to parents, relatives, orphans and the needy, and speak kindly to people and keep the prayer established and pay the charity”; thereafter you retracted, except some of you; and you are those who turn away.
And when We took a covenant from you that, “Do not shed the blood of your own people nor turn out your own people from your colonies”; you then acknowledged it and you are witnesses.
Then it is you who began slaying each other and you drive out a group of your people from their homeland – providing support against them (to their opponents) through sin and injustice; and if they come to you as captives you redeem them, whereas their expulsion itself is forbidden to you; so do you believe in some of Allah’s commands and disbelieve in some?
So what is the reward of those who do so, except disgrace in this world?
And on the Day of Resurrection they will be assigned to the most grievous punishment; and Allah is not unaware of your deeds.
These are the people who bought the worldly life in exchange of the Hereafter – so their punishment will not be lightened, nor will they be helped.
And indeed We gave Moosa (Moses) the Book and subsequent to him, sent Noble Messengers one after another – and We gave Eisa (Jesus), the son of Maryam (Mary), clear proofs and supported him with the Holy Spirit; so when a Noble Messenger from Allah comes to you bringing what you yourselves do not desire, you grow arrogant; so you disbelieve in a group of the Prophets and another group of Prophets you slay!
And the Jews said, “Our hearts are covered”; in fact Allah has cursed them because of their disbelief, so only a few of them accept faith.
And when the Book from Allah (the Holy Qu’ran) came to them, which confirms the Book in their possession (the Taurat / Torah) – and before that they used to seek victory through the medium of this very Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) over the disbelievers; so when the one whom they fully recognised (the Holy Prophet) came to them, they turned disbelievers – therefore Allah’s curse is upon the disbelievers.
How abject is the price for which they exchange their lives that they should disbelieve in what Allah has sent down, jealous that Allah should reveal of His grace to whomever He wills of His bondmen!
So they deserved wrath upon wrath; and for the disbelievers is a disgraceful punishment.
And when it is said to them, “Believe in what Allah has sent down", they say, “We believe in what was sent down to us, and disbelieve in the rest” – whereas it is the Truth confirming what they possess! Say (to them, O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “Why did you then martyr the earlier Prophets, if you believed in your Book?”
And indeed Moosa came to you with clear signs, and after it you worshipped the calf – and you were unjust.
And remember when We made a covenant with you and raised the Mount Tur (Sinai) above you; “Accept and hold fast to what We give you, and listen”; they said, “We hear and we disobey”; and the calf was still embedded in their hearts because of their disbelief; say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “What an evil command is what your faith orders you, if you are believers!”
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “If the abode of the Hereafter in the sight of Allah is for you alone and none else, then long for death if you are truthful!”
And they will never long for it, because of the evil deeds they have done in the past; and Allah knows the unjust, very well.
And you will surely find them the greediest among mankind for life; and (likewise) among the polytheists (idolaters); each one of them yearns to live a thousand years; and the grant of such age will not distance him from the punishment; and Allah is seeing their misdeeds.
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “Whoever is an enemy to Jibreel (Gabriel)” – for it is he who has brought down this Qu’ran to your heart by Allah’s command, confirming the Books before it, and a guidance and glad tidings to Muslims. –
“Whoever is an enemy to Allah, and His angels and His Noble Messengers, and Jibreel and Mikaeel (Michael) -, then (know that), Allah is an enemy of the disbelievers.”
We have indeed sent down to you clear signs; and none will disbelieve in them except the sinners.
And is it that whenever they make a covenant, only a group of them throws it aside?
In fact, most of them do not have faith.
And when a Noble Messenger from Allah came to them, confirming the Book(s) which they possessed, a group of those who have received the Book(s) flung the Book of Allah behind their backs as if they were totally unaware!
And they followed what the devils used to read during the rule of Sulaiman (Solomon – peace and blessings be upon him); and Sulaiman did not disbelieve, but the devils disbelieved – they teach people magic; and that which was sent down to the two angels, Harut and Marut in Babylon; and the two (angels) never taught a thing to anyone until they used to say, “We are only a trial, therefore do not lose your faith” and they used to learn from them that by which they cause division between man and his wife; and they cannot harm anyone by it except by Allah’s command; and they learn what will harm them, not benefit them; and surely they know that whoever bargains for this will not have a share in the Hereafter; and for what an abject thing they have sold themselves; if only they knew!
And had they believed and been pious, then the recompense from Allah is extremely good; if only they knew!
O People who Believe, do not say (to the Prophet Mohammed- peace and blessings be upon him), “Raena (Be considerate towards us)” but say, “Unzurna (Look mercifully upon us)", and listen attentively from the start; and for the disbelievers is a painful punishment. (To disrespect the Holy Prophet – peace and blessings be upon him – is blasphemy.)
Those who disbelieve – the People given the Book(s) or the polytheists – do not wish that any good be sent down upon you from your Lord; and Allah chooses whomever He wills by His Mercy; and Allah is the Most Munificent.
When We abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten, We will bring one better than it or one similar; do you not know that Allah is Able to do all things?
Do you not know that for Allah only is the kingship of the heavens and the earth?
And except Allah, you have neither a protector nor any supporter?
Do you wish to ask your Noble Messenger a question similar to what Moosa was asked before?
And whoever chooses disbelief instead of faith has gone astray from the Right Path.
Many among People given the Book(s) wished to turn you to disbelief after you had accepted faith; out of hearts’ envy, after the truth has become very clear to them; so leave them and be tolerant, until Allah brings His command; indeed Allah is Able to do all things.
And keep the prayer established, and pay the charity; and whatever good you send ahead for yourselves, you will find it with Allah; indeed Allah is seeing your deeds.
And the People given the Book(s) said, “None will enter Paradise unless he is a Jew or a Christian”; these are their own imaginations; say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “Bring your proof, if you are truthful.”
Yes, why not? Whoever submits his face for the sake of Allah, and is virtuous, his reward is with his Lord; and there shall be no fear upon them nor shall they grieve.
And the Jews said, “The Christians are nothing” – and the Christians said, “The Jews are nothing” whereas they both read the Book; and the ignorant spoke similarly; so Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection, concerning the matter in which they dispute.
And who is more unjust than one who prevents the name of Allah being mentioned in the mosques, and strives for their ruin?
It did not befit them to enter the mosques except in fear; for them is disgrace in this world, and a terrible punishment in the Hereafter.
And the East and the West, all belong to Allah – so whichever direction you face, there is Allah’s Entity (Allah’s Mercy is directed towards you); indeed Allah is the All Capable, (His powers and reach are limitless), the All Knowing.
And they said, “Allah has taken an offspring for Himself” – Purity is to Him!
In fact, all that is in the heavens and the earth, is His dominion; all are submissive to Him.
The Originator of the heavens and the earth – and when He commands a thing, He only says to it, “Be", and it thereupon happens.
And the ignorant people said, “Why does not Allah speak to us, or some sign come to us?”
Those before them had also spoken in the same way as they speak; their hearts (and of those before them) are all alike; undoubtedly, We have made the signs clear for the people who have faith.
Undoubtedly, We have sent you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) with the truth, giving glad tidings and conveying warning, and you will not be questioned about the people of hell.
And never will the Jews or the Christians be pleased with you, until you follow their religion; say, “The guidance of Allah only is the (true) guidance”; and were you (the followers of this Prophet) to follow their desires after the knowledge has come to you, you would then not have a protector or aide against Allah.
Those to whom We have given the Book, read it in the manner it should be read; it is they who believe in it; and those who deny it – it is they who are the losers.
O Descendants of Israel!
Remember the favour of Mine which I bestowed upon you and made you superior to all others of your time. (By sending Noble Messengers among you).
And fear the day when no soul will be exchanged for another, nor will they be set free in lieu of compensation, nor will any intercession benefit the disbelievers, nor will they be helped.
And (remember) when Ibrahim’s (Abraham’s) Lord tested him in some matters and he fulfilled them; He said, “I am going to appoint you as a leader for mankind”; invoked Ibrahim, “And of my offspring”; He said, “My covenant does not include the unjust (wrong-doers).”
And remember when We made this House (at Mecca) a recourse for mankind and a sanctuary; and take the place where Ibrahim stood, as your place of prayer; and We imposed a duty upon Ibrahim and Ismail (Ishmael), to fully purify My house for those who go around it, and those who stay in it (for worship), and those who bow down and prostrate themselves.
And (remember) when Ibrahim prayed, “My Lord! Make this city a place of security and bestow upon its people various fruits as providence – for those among them who believe in Allah and the Last Day (of Resurrection)”; He answered, “And whoever disbelieves, I shall provide him also some subsistence and then compel him towards the punishment of fire (hell); and that is a wretched place to return.”
And (remember) when Ibrahim was raising the foundations of the House, along with Ismail; (saying), “Our Lord! Accept it from us; indeed You only are the All Hearing, the All Knowing.”
“Our Lord! And make us submissive towards you and from our offspring a nation obedient to You – and show us the ways of our worship, and incline towards us with Your mercy; indeed You only are the Most Acceptor of Repentance, the Most Merciful.”
And send towards them a Noble Messenger, from amongst them, to recite to them Your verses, and to instruct them in Your Book and sound wisdom*, and to fully purify them; indeed You only are the Almighty, the Wise.” (The traditions of the Holy Prophet – sunnah and hadith – are called wisdom.)
And who will renounce the religion of Ibrahim except him who is a fool at heart?
We indeed chose him (Ibrahim) in this world; and indeed in the Hereafter he is among those worthy of being closest to Us.
When his Lord said to him, “Submit”, he said, “I have submitted to the Lord Of The Creation.”
And Ibrahim willed the same religion upon his sons, and also did Yaqub (Jacob); (saying), “O my sons – indeed Allah has chosen this religion for you; therefore do not die except as Muslims (those who submit to Him).”
In fact, some of you yourselves were present when death approached Yaqub and when he said to his sons, “What will you worship after me?” They said, “We shall worship Him Who is your God, and is the God of your fathers, Ibrahim and Ismail and Ishaq (Isaac) – the One God; and to Him we have submitted ourselves.”
This was a nation that has passed away; for them is what they earned, and yours is what you earn; and you will not be questioned about their deeds.
And the People given the Book(s) said, “Become Jews or Christians – you will attain the right path”; say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “No – rather we take the religion of Ibrahim, who was far removed from all falsehood; and was not of the polytheists.”
Say, “We believe in Allah and what is sent down to us and what was sent down to Ibrahim, and Ismael, and Ishaq, and Yaqub, and to their offspring, and what was bestowed upon Moosa and Eisa (Jesus), and what was bestowed upon other Prophets – from their Lord; we do not make any distinction, in belief, between any of them; and to Allah we have submitted ourselves.”
And if they believe in the same way you have believed, they have attained guidance; and if they turn away, they are clearly being stubborn; so Allah will soon suffice you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) against them; and He only is the All Hearing, the All Knowing.
“We have taken the colour (religion) of Allah; and whose colour (religion) is better than that of Allah?
And only Him do we worship.”
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “What! You dispute with us concerning Allah, whereas He is our Lord and also yours?
Our deeds are with us and with you are your deeds; and only to Him do we sincerely belong.”
“In fact you claim that Ibrahim, and Ismail, and Ishaq, and Yaqub, and their offspring were Jews or Christians”; say, “Do you know better, or does Allah?”; and who is more unjust than one who has the testimony from Allah and he hides it?
And Allah is not unaware of your deeds.
They were a group that has passed away; for them is what they earned, and for you is what you earn; and you will not be questioned about their deeds.
So now the foolish people will say, “What has turned the Muslims away from the qiblah (prayer direction) which they formerly observed?”; proclaim, “To Allah only belong the East and the West; He guides whomever He wills upon the Straight Path.”
And so it is that We have made you the best nation* for you are witnesses** against mankind, and the Noble Messenger is your guardian and your witness; and (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) We had appointed the qiblah which you formerly observed only to see (test) who follows the Noble Messenger, and who turns away; and it was indeed hard except for those whom Allah guided; and it does not befit Allah’s Majesty to waste your faith!
Indeed Allah is Most Compassionate, Most Merciful towards mankind. (* The best Ummah is that of Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him. ** The Holy Prophet is a witness from Allah.)
We observe you turning your face, several times towards heaven (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him); so We will definitely make you turn (for prayer) towards a qiblah which pleases you; therefore now turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque (in Mecca); and O Muslims, wherever you may be, turn your faces (for prayer) towards it only; and those who have received the Book surely know that this is the truth from their Lord; and Allah is not unaware of their deeds.
(Allah seeks to please the Holy Prophet – peace and blessings be upon him.)
And even if you were to bring all the signs to the People given the Book(s), they would not follow your qiblah; nor should you follow their qiblah; nor do they follow each others qiblah; and were you (the followers of this Prophet) to follow their desires after having received knowledge, you would then surely be unjust.
Those to whom We gave the Book(s) recognise the Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) as men (or they) recognise their own sons; and undoubtedly a group among them purposely conceals the truth.
This is the Truth from your Lord, therefore (O those who listen) beware – do not be in doubt.
And each one has a direction towards which he inclines, therefore strive to surpass others in good deeds; Allah will bring you all together, wherever you may be; indeed Allah may do as He wills.
And wherever you come from, turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque; and indeed it is the truth from your Lord; and Allah is not unaware of your deeds.
And O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) wherever you come from, turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque; and wherever you may be, O Muslims, turn your faces towards it only, so that people may not have an argument against you – except those among them who do injustice; therefore do not fear them, and fear Me; and this is in order that I complete My favour upon you and that you may attain guidance. –
The way We have sent to you a Noble Messenger from among you, who recites to you Our verses and purifies you, and teaches you the Book and sound wisdom*, and teaches you what you did not know. (The traditions / sayings of the Holy Prophet – peace and blessings be upon him).
Therefore remember Me, I will cause you to be spoken of and acknowledge My rights, and do not be ungrateful.
O People who Believe! Seek help from patience and prayer; indeed Allah is with those who patiently endure.
And do not utter regarding those who are slain in Allah's cause as “dead”; in fact they are alive, but it is you who are unaware.
And We will surely test you with some fear and hunger, and with paucity of wealth and lives and crops; and give glad tidings to those who patiently endure. –
Those who say when calamity befalls them, “Indeed we belong to Allah and indeed it is to Him we are to return.”
These are the people upon whom are the blessings from their Lord, and mercy; and it is they who are on guidance.
Undoubtedly Safa and Marwah* are among the symbols of Allah; so there is no sin on him, for whoever performs the Hajj (pilgrimage) of this House (of Allah) or the Umrah (lesser pilgrimage), to go back and forth between them; and whoever does good of his own accord, then (know that) indeed Allah is Most Appreciative (rewards virtue), the All Knowing. (These are 2 hillocks near the Holy Ka’aba)
Indeed those who hide the clear proofs and the guidance which We sent down, after We made it clear to mankind in the Book – upon them is the curse of Allah and the curse of those who curse.
Except those who repent and do reform and disclose (the truth) – so I will accept their repentance; and I only am the Most Acceptor of Repentance, the Most Merciful.
Indeed upon those who disbelieved, and died as disbelievers, is the curse of Allah and of the angels and of men combined.
They will remain in it forever; neither will the punishment be lightened for them, nor will they be given respite.
Your God is One God; there is no God except Him – the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Indeed in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the continuous alternation of night and day, and the ships which sail the seas carrying what is of use to men, and the water which Allah sends down from the sky thereby reviving the dead earth and dispersing all kinds of beasts in it, and the movement of the winds, and the obedient clouds between heaven and earth – certainly in all these are signs for the intelligent.
And some people create for themselves Gods (objects of worship) other than Allah, with devotion (love) equal to the devotion of Allah; and the believers do not love anybody with love equal to the love of Allah; and what will be their state, when the punishment will be before the eyes of the unjust (disbelievers)?
For all power belongs wholly to Allah, and because Allah’s punishment is very severe.
(The day) when the leaders will be disgusted with their followers – and they shall see their punishment, and all their links will be cut off.
And the followers will say, “If we were to return (to earth), we would break off from them like they have broken off from us”; this is how Allah will show them their deeds as despair for them; and they will never come out from the fire (hell).
O mankind! Eat from what is lawful and clean in the earth; and do not follow the footsteps of the devil; undoubtedly he is your open enemy.
For he will only instruct you towards the evil and the shameful, and that you fabricate matters concerning Allah, what you do not know.
And when it is said to them, “Follow what Allah has sent down”, they say, “On the contrary, we shall follow what we found our forefathers upon”; What! Even if their forefathers had no intelligence, or guidance?!
And the example of the disbelievers is similar to one who calls upon one that hears nothing except screaming and yelling; deaf, dumb, blind – so they do not have sense.
O People who Believe! Eat of the good things We have provided you, and be grateful to Allah if it is only Him you worship.
He has forbidden for you only the carrion, and blood, and flesh of swine, and the animal that has been slaughtered while proclaiming the name of anyone other than Allah; so there is no sin on him who is compelled and does not eat out of desire, nor eats more than what is necessary; indeed Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
Those who hide the Book sent down by Allah and exchange it for an abject price – they only fill their bellies with fire and Allah will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection nor will He purify them; and for them is a painful punishment.
They are the people who purchased error in exchange of guidance, and torment in exchange of pardon; so how much can they bear the fire?
This is because Allah has sent down the Book with the truth; and indeed those who caused disagreement in the Book are, surely, disputants in the extreme.
Basic virtue is not just to turn faces to the East and the West, but true righteousness is that one must believe in Allah and the Last Day and the angels and the Book and the Prophets; and out of love for Allah, to give treasured wealth to relatives and to the orphans and the needy and the traveller, and to those who ask, and to set slaves free; and to keep the prayer established and to pay the charity; and those who fulfil their obligations when they make an agreement; and the patient during times of calamity, in hardships and during holy war; it is they who have proved true to their word; it is they who are the pious.
O People who Believe! Retribution is made obligatory for you in the matter of those killed unjustly; a freeman for a freeman, and a slave for a slave, and a female for a female; and for him who is partly forgiven by his brother, seek compensation with courtesy and make payment in proper manner; this is a relief and a mercy upon you, from your Lord; so after this, a painful punishment is for whoever exceeds the limits.
And there is life for you in retribution, O men of understanding, so that you may avoid.
It is ordained for you that when death approaches one of you, and he leaves behind wealth, he must bequeath it to parents and near relatives in accordance with tradition; this is a duty upon the pious.
So whoever changes the will after he has heard it – its sin is only upon those who change it; indeed Allah is the All Hearing, the All Knowing.
Then if one fears that the will maker (the deceased) has done injustice or sin, and he makes a reconciliation between the parties, there shall be no sin upon him; indeed Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
O People who Believe!
Fasting is made compulsory for you, like it was ordained for those before you, so that you may attain piety.
For a certain number of days only; so whoever is sick among you, or on a journey, the same number in other days; and those who do not have the strength for it must give a redemption by feeding a needy person; so whoever increases the good of his own accord, it is better for him; and fasting is better for you, if only you realise.
The month of Ramadan in which was sent down the Qur’an – the guidance for mankind, the direction and the clear criteria (to judge between right and wrong); so whoever among you witnesses this month, must fast for the (whole) month; and whoever is sick or on a journey, may fast the same number in other days; Allah desires ease for you and does not desire hardship for you – so that you complete the count (of fasts), and glorify Allah’s greatness for having guided you, and so that you may be grateful.
And O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), when My bondmen question you concerning Me, then surely I am close; I answer the prayer of the supplicant when he calls on Me, so they must obey Me and believe in Me, so that they may attain guidance.
Going to your wives during the nights of the fast is made lawful for you; they are coverings for you and you are coverings for them; Allah knows that you were deceiving yourselves (in this respect), so He accepted your penance and forgave you; so cohabit with them and seek what Allah has destined for you – and eat and drink until the white thread becomes distinct to you from the black thread at dawn – then complete the fast till nightfall; and do not touch women while staying in seclusion for worship in the mosques; these are the limits imposed by Allah, so do not go near them; this is how Allah explains His verses to mankind so that they may attain piety.
And do not unjustly devour the property of each other, nor take their cases to judges in order that you may wrongfully devour a portion of other peoples’ property on purpose.
They ask you, (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), regarding the crescents; say, “They are indicators of time for mankind and for Hajj (the pilgrimage)”; and it is not a virtue at all that you enter the houses by demolishing their back portions, but in reality virtue is piety; and enter the houses using their gates – and keep fearing Allah, hoping that you achieve success.
And fight in Allah's cause against those who fight you and do not exceed the limits; and Allah does not like the transgressors.
And slay the disbelievers wherever you find them, and drive them out from where they drove you out, and the turmoil they cause is worse than slaying; and do not fight them near the Sacred Mosque until they fight you there; so if they fight you, slay them; this is the punishment of the disbelievers.
Then if they desist, then indeed Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
And fight them until no mischief remains, and only Allah is worshipped; then if they desist, do not harm them, except the unjust.
The sacred month for the sacred month, and respect in lieu of respect; harm the one who harms you, to the extent as he did – and keep fearing Allah, and know well that Allah is with the pious.
And spend your wealth in Allah's cause, and do not fall into ruin with your own hands; and be virtuous; undoubtedly the righteous are the beloved of Allah.
And perform Hajj (greater pilgrimage) and Umrah (lesser pilgrimage) for Allah; and if you are prevented, send sacrifice whatever is available; and do not shave your heads until the sacrifice reaches its destination; so whoever among you is sick or has an ailment in the head, must pay a compensation by fasting or charity or sacrifice; then when you are in peace – and whoever takes the advantage of combining the Hajj and Umrah, it is compulsory for him to sacrifice whatever is available; and whoever cannot afford it, must fast for three days while on the pilgrimage, and seven when you have returned to your homes; these are ten in all; this decree is for him who is not a resident of Mecca; and keep fearing Allah and know well that Allah’s punishment is severe.
The Hajj is during the well-known months; and for one who intends to perform the Hajj in it – neither is there to be mention of cohabitation in the presence of women, nor any sin, nor a fight with anyone till the completion of Hajj; and whatever good you do, Allah knows it; and take provision along with you for the best provision is piety; and keep fearing Me, O men of understanding!
It is no sin for you that you seek the bounty of your Lord; so when you return from Arafat, remember Allah near the Sacred Symbol (Mash’ar al Haram) – and remember Him in the manner He has guided you; and indeed, before this, you were of the astray.
Then, O people of Quraish, you too must return from the place where the people return from, and ask forgiveness from Allah; indeed Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
So when you have completed your Hajj rites, remember Allah as you used to remember your forefathers, in fact more than that; and among the people are some that say, “Our Lord!
Give us in this world” – and he does not have a portion in the Hereafter.
And among them are some that say, “Our Lord! Give us good in the world and good in the Hereafter, and save us from the punishment of fire!”
For such is a portion from what they have earned; and Allah is Swift At Taking Account.
And remember Allah in the counted days; so whoever hastens by departing in two days, there is no sin on him; and whoever stays on, there is no sin for him – for the pious; and keep fearing Allah, and know well that it is to Him you will be raised.
And among men is one whose conversation may please you in the life of this world, and he brings Allah as witness to what is in his heart, whereas he is the biggest quarreller!
And when he turns away, he creates turmoil in the earth and destroys crops and lives; and Allah is not pleased with turmoil.
And when it is said to him, “Fear Allah”, he becomes more resolute in committing sin – therefore hell is sufficient for such; and that is indeed, a very wretched resting place.
And among men is one who sells himself to seek the pleasure of Allah; and Allah is Most Compassionate towards the bondmen.
O People who Believe!
Enter Islam in full – and do not follow the footsteps of the devil; indeed he is your open enemy.
And if you renege, even after the clear commands have come to you, then know well that Allah is Almighty, Wise.
What are they waiting for, except that Allah’s punishment should come through stretched clouds and the angels descend and the matter be finished?
And all matters are directed only towards Allah.
Ask the Descendants of Israel how many clear signs We gave them; and whoever alters Allah’s favour which came to him, then indeed Allah’s punishment is severe.
The life of this world is made to appear beautiful in the sight of the disbelievers, and they make fun of the believers; and the pious will be above them on the Day of Resurrection; and Allah may give to whomever He wills, without account.
Mankind was on one religion; so Allah sent Prophets giving glad tidings and warnings – and with them sent down the true Book to judge between mankind on their differences; and only those to whom it was given created disputes regarding the Book, after clear commands had come to them, due to hostility of one another; so Allah, by His command, made the truth clear to the believers, concerning their disputes; and Allah may guide whomever He wills to the Straight Path.
Are you under the illusion that you will enter Paradise whereas the suffering, which came to those before you, has not yet come to you?
Hardship and adversity befell them and they were shaken, to the extent that the Noble Messenger and the believers along with him said, “When will the help of Allah come?”; pay heed!
Allah’s help is surely near.
They ask you what they should spend; say, “Whatever you spend for good, is for parents and near relatives and orphans and the needy and the traveller”; and whatever good you do, indeed Allah knows it.
Fighting in Allah's cause is ordained for you, whereas it is disliked by you; and it is possible that you hate a thing which is better for you; and it is possible that you like a thing which is bad for you; and Allah knows, and you do not know.
They ask you the decree regarding fighting in the sacred month; say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “Fighting in it is a great sin; and to prevent from the way of Allah, and not to believe in Him and to prevent (people) from the Sacred Mosque and to expel its residents – these are greater sins before Allah"; and the turmoil they cause is worse than killing; and they will keep fighting you till they turn you away from your religion, if they can; and whoever among you turns renegade and dies as a disbeliever, then their deeds are wasted in this world and in the Hereafter; and they are the people of hell; they will remain in it forever.
Those who believed, and those who migrated for the sake of Allah, and fought in Allah's cause – they are hopeful of gaining Allah’s mercy; and Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
They ask you the decree regarding wine (intoxicants) and gambling; say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “In both is great sin, and some worldly benefit for men – but their sin is greater than their benefit”; and they ask you what they should spend; say, “That which remains spare (surplus)”; this is how Allah explains His verses to you, so that you may think.
Before you execute your deeds of this world and of the Hereafter; and they ask you the decree regarding orphans; say, “To do good towards them is better; and if you combine your expenses with theirs, they are your brothers”; and Allah knows very well the one who spoils from him who improves; and if Allah willed, He could have put you in hardship; and Allah is Almighty, Wise.
And do not marry polytheist women until they become Muslims; for undoubtedly a Muslim bondwoman is better than a polytheist woman, although you may like her; and do not give your women in marriage to polytheist men until they accept faith; for undoubtedly a Muslim slave is better than a polytheist, although you may like him; they invite you towards the fire; and Allah invites towards Paradise and forgiveness by His command; and explains His verses to mankind so that they may accept guidance.
And they ask you the decree concerning menstruation; say, “It is an impurity, so stay away from women at such times, and do not cohabit with them until they have cleansed themselves; so when they have cleansed themselves, cohabit with them the way Allah has determined for you”; indeed Allah loves those who repent profusely, and loves those who keep clean.
Your women are a tillage for you; so come into your tillage as you will; and first perform the deeds that benefit you; and keep fearing Allah, and know well that you have to meet Him; and (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) give glad tidings to the Muslims.
And do not make Allah a target of your oaths, by pledging against being virtuous and pious, and against making peace among mankind; and Allah is All Hearing, All Knowing.
Allah does not take you to task for oaths which are made unintentionally but He does take you to task for deeds which your hearts have done; and Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Forbearing.
Those who swear not to touch their wives have four months’ time; so if they turn back during this period, indeed Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
And if they firmly decide to divorce them, Allah is All Hearing, All Knowing.
And divorced women shall restrain themselves for three menstrual periods; and it is not lawful for them to conceal what Allah has created in their wombs if they believe in Allah and the Last Day; and their husbands have the right to take them back, during this time, if they desire reconciliation; and the women also have rights similar to those of men over them, in accordance with Islamic law – and men have superiority over them; and Allah is Almighty, Wise.
This type of divorce is up to twice; the woman must then be retained on good terms or released with kindness; and it is not lawful for you to take back from women a part of what you have given them except when both fear that they may not be able to stay within the limits established by Allah; so if you fear that they may not be able to observe the limits of Allah, then it is no sin on them if the woman pays to get her release; these are the limits set by Allah, so do not exceed them; and those who transgress Allah’s limits are the unjust.
Then if he divorces her the third time, she will not be lawful to him until she has stayed with another husband; then if the other husband divorces her, it is no sin for these two to reunite if they consider that they can keep the limits of Allah established; these are the limits set by Allah which He explains for people of intellect.
And when you have divorced women, and their term reaches its end, either retain them on good terms within this period or release them with kindness; and do not retain them in order to hurt them, hence transgressing the limits; and he who does so harms only himself; and do not make the signs of Allah the objects of ridicule; and remember Allah’s favour that is bestowed upon you and that He has sent down to you the Book and wisdom, for your guidance; keep fearing Allah and know well that Allah knows everything. (The traditions of the Holy Prophet – sunnah and hadith – are called wisdom.)
And when you have divorced women and they complete their waiting period – then O guardians of such women, do not prevent them from marrying their husbands if they agree between themselves in accordance with Islamic law; this lesson is for those among People who Believe in Allah and the Last Day; this is purer for you, and cleaner; and Allah knows and you do not know.
And mothers shall breast-feed their children for two full years – for those who wish to complete the term of milk feeding; and the father of the child must provide for food and clothing of the mother in accordance with custom; no one will be burdened except with what he can bear; a mother should not be harmed because of her child, nor he to whom the child is born be harmed because of his child (or a mother should not harm the child nor he to whom the child is born should harm the child); and the same is incumbent on the guardian in place of the father; then if the parents desire to wean the child by mutual consent and consultation, it is no sin for them; and if you wish to give your children out to a (milk feeding) nurse, it is no sin for you, provided you pay to them what is agreed, with kindness; and keep fearing Allah, and know well that Allah is seeing what you do.
And those among you who die leaving wives behind them, then such widows shall restrain themselves for four months and ten days; so when their term is completed, O guardians of such women, there is no sin on you in what the women may decide for themselves in accordance with Islamic law; and Allah is Well Aware of what you do.
And there is no sin on you if you propose marriage to women while they are hidden from your view, or hide it in your hearts; Allah knows that you will now remember them, but do not make secret pacts with women except by decent words recognised by Islamic law; and do not consummate the marriage until the written command reaches its completion; know well that Allah knows what is in your hearts, therefore fear Him; and know well that Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Forbearing.
There is no sin upon you if you divorce women while you have not touched them or appointed their bridal money; and give them some provision; the rich according to their means, and the poor according to their means; a fair provision according to custom; this is a duty upon the virtuous.
If you divorce them before you have touched them and have appointed the bridal money, then payment of half of what is agreed is ordained unless the women forgo some of it, or he in whose hand is the marriage tie, pays more; and O men, your paying more is closer to piety; and do not forget the favours to each other; indeed Allah is seeing what you do.
Guard all your prayers, and the middle prayer; and stand with reverence before Allah.
And if you are in fear, pray while on foot or while riding, as you can; when you are in peace remember Allah the way He has taught you, which you did not know.
And those among you who die leaving wives behind them – they should bequeath for their wives a complete provision for one full year without turning them out; so if they go out themselves, there is no sin on you regarding what they do of themselves in a reasonable manner; and Allah is Almighty, Wise.
And for divorced women also, is a complete provision in reasonable manner; this is a duty upon the pious.
This is how Allah explains His verses to you so that you may understand.
Did you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) not see those who left their homes, whereas they numbered in thousands, fearing death?
So Allah said to them, “Die”; He then brought them back to life; indeed Allah is Most Munificent towards mankind, but most men are ungrateful.
And fight in Allah's cause and know well that Allah is All Hearing, All Knowing.
Is there someone who will lend an excellent loan to Allah, so that He may increase it for him several times over?
And Allah restricts and eases (the sustenance) – and it is to Him that you will return.
Did you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) not see a group of the Descendants of Israel, after Moosa? When they said to one of their Prophets (Shamueel – Samuel), “Appoint a king for us so that we may fight in Allah’s way”?
He said, “Do you think you would refrain from fighting if it is made obligatory for you?”
They said, “What is the matter with us that we should not fight in Allah’s cause, whereas we have been driven away from our homeland and our children?”
So when fighting was ordained for them, they all turned away, except a few; and Allah is Well Aware of the unjust.
And their Prophet said to them, “Indeed Allah has sent Talut (Saul) as your king”; they said, “Why should he have kingship over us whereas we deserve the kingship more than he, and nor has he been given enough wealth?” He said, “Indeed Allah has chosen him above you, and has bestowed him with vast knowledge and physique”; and Allah may bestow His kingdom on whomever He wills; and Allah is Most Capable, All Knowing.
And their Prophet said to them, “Indeed the sign of his kingdom will be the coming of a (wooden) box to you, in which from your Lord is the contentment of hearts and containing some souvenirs (remnants) left behind by the honourable Moosa and the honourable Haroon (Aaron), borne by the angels; indeed in it is a great sign* for you if you are believers.”
(The remnants of pious persons are blessed by Allah.)
So when Talut left the city along with the armies, he said, “Allah will surely test you with a river; so whoever drinks its water is not mine – and whoever does not drink is mine – except him who takes it in the hollow of his hand”; so they all drank it, except a few of them; thereafter when Talut and the believers with him had crossed the river, they said, “We do not have power this day to face Jalut (Goliath) and his armies”; those who were certain of meeting Allah said, “Many a times has a smaller group overcome a bigger group by Allah’s command; and Allah is with the steadfast.”
And when they confronted Jalut and his armies they invoked, “Our Lord! Pour (bestow abundantly) on us patience (fortitude), and keep our feet steady, and help us against the disbelieving people.”
So they routed them by the command of Allah; and Dawud (David) slew Jalut, and Allah gave him the kingdom and wisdom, and taught him all whatever He willed; and if Allah does not ward off some men by others, the earth will be destroyed, but Allah is Most Munificent towards the entire creation.
These are the verses of Allah, which We recite to you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) with truth; and undoubtedly you are one of the Noble Messengers.
These are the Noble Messengers, to whom We gave excellence over each other; of them are some with whom Allah spoke, and some whom He exalted high above all others; and We gave Eisa (Jesus), the son of Maryam, clear signs and We aided him with the Holy Spirit; and if Allah willed, those after them would not have fought each other after the clear evidences had come to them, but they differed – some remained on faith and some turned disbelievers; and had Allah willed, they would not have fought each other; but Allah may do as He wills.
O People who Believe!
Spend in Allah's cause, from what We have provided you, before the advent of a day in which there is no trade, and for the disbelievers neither any friendship nor intercession; and the disbelievers themselves are the unjust.
Allah – there is no God except Him; He is Alive (eternally, on His own) and the Upholder (keeps others established); He never feels drowsy nor does He sleep; to Him only belongs all whatever is in the heavens and all whatever is in the earth; who is he that can intercede* with Him except by His command?
He knows what is in front of them and what is behind them; and they do not achieve anything of His knowledge except what He wills; His Throne (of Sovereignty) encompasses the heavens and the earth; and it is not difficult for Him to guard them; and He is the Supreme, the Greatest.
(This Verse is popularly known as Ayat Al-Kursi.
It has a special status and reciting it carries great reward. *Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him – will be the first one to be granted the permission to intercede, others will follow.)
There is no compulsion at all in religion; undoubtedly the right path has become very distinct from error; and whoever rejects faith in the devil (false deities) and believes in Allah has grasped a very firm handhold; it will never loosen; and Allah is All Hearing, All Knowing.
Allah is the Guardian of the Muslims – He removes them from realms of darkness towards light; and the supporters of disbelievers are the devils – they remove them from light towards the realms of darkness; it is they who are the people of fire; they will remain in it forever.
Did you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) not see him who argued with Ibrahim (Abraham) concerning his Lord, as Allah had given him the kingdom? When Ibrahim said, “My Lord is He Who gives life and causes death”, he answered, “I give life and cause death”; Ibrahim said, “So indeed it is Allah Who brings the sun from the East – you bring it from the West!” – the disbeliever was therefore baffled; and Allah does not guide the unjust.
Or like him* who passed by a dwelling and it had fallen flat on its roofs; he said, “How will Allah bring it to life, after its death?”; so Allah kept him dead for a hundred years, then brought him back to life; He said, “How long have you stayed here?”; he replied, “I may have stayed for a day or little less”; He said, “In fact, you have spent a hundred years – so look at your food and drink which do not even smell stale; and look at your donkey whose bones even are not intact – in order that We may make you a sign for mankind – and look at the bones how We assemble them and then cover them with flesh”; so when the matter became clear to him, he said, “I know well that Allah is Able to do all things.” (Prophet Uzair – peace be upon him.)
And when Ibrahim said, “My Lord! Show me how You will give life to the dead”; He said, “Are you not certain (of it)?”
Ibrahim said, “Surely yes, why not?
But because I wish to put my heart at ease”; He said, “Therefore take four birds (as pets) and cause them to become familiar to you, then place a part of each of them on separate hills, then call them – they will come running towards you; and know well that Allah is Almighty, Wise.”
(Prophet Ibrahim called the dead birds and they did come running towards him.)
The example of those who spend their wealth in Allah’s way is similar to that of a grain which has sprouted seven stalks and in each stalk are a hundred grains; and Allah may increase it still more than this, for whomever He wills; and Allah is Most Capable, All Knowing.
Those who spend their wealth in Allah’s way and thereafter do not express favour nor cause injury (hurt the recipient’s feelings), their reward is with their Lord; there shall be no fear upon them nor shall they grieve.
Speaking kind words and pardoning are better than charity followed by injury; and Allah is the Independent, Most Forbearing.
O People who Believe! Do not invalidate your charity by expressing favour and causing injury – like one who spends his wealth for people to see, and does not believe in Allah and the Last Day; his example is similar to that of a rock covered with dust and hard rain fell on it, leaving it as a bare rock; they shall get no control over (or benefit from) anything they have earned; and Allah does not guide the disbelievers.
And the example of those who spend their wealth in order to seek Allah’s pleasure and to make their hearts steadfast, is similar to that of a garden on a height – hard rain fell on it, so bringing forth its fruit twofold; so if hard rain does not reach it, the dew is enough; and Allah is seeing your deeds.
Would any of you like that he may own a garden of dates and grapes, with rivers flowing beneath it – in it are all kinds of fruits for him – and he reaches old age and has young children; therefore a windstorm containing fire came to the garden, burning it?
This is how Allah explains His verses to you, so that you may give thought.
O People who Believe! Spend a part of your lawful earnings, and part of what We have produced from the earth for you – and do not (purposely) choose upon the flawed to give from it (in charity) whereas you would not accept it yourselves except with your eyes closed towards it; and know well that Allah is Independent, Most Praised.
The devil scares you of poverty and bids you to the shameful; and Allah promises you forgiveness from Him, and munificence; and Allah is Most Capable, All Knowing.
Allah bestows wisdom on whomever He wills; and whoever receives wisdom has received abundant goodness; but none heed advice except men of understanding.
And whatever you spend or pledge to do, Allah is aware of it; and the unjust do not have supporters.
If you give charity openly, what an excellent deed it is! And if you secretly give it to the poor, it is the best for you; and it will redeem some of your sins; and Allah is Aware of your deeds.
It is not your duty (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) to make them accept guidance – but Allah guides whomever He wills; and whatever good thing you spend is beneficial for yourselves; and it is not right for you to spend except to seek Allah’s pleasure; and whatever you spend will be repaid to you in full, and you will not be wronged. –
(Spend) For the poor who are restricted while in Allah's cause, who cannot travel in the land (for earning) – the unwise think they are wealthy because of their restraint; you will recognise them by their faces; they do not seek from people in order to avoid grovelling; and Allah knows whatever you spend in charity.
Those who spend their wealth by night and day, secretly and openly – their reward is with their Lord; and there shall be no fear upon them nor shall they grieve.
Those who devour usury will not stand up on the Day of Judgement, except like the one whom an evil jinn has deranged by his touch; that is because they said, “Trade is also like usury!”; whereas Allah has made trading lawful and forbidden usury; for one to whom the guidance has come from his Lord, and he refrained therefrom, is lawful what he has taken in the past; and his affair is with Allah; and whoever continues earning it henceforth, is of the people of fire; they will remain in it for ages.
Allah destroys usury and increases charity; and Allah does not like any ungrateful, excessive sinner.
Indeed those who believed and did good deeds and kept the prayer established and paid the charity – their reward is with their Lord; and there shall be no fear upon them nor shall they grieve.
O People who Believe! Fear Allah and forego the remaining usury, if you are Muslims.
And if you do not, then be certain of a war with Allah and His Noble Messenger; and if you repent, take back your principal amount; neither you cause harm to someone, nor you be harmed.
And if the debtor is in difficulty, give him respite till the time of ease; and your foregoing the entire debt from him is still better for you, if only you realise.
And fear the day in which you will be returned to Allah; and every soul will be paid back in full what it had earned, and they will not be wronged.
O People who Believe! If you make an agreement for debt for a specified time, write it down; and appoint a scribe to write it for you with accuracy; and the scribe must not refuse to write in the manner Allah has taught him, so he must write; and the liable person (debtor) should dictate it to him and fear Allah, Who is his Lord, and not hide anything of the truth; but if the debtor is of poor reasoning, or weak, or unable to dictate, then his guardian must dictate with justice; and appoint two witnesses from your men; then if two men are not available, one man and two women from those you would prefer to be witnesses, so that if one of them forgets, the other can remind her; and the witnesses must not refuse when called upon to testify; do not feel burdened to write it, whether the transaction is small or big – write it for up to its term’s end; this is closer to justice before Allah and will be a strong evidence and more convenient to dispel doubts amongst yourselves – except when it is an instant trade in which exchange is carried out immediately, there is no sin on you if it is not written down; and take witnesses whenever you perform trade; and neither the scribe nor the witnesses be caused any harm (or they cause any harm); and if you do, it would be an offence on your part; and fear Allah; and Allah teaches you; and Allah knows everything.
And if you are on a journey and cannot find a scribe, then a mortgage (deposit) must be handed over; and if one of you trusts the other, the one who is trusted may return the mortgage entrusted to him and fear Allah, his Lord; and do not hide testimony; and if one hides it, his heart is sinful from within; and Allah knows what you do.
To Allah only belongs all whatever is in the heavens and all whatever is in the earth; and whether you disclose what is in your hearts or hide it, Allah will take account of it from you; so He will forgive whomever He wills and punish whomever He wills; and Allah is Able to do all things.
The Noble Messenger believes in what has been sent down to him by his Lord, and so do the believers; all have accepted faith in Allah and His angels and His Books and His Noble Messengers; saying, “We do not make any distinction, in believing, between any of His Noble Messengers”; and they said, “We hear, and we obey; Your forgiveness be granted, O our Lord, and towards You is our return.”
Allah does not burden anyone, except with something within its capacity; beneficial for it is the virtue it earned, and harmful for it is the evil it earned; “Our Lord!
Do not seize us if we forget or are mistaken; our Lord!
And do not place on us a heavy burden (responsibility) as You did on those before us; our Lord!
And do not impose on us a burden, for which we do not have the strength; and pardon us – and forgive us – and have mercy on us – You are our Master, therefore help us against the disbelievers.”
Alif-Laam-Meem. (Alphabets of the Arabic language; Allah and to whomever He reveals, know their precise meanings.)
Allah – none is worthy of worship, except Him, He is Alive (eternally, on His own) and the Upholder (keeps others established).
He has sent down to you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) this true Book (the Holy Qur’an), confirming the Books before it, and He sent down the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Bible). –
Before this, a guidance to mankind; and sent down the Judgement (Criterion to judge between right and wrong); indeed for those who disbelieved in the verses of Allah, is a severe punishment; and Allah is the Almighty, the Avenger (of the wrong).
Indeed nothing is hidden from Allah, neither in the earth nor in the heavens.
It is He Who fashions (moulds) you in your mothers’ wombs as He wills; none is worthy of worship except Him, the Almighty (the Most Honourable), the Wise.
It is He Who has sent down to you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) this Book (the Qur’an) containing the verses that have a clear meaning – they are the core of the Book – and other verses the meanings of which are indistinct; those in whose hearts is deviation pursue the verses having indistinct meanings, in order to cause turmoil and seeking its (wrongful) interpretation; and only Allah knows its proper interpretation; and those having sound knowledge say, “We believe in it, all of it is from our Lord”; and none accept guidance except the men of understanding.
“Our Lord! Do not deviate our hearts after You have guided us, and bestow mercy on us from Yourself; indeed You only are the Great Bestower.”
“Our Lord! Indeed You will gather all mankind for a Day about which there is no doubt"; indeed Allah’s promise does not change.
Indeed for those who disbelieve, neither their wealth nor their offspring will help to save them in the least from Allah; and it is they who are fuel for the fire.
Like the way of Firaun’s people, and those before them; they denied Our signs; so Allah seized them because of their sins; and Allah’s punishment is severe.
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) to the disbelievers, “Very soon you shall be overcome and driven towards hell; and that is a wretched resting-place.”
Indeed there was a sign for you in the two groups that clashed; one army fighting in Allah's cause, against the other of disbelievers, whom they (the Muslims) saw with their eyes, as twice their own number; and Allah strengthens with His help whomever He wills; indeed in this is a lesson for the intelligent, to be learnt by observing.
Beautified is for mankind the love of these desires – women, and sons, and heaps of gold and piled up silver, and branded horses, and cattle and fields; this is the wealth of the life of this world; and it is Allah, with Whom is the excellent abode.
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “Shall I inform you of something better than that?
For the pious, with their Lord, are Gardens beneath which rivers flow – they will abide in it forever – and pure wives, and Allah’s pleasure”; and Allah sees the bondmen.
Those who say, “Our Lord! we have accepted faith, so forgive us our sins and save us from the punishment of fire.”
The steadfast, and the truthful, and the reverent, and who spend in Allah's cause, and who seek forgiveness in the last hours of the night (before dawn).
Allah has given witness that there is none worthy of worship (God) except Him – and the angels and the scholars also give witness, established with justice (with truth) – there is no God except Him, the Almighty, the Wise.
Indeed the only true religion in the sight of Allah is Islam; those who had received the Books differed only after the knowledge came to them, due to their hearts’ envy; and whoever disbelieves in the signs of Allah, then Allah is Swift At Taking Account.
Then if they argue with you, (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) say, “I have submitted my face (self) to Allah and likewise have my followers”; and say to the People given the Book(s) and the illiterate, “Have you submitted (accepted Islam)?”
If they submit, they have attained the right path – and if they turn away (reject), then your duty is only to convey this command; and Allah is seeing the bondmen.
Those who disbelieve in the signs of Allah, and wrongfully martyr the Prophets, and slay people who enjoin justice – so give them the glad tidings of a painful punishment.
They are those whose deeds are wasted in this world and in the Hereafter; and they do not have any aides.
Did you not see them who have received a part of the Book – when called towards the Book of Allah for judging between them, a group of them opposes it and turns away?
They dared to do this because they say, “The fire will definitely not touch us except for a certain number of days”; and they are deceived in their religion by the lies they fabricated.
So what will be (their state) when We bring all of them together for the Day (of Resurrection) about which there is no doubt; and every soul will be paid back in full for what it has earned, and they will not be wronged.
Invoke (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “O Allah! Owner Of The Kingdom – You bestow the kingdom on whomever You will, and You take back the kingdom from whomever You will; and You give honour to whomever You will, and You humiliate whomever You will; only in Your Hand (control) lies all goodness; indeed, You are Able to do all things.”
“You cause part of the night to pass into the day, and You cause part of the day to pass into the night; and You bring forth the living from the dead, and You bring forth the dead from the living; and You give to whomever You will, without account.”
The Muslims must not befriend the disbelievers, in preference over the Muslims; whoever does that has no connection whatsoever with Allah, except if you fear them; Allah warns you of His wrath; and towards Allah only is the return.
Say, (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “Whether you hide or reveal whatever is in your hearts, Allah knows it all; and He knows all whatever is in the heavens and all whatever is in the earth; and Allah has control over all things.”
On the Day when every soul will be confronted with all the good that it has done; and all the evil that it has done – it will wish that perhaps there would have been a great distance between itself and the punishment; and Allah warns you of His punishment; and Allah is Most Compassionate towards His bondmen.
Proclaim, (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “O mankind!
If you love Allah, follow me – Allah will love you and forgive you your sins”; and Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
Proclaim, “Obey Allah and the Noble Messenger”; so if they turn away – then Allah is not pleased with the disbelievers.
Indeed Allah chose Adam, and Nooh, and the Family of Ibrahim, and the Family of Imran over the creation.
They are the descendants one of another; and Allah is the All Hearing, the All Knowing.
(Remember) When the wife of Imran said, “My Lord! I pledge to you what is in my womb – that it shall be dedicated purely in Your service, so accept it from me; indeed You only are the All Hearing, the All Knowing.”
So when she gave birth to it, she said, “My Lord! I have indeed given birth to a girl!”
And Allah well knows what she gave birth to; and the boy she had prayed for is not like this girl; “And I have named her Maryam and I give her and her offspring in Your protection, against Satan the outcast.”
So her Lord fully accepted her (Maryam), and gave her an excellent development; and gave her in Zakaria’s guardianship; whenever Zakaria visited her at her place of prayer, he found new food with her; he said, “O Maryam! From where did this come to you?”
She answered, “It is from Allah; indeed Allah gives to whomever He wills, without limit account.” (Miracles occur through the friends of Allah.)
It is here that Zakaria prayed to his Lord; he said, “My Lord! Give me from Yourself a righteous child; indeed You only are the Listener Of Prayer.”
And the angels called out to him while he was standing, offering prayer at his place of worship, “Indeed Allah gives you glad tidings of Yahya (John), who will confirm a Word (or sign) from Allah, – a leader, always refraining from women, a Prophet from one of Our devoted ones.”
He said, “My Lord! How can I have a son when old age has reached me and my wife is barren?”
He said, “This is how Allah brings about, whatever He wills.”
He said, “My Lord!
Determine a sign for me”; He said, “The sign is that you shall not be able to speak to mankind for three days except by signs; and remember your Lord profusely, and proclaim His Purity before sunset and at dawn.”
And when the angels said, “O Maryam! Indeed Allah has chosen you and purified you, and has this day, chosen you among all the women of the world.”
“O Maryam! Stand in reverence before your Lord, prostrate yourself and bow along with those who bow.”
These are tidings of the hidden, which We secretly reveal to you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him); and you were not present with them when they threw their pens to draw lots, to know who should be the guardian of Maryam; nor were you present with them when they were quarrelling.
(Yet you know of these things – this is a proof of your being a Prophet.)
And remember when the angels said, “O Maryam! Allah gives you glad tidings of a Word from Him, whose name is the Messiah, Eisa the son of Maryam – he will be honourable in this world and in the Hereafter, and among the close ones (to Allah).”
“He will speak to people while he is in the cradle and in his adulthood, and will be of the devoted ones.”
She said, “My Lord! How can I bear a child when no man has ever touched me?”
He said, “This is how Allah creates whatever He wills; when He wills a thing, He only says to it, ‘Be’ – and it happens immediately.”
“And Allah will teach him the Book and wisdom, and the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Bible).”
“And he will be a Noble Messenger towards the Descendants of Israel saying, ‘I have come to you with a sign from your Lord, for I mould a birdlike sculpture from clay for you, and I blow into it and it instantly becomes a (living) bird, by Allah’s command; and I heal him who was born blind, and the leper, and I revive the dead, by Allah’s command; and I tell you what you eat and what you store in your houses; undoubtedly in these (miracles) is a great sign for you, if you are believers.’
(Several miracles bestowed to Prophet Eisa are mentioned here.)
‘And I come confirming the Taurat (Torah) – the Book before me – and to make lawful for you some of the things which were forbidden to you, and I have come to you with a sign from your Lord – therefore fear Allah and obey me.’
‘Undoubtedly Allah is the Lord of all – mine and yours – so worship Him only; this is the Straight Path.’”
So when Eisa sensed their disbelief he said, “Who will be my aides towards (in the cause of) Allah?”
The disciples said, “We are the aides of Allah’s religion; we believe in Allah, and you bear witness that we are Muslims.”
“Our Lord! We have believed in what You have sent down and we follow the Noble Messenger, therefore record us among the witnesses of the truth.”
And the disbelievers conspired (to kill Eisa), and Allah covertly planned to destroy them; and Allah is the best of secret planners.
Remember when Allah said, “O Eisa! I will keep you alive till your full age, and raise you towards Me, and cleanse you of the disbelievers and give your followers dominance over the disbelievers until the Day of Resurrection; then you will all return to Me, so I shall judge between you concerning the matter in which you dispute.”
“So I shall mete a severe punishment to those who disbelieve, in this world and in the Hereafter; and they will not have any supporters.”
“And for those who believed and did good deeds, Allah will give them their full reward; and Allah does not like the unjust.”
These are some verses that We recite to you, and advice full of wisdom.
The example of Eisa with Allah is like that of Adam; He created him (Adam) from clay and then said to him, “Be” – and it thereupon happens!
O listener! (followers of this Prophet) This is the Truth from your Lord, so never be of those who doubt.
Therefore say to those who dispute with you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) concerning Eisa after the knowledge has come to you, “Come! Let us summon our sons and your sons, and our women and your women, and ourselves and yourselves – then pray humbly, thereby casting the curse of Allah upon the liars!”
(The Christians did not accept this challenge.)
This undoubtedly is the true narrative; there is none worthy of worship except Allah; and Allah is the Almighty, the Wise.
So if they turn away, then indeed Allah knows those who cause turmoil.
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “O People given the Book(s)! Come towards a word which is common between us and you, that we shall worship no one except Allah, and that we shall not ascribe any partner to Him, and that none of us shall take one another as lords besides Allah”; then if they do not accept say, “Be witness that (only) we are Muslims.”
O People given the Book(s)! Why do you argue about Ibrahim, whereas the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Bible) were not sent down until after him?
So do you not have sense?
Listen! This was what you argued about – of which you have some knowledge – why do you then argue about the matter you do not have any knowledge of?
And Allah knows whereas you do not know.
Ibrahim was neither a Jew nor a Christian; but he was a Muslim, free from all falsehood; and was not of the polytheists.
Undoubtedly among all mankind who have the best claim to Ibrahim are those who followed him, and this Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) and the believers; and Allah is the Guardian of the believers.
A group among the People given the Book(s) desire that if only they could lead you astray; and they only make themselves astray, and they do not have sense.
O People given the Book(s)! Why do you disbelieve in the signs of Allah, whereas you yourselves are witnesses?
O People given the Book(s)! Why do you mix the truth with falsehood and conceal the truth, whereas you know?
And a group among the People given the Book(s) said, “Believe in what has been sent down to the believers in the morning and deny it by evening – perhaps they (the Muslims) may turn back (disbelieve).”
“And do not believe in anyone except him who follows your religion”; say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “Only Allah’s guidance is the true guidance” – (so why not believe in it) if someone has been given similar to what was given to you, or if someone may be able to evidence it against you before your Lord; say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “Undoubtedly the munificence lies only in Allah’s Hand (control); He may bestow upon whomever He wills; and Allah is Most Capable, All Knowing.”
“He chooses by His mercy, whomever He wills; and Allah is the Owner of Great Munificence.”
Among the People given the Book(s) is one who, if you trust him with a heap of treasure, will return it to you; and among them is one who, if you trust him with (just) one coin, will not return it to you unless you constantly stand over him (keep demanding); that is because they say, “We are not obliged in any way, in the case of illiterates”; and they purposely fabricate lies against Allah.
Yes, why not? Whoever fulfilled his pledge and practised piety – and indeed Allah loves the pious.
Those who accept abject prices in exchange of Allah’s covenant and their oaths, do not have a portion in the Hereafter – Allah will neither speak to them nor look towards them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them; and for them is a painful punishment.
And amongst them are some who distort (change words of) the Book with their tongues, so that you may think that this also is in the Book whereas it is not in the Book; and they say, “This is from Allah” whereas it is not from Allah; and they fabricate lies against Allah, whereas they know.
It is not for any human to whom Allah has given the Book and wisdom and Prophethood, that he should afterwards say to the people, “Leave (the worship of) Allah and be my worshippers” – but he will surely say, “Be sincere worshippers of Allah, because you teach the Book and you preach from it.”
And nor will he command you to appoint the angels and the Prophets as Gods; would he (a Prophet) command you to disbelieve after you have become Muslims?
And remember when Allah took a covenant from the Prophets; “If I give you the Book and knowledge and the (promised) Noble Messenger (Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) comes to you, confirming the Books you possess, you shall positively, definitely believe in him and you shall positively, definitely help him”; He said, “Do you agree, and accept My binding responsibility in this matter?” They all answered, “We agree”; He said, “Then bear witness amongst yourselves, and I Myself am a witness with you.”
So those who turn away after this – it is they who are the sinners.
So do they desire a religion other than the religion of Allah, whereas to Him has submitted whoever is in the heavens and the earth, willingly or grudgingly, and it is to Him they will return?
Say, “We believe in Allah and what is sent down to us and what was sent down to Ibrahim, and Ismael, and Ishaq, and Yaqub (Jacob) and their sons, and that which came to Moosa and Eisa and the Prophets, from their Lord; we do not make any distinction, in belief, between any of them, and to Him we have submitted ourselves.”
And if one seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted from him; and he is among the losers in the Hereafter.
Why should Allah will guidance for the people who disbelieved, after their having accepted faith and bearing witness that the Noble Messenger is a true one, and after clear signs had come to them?
And Allah does not guide the unjust.
The recompense of such is that on them is the curse of Allah and of the angels and of men combined.
Remaining in it forever; their punishment will not be lightened, nor will they get any respite.
Except those who repented thereafter and reformed themselves; then indeed Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
Indeed those who disbelieve after having accepted faith, and advance further in their disbelief – their repentance will never be accepted; and it is they who are the astray.
Those who disbelieved and died as disbelievers – an earth full of gold will never be accepted from any one of them, even if he offers it, for his freedom; for them is a painful punishment and they do not have any aides.
You can never attain virtue until you spend in Allah's cause the things you love; and Allah is Aware of whatever you spend.
All food was lawful for the Descendants of Israel (Jacob), except what Israel forbade for himself, before the Taurat (Torah) was sent down; say, “Bring the Taurat and read it, if you are truthful.”
So henceforth whoever fabricates lies against Allah – it is they who are the unjust.
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “Allah is truthful; so follow the religion of Ibrahim, who was free from all falsehood; and he was not of the polytheists.”
Indeed the first house that was appointed as a place of worship for mankind, is the one at Mecca (the Holy Ka’aba), blessed and a guidance to the whole world;
In it are clear signs – the place where Ibrahim stood (is one of them); and whoever enters it shall be safe; and performing the Hajj (pilgrimage) of this house, for the sake of Allah, is a duty upon mankind, for those who can reach it; and whoever disbelieves – then Allah is Independent (Unwanting) of the entire creation!
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “O People given the Book(s)! Why do you not believe in the verses (or signs) of Allah, whereas your deeds are being witnessed by Allah?”
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “O People given the Book(s)!
Why do you prevent those who have accepted faith from the way of Allah, seeking to cause deviation in it, whereas you yourselves are witnesses to it?
And Allah is not unaware of your deeds!”
O People who Believe! If you obey some of People given the Book(s), they will definitely turn you into disbelievers after your having accepted faith.
And how can you disbelieve, whereas Allah’s verses are recited to you and His Noble Messenger is present amongst you?!
And whoever takes the support of Allah is indeed guided to the right path.
O People who Believe! Fear Allah in the manner He should rightfully be feared, and do not die except as Muslims.
And hold fast to the rope of Allah, all of you together, and do not be divided; and remember Allah’s favour on you, that when there was enmity between you, He created affection between your hearts, so due to His grace you became like brothers to each other; and you were on the edge of a pit of fire (hell), so He saved you from it; this is how Allah explains His verses to you, so that you may be guided.
And there should be a group among you that invites to goodness, and enjoins good deeds and forbids immorality; it is they who are the successful.
And do not be like those who became divided and disputed after the clear signs had come to them; and for them is a terrible punishment.
On the Day (of Resurrection) when some faces will be shining and some faces black; so, (to) those whose faces are blackened, “What! You disbelieved after you had accepted faith!
Therefore now taste the punishment, the result of your disbelief.”
And those whose faces will be shining, are in the mercy of Allah; they will abide in it forever.
These are the verses of Allah, which We recite to you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), with truth; and Allah does not wish any injustice to the creation.
And to Allah only belongs all whatever is in the heavens and all whatever is in the earth; and towards Allah only is the return of all matters.
You are the best among all the nations that were raised among mankind – you enjoin good deeds and forbid immorality and you believe in Allah; and if the People given the Book(s) believed it would be better for them; some of them are believers (Muslims) and most of them are disbelievers.
(The best Ummah is that of Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him.)
They cannot harm you except cause some trouble; and if they fight against you, they will turn their backs on you; then they will not be helped.
Disgrace has been destined for them – wherever they are they shall not find peace, except by a rope from Allah and a rope from men – and they have deserved the wrath of Allah, and misery is destined for them; that is because they used to disbelieve in the signs of Allah, and unjustly martyr the Prophets; that was for their disobedience and transgression.
All of them are not alike; among the People given the Book(s) are some who are firm on the truth – they recite the verses of Allah in the night hours and prostrate (before Him).
They accept faith in Allah and the Last Day, and enjoin good deeds and forbid immorality, and hasten to perform good deeds; and they are the righteous.
And they will not be denied the reward of whatever good they do; and Allah knows the pious.
Indeed those who disbelieve – neither their wealth nor their offspring will help save them in the least, from Allah; and they are the people of fire; remaining in it forever.
The example of what they spend in this worldly life is similar to the freezing cold wind which struck the fields of a nation who wronged themselves, and destroyed it completely; and Allah did not oppress them, but it is they who wronged themselves.
O People who Believe!
Do not share your secrets with others – they do all they can to ruin you; they desire the maximum harm for you; enmity has been revealed from their speech, and what they hide in their breasts is greater; we have explained the signs clearly to you, if you have intelligence.
Listen!
It is you who love them and they do not love you, whereas the fact is that you believe in all the Books; when they meet you they say, “We believe”; and when they are alone they chew their fingers at you with rage; say, “Die in your frenzy!”
Allah knows well what lies within the hearts.
If some good reaches you, they feel unhappy; and if misfortune befalls you, they will rejoice; and if you remain steadfast and pious, their evil scheme will not harm you in the least; undoubtedly all what they do is encompassed by Allah.
And remember O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) when you came forth from your house in the morning, appointing the believers on positions of battle; and Allah is All Hearing, All Knowing.
When two groups among you almost decided to show cowardice – and Allah is their Protector; and in Allah only should the believers trust.
Allah indeed aided you at Badr when you had no means; so fear Allah – so that you may be thankful.
When you O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) said to the believers, “Is it not sufficient for you that your Lord may support you by sending down three thousand angels?”
Yes, why not? If you patiently endure and remain pious, and the disbelievers attack you suddenly, your Lord will send down five thousand marked angels to help you.
And Allah did not bestow this victory except for your happiness, and only that your hearts may attain peace with it; and there is no help except from Allah, the Almighty, the Wise.
So He may cut off a part of the disbelievers, or disgrace them so that they return unsuccessful.
This matter is not for you to decide – whether He guides them to repent or punishes them, for they are the unjust.
And to Allah only belongs all whatever is in the heavens and all whatever is in the earth; He may forgive whomever He wills, and punish whomever He wills; and Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
O People who Believe! Do not devour usury doubling and quadrupling it; and fear Allah, hoping that you achieve success.
And save yourselves from the fire which is prepared for disbelievers.
And obey Allah and the Noble Messenger, hoping that you gain mercy. (Obeying the Prophet is in fact obeying Allah.)
And rush towards forgiveness from your Lord, and towards a Paradise that can hold all the heavens and the earth in its width – prepared for the pious.
Those who spend in Allah’s cause, in happiness and in grief, and who control their anger and are forgiving towards mankind; and the righteous are the beloved of Allah.
And those who, when they commit an immoral act or wrong themselves, remember Allah and seek forgiveness of their sins – and who forgives sins except Allah? And those who do not purposely become stubborn regarding what they did.
For such the reward is forgiveness from their Lord, and Gardens beneath which rivers flow – abiding in it forever; what an excellent reward for the performers (of good deeds)!
Some traditions have been tried before you – therefore travel in the land and see what sort of fate befell those who denied.
This is an explanation for mankind, a guidance and an advice to the pious.
And do not be negligent nor grieve – it is you who will be victorious if you are believers.
If you have been struck by some misfortune, so they (the disbelievers) too have been struck earlier with the same misfortune; these are the days in which We have allotted turns to people; and so that Allah may make known the believers and may bestow martyrdom to some of you; and Allah does not befriend the unjust.
And so that Allah may purify* the believers, and destroy the disbelievers. (* Forgive them their sins, if any.)
What! You assume that you will enter Paradise while Allah has not yet tested your warriors, nor yet tested the steadfast?
And you used to wish for death before you met it; so now you see it before your eyes.
And Mohammed (peace and blessings be upon him) is purely* a Noble Messenger; there have been Noble Messengers before him; so if he departs or is martyred, will you turn back on your heels?
So whoever turns back on his heels does not cause any harm to Allah; and Allah will soon reward the thankful. (* Neither God nor an angel, but a human being with the highest spiritual status.)
And no soul can die except by Allah’s command – a time has been appointed for each; whoever desires the rewards of this world, We bestow upon him from it; and whoever desires the reward of the Hereafter, We bestow upon him from it; and We shall soon reward the thankful.
And many Prophets have fought in Allah’s cause – and many devoted men were with them; so neither did they lose heart due to the calamities that befell them in Allah's cause, nor did they weaken and nor were they subdued; and the steadfast are the beloved of Allah.
And they never said anything except that they invoked, “Our Lord! Forgive us our sins and the excesses committed during our efforts, and keep our feet steady, and bestow us help over the disbelievers.”
So Allah gave them the reward of this world and the best of rewards in the Hereafter; and Allah loves the righteous.
O People who Believe! If you obey the disbelievers, they will make you turn back on your heels, so you will then turn back as losers.
In fact, Allah is your Master; and He is the Best Supporter.
Soon We shall cast awe in the hearts of disbelievers because they have appointed partners to Allah, for which He has not sent any proof; their destination is hell; and what a wretched abode for the unjust!
And indeed Allah has proved true His promise to you, when you used to slay the disbelievers by His command; until the time you people lost courage and disputed about the order and disobeyed after Allah had shown you what pleases you; some of you desired the world, and some of you desired the Hereafter; thereafter He turned you away from them in order to test you; and undoubtedly He has forgiven you; and Allah is Most Munificent towards the Muslims.
When you were leaving, unconcerned without turning to look back at anyone, and from another group Our Noble Messenger was calling you (to fight); so He gave you sorrow in lieu of sorrow, and then forgave you so that you do not grieve over what has been lost or over the calamity that befell you; and Allah is Well Aware of what you do.
Then after grief, He sent down a peaceful slumber (calm), which engulfed a group among you – and another party kept fearing for their own lives, thinking wrongfully of Allah – like the thoughts of ignorance; they say, “Do we have any authority in this matter?” Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “All authority lies only with Allah”; they hide in their hearts what they do not reveal to you; they say, “Had we any control, we would not have been slain here”; say, “Even if you had been in your houses, those destined to be slain would have come forth to their places of slaying; and in order that Allah may test what is in your breasts and reveal whatever is in your hearts”; and Allah knows well what lies within the hearts.
Indeed those of you who turned back on the day when the two armies met – for it was the devil who caused them to waver, because of some of their deeds; and undoubtedly Allah has forgiven them; indeed Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Forbearing.
O People who Believe! Do not be like the disbelievers who said regarding their brothers who went on a journey or on holy war, “If they had been here with us they would not have died or been killed” – so that Allah may make it as despair in their hearts; and Allah gives life and causes death; and Allah is seeing your deeds.
And if you are killed in Allah’s way or die, then the pardon from Allah and mercy are better than all what they hoard.
And whether you are killed or you die, towards Allah you will be gathered.
So what a great mercy it is from Allah that you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), are lenient towards them; and if you had been stern and hardhearted (unsympathetic) they would have certainly been uneasy in your company; so forgive them and intercede for them and consult with them in the conduct of affairs; and when you decide upon something, rely upon Allah; indeed Allah loves those who trust (Him).
If Allah supports you, no one can overcome you; and if He forsakes you, who is there who can then help you?
And in Allah only should the Muslims trust.
And it is unimaginable that any Prophet would hide something; and whoever hides it, will bring what he hid with him on the Day of Resurrection; then every soul will be paid in full for whatever they earned; and they will not be wronged.
So is one who follows the will of Allah equal to one who has incurred the wrath from Allah and whose home is the fire?
And what a wretched place to return!
They are in different ranks before Allah; and Allah sees their deeds.
Allah has indeed bestowed a great favour upon the Muslims, in that He sent to them a Noble Messenger (Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) from among them, who recites to them His verses, and purifies them, and teaches them the Book and wisdom; and before it, they were definitely in open error. (The Holy Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him – is one of Allah’s greatest favours to mankind.)
So will you say when disaster strikes you, though you had struck them with twice as much, “Where has this come from?”
Say (to them, O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “It has come from yourselves”; indeed Allah is Able to do all things.
And the calamity that struck you on the day the two armies met, was by Allah’s command – and in order that He may make known the believers.
And in order to expose them who turned hypocrites; and it was said to them, “Come, fight in Allah's cause, or repel the enemy”; they answered, “If we knew how to fight, we would certainly have been with you”; and on that day they were nearer to open disbelief than to professed faith; they utter with their mouths what is not in their hearts; and Allah knows well what they hide. –
Those who spoke regarding their brothers while they themselves stayed back at home, “Had they listened to us, they would not have been slain”; say (to them, O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “Then avert your own death, if you are truthful!”
And do not ever assume that those who are slain in Allah's cause, are dead; in fact they are alive with their Lord, receiving sustenance. (Death does not mean extinction, it is the passing of the soul from this world to another.
Happy over what Allah has bestowed upon them from His grace, and rejoicing for those who will succeed them, and have not yet joined them; for on them is no fear nor any grief.
They rejoice because of the favours from Allah and (His) munificence, and because Allah does not waste the reward of the believers.
Those who responded to the call of Allah and His Noble Messenger after they had been grieved; for the virtuous and the pious among them is a great reward.
Those to whom the people said, “The people have gathered against you, therefore fear them”, so their faith was further increased; and they said, “Allah is Sufficient for us – and what an excellent (reliable) Trustee (of affairs) is He!”
So they returned with the favour and munificence from Allah, in that no harm reached them; they followed what pleased Allah; and Allah is Extremely Munificent.
It is the devil who threatens with his friends; so do not fear them and fear Me, if you have faith.
And O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) do not grieve for those who rush towards disbelief; they cannot cause any harm to Allah; and Allah does not will to assign them any portion in the Hereafter; and for them is a terrible punishment.
Those who have purchased disbelief in exchange of faith cannot cause any harm to Allah; and for them is a painful punishment.
And never must the disbelievers be under the illusion that the respite We give them is any good for them; We give them respite only for them to further advance in their sins; and for them is a disgraceful punishment.
Allah will not leave you, O People who Believe (the Muslims) in your present state, till He separates the evil from the good; and it does not befit Allah’s Majesty to give you, the common men, knowledge of the hidden, but Allah does chose from His Noble Messengers whomever He wills; so believe in Allah and His Noble Messengers; and if you believe and practice piety, for you is a great reward. (Allah gave the knowledge of the hidden to the Holy Prophet – peace and blessings be upon him.)
And never must those who act miserly upon what Allah has bestowed upon them of His grace, think that it is good for them; in fact it is harmful for them; soon what they had withheld will be collars round their necks on the Day of Resurrection; and Allah only is the Inheritor (Owner) of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is Well Aware of what you do.
Undoubtedly Allah heard them who said, “Allah is needy, and we are the wealthy”; We shall keep recorded their saying and their wrongfully martyring of the Prophets; and We shall say, “Taste the punishment of the fire!”
“This is the recompense of what your hands have sent ahead and Allah does not oppress the bondmen.”
Those who say, “Allah has agreed with us that we should not believe in any Noble Messenger until he comes with the command to offer a sacrifice, which a fire (from heaven) shall devour”; say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “Many Noble Messengers did come to you before me, with clear signs and with this command which you state – why did you then martyr them, if you are truthful?”
So O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) if they are denying you, Noble Messengers who came before you had also been denied, who had come with clear signs and Scriptures and the clear Book.
Every soul must taste death; and only on the Day of Resurrection will you be fully recompensed; so the one who is saved from the fire and is admitted into Paradise – he is undoubtedly successful; and the life of this world is just counterfeit wealth.
You will surely be tried in respect of your property and lives, and you will surely hear much wrong from those who were given the Book before you, and from the polytheists; and if you remain steadfast and remain pious, it is then an act of great courage.
And remember when Allah took a covenant from the People given the Book(s) that, “You shall definitely preach it to the people and not hide it”; so they flung it behind their backs and gained an abject price for it; so what a wretched bargain it is!
Do not ever think of those who rejoice for their deeds and wish to be praised without doing (good deeds) – do not ever think that they are safe from the punishment; and for them is a painful punishment.
And for Allah only is the kingship of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is Able to do all things.
Undoubtedly in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of night and day are signs for the intelligent.
Those who remember Allah while standing, and sitting, and reclining on their sides, and ponder about the creation of the heavens and the earth; “O our Lord! You have not created this without purpose; Purity is to You, therefore save us from the punishment of fire.”
“O our Lord! You have indeed given disgrace to whomever You put in the fire (of hell); and the unjust do not have any supporters.”
“O our Lord! We have heard a proclaimer calling towards faith, (saying) ‘Believe in your Lord’ so we have accepted faith; Our Lord!
Therefore forgive us our sins, and wipe out our evil deeds, and make us die among the virtuous.”
“O our Lord! And give us what You have promised us through Your Noble Messengers, and do not humiliate us on the Day of Resurrection; indeed You do not break the promise.”
So their Lord accepted their prayer, for I do not waste the efforts of any (righteous) worker, male or female; you are all one among yourselves; so those who migrated and were driven out from their homes and were harassed in My cause, and fought, and were slain – I will certainly wipe out all their sins and will certainly admit them into Gardens beneath which rivers flow; a reward from Allah; and only with Allah is the best reward.
O listener (followers of this Prophet)! Do not ever be deceived by the disbelievers’ free movements in the cities.
It is a brief usage; their home is hell; and what an evil resting-place!
But for those who fear their Lord are Gardens beneath which rivers flow – abiding in it for ever – the hospitality from their Lord; and that which is with Allah, is the best for the righteous.
And undoubtedly there are some among the People given the Book(s), who accept faith in Allah and what is sent down to you and what was sent down to them – their hearts are submitted humbly before Allah – they do not exchange the verses of Allah for an abject price; they are those whose reward is with their Lord; indeed Allah is Swift At Taking Account.
O People who Believe! Endure and surpass your enemies in endurance, and guard the frontiers of the Islamic nation; and keep fearing Allah, hoping that you may succeed.
O mankind! Fear your Lord Who created you from a single soul and from it created its spouse and from them both has spread the multitude of men and women; fear Allah in Whose name you claim (your rights from one another) and be mindful of your blood relations; indeed Allah is always seeing you.
And give the orphans their wealth and do not exchange the pure for the foul; and do not devour (or use up) their wealth, mixing it with your own; this is indeed a great sin.
And if you fear that you will not be just towards orphan girls, marry the women whom you like – two at a time, or three or four; then if you fear that you cannot keep two women equally then marry only one or the bondwomen you own; this is closer to your not doing injustice.
And give the women their bridal money willingly; then if they willingly give you a part of it, eat (use) it with joy and fruition.
And do not give the foolish their wealth which is in your custody – those for whom Allah has put you in charge to maintain (look after) – and feed and clothe them from it, and speak kindly to them.
And test the orphans till they are fit to get married (reach full age); then if you find them of proper judgement, hand over their wealth to them; and do not devour it by spending excessively and hastily, fearing that they will grow up; and whoever is not in need must abstain; and whoever is needy may use from it in a reasonable measure; and when you hand over their wealth to them, get witnesses over them; and Allah is Sufficient to take account.
For men is a share from what the parents and near relatives leave behind, and for women is a share from what the parents and near relatives leave behind, whether the wealth (inheritance) is small or large; the share is a fixed one.
And if relatives and orphans and the needy are present at the time of disbursement, give them something from it and speak to them with kindness.
And those people must fear, who if they die leaving behind them young children would be afraid for them; so they must fear Allah and speak with fairness.
Indeed those who unjustly devour the wealth of orphans only fill their bellies with fire; and soon they will go into a blazing pit.
Allah commands you concerning your children; the son’s share is equal to that of two daughters; and if there are only daughters, for them is two-thirds of the inheritance, even if they are more than two; and if there is only one daughter, for her is half; and to each of the deceased’s parents a sixth of the inheritance, if he has children; and if the deceased has no children but leaves behind parents, then one third for the mother; and if he has several brothers and sisters, a sixth for the mother, after any will he may have made and payment of debt; your fathers and your sons – you do not know which of them will be more useful to you; this is the share fixed by Allah; indeed Allah is All Knowing, Wise.
And from what your wives leave, half is for you if they do not have any child; or if they have a child for you is a fourth of what they leave, after any will they may have made or debt to be paid; and to the women is a fourth of what you leave behind, if you do not have any child; or if you have a child then an eighth of what you leave behind, after any will you may have made, or debt to be paid; and if a deceased does not leave behind a mother, father or children but has a brother or a sister through a common mother, then to each of them a sixth; and if they (brothers and sisters) are more than two, then they shall all share in a third, after any will that may have been made or debt to be paid, in which the deceased has not caused a loss (to the heirs); this is the decree of Allah; and Allah is All Knowing, Most Forbearing.
These are the limits of Allah; and whoever obeys Allah and His Noble Messenger – Allah will admit him into Gardens beneath which rivers flow – abiding in it forever; and this is the great success.
And whoever disobeys Allah and His Noble Messenger and crosses all His limits – Allah will put him in the fire (of hell), in which he will remain forever; and for him is a disgraceful punishment.
And take testimony from four chosen men amongst you, against the women among you who commit adultery; and if they testify, confine those women in the houses until death takes them away or Allah creates a solution for them.
And punish them both, the man and the woman, whoever are guilty of it (adultery); then if they repent and become pious, leave them; indeed Allah is the Most Acceptor Of Repentance, Most Merciful.
Undoubtedly the repentance which Allah has by His grace made obligatory upon Himself to accept, is only the repentance of those who commit sin in folly and then soon repent – towards them does Allah incline in mercy; and Allah is the All Knowing, the Wise.
And that repentance is not of those who constantly commit sins, and when death approaches one of them, he says, “I repent now”, nor of those who die as disbelievers; for them, We have kept prepared a painful punishment.
O People who Believe!
It is not lawful for you to forcibly become the women’s heirs; and do not restrain women with the intention of taking away a part of bridal money you gave them, unless they openly commit the shameful; and deal kindly with them; and if you do not like them, so it is possible that you dislike a thing in which Allah has placed abundant good.
And if you wish to change one wife for another and you have given her heaps of treasure, do not take back anything from it; will you take it back by slander and open sin?
And how will you take it back whereas you have become unveiled before each other, and they have taken a strong pledge from you?
And do not marry the women who were wedded to your fathers (and grand fathers), except what has already passed; that is indeed an act of shame and great wrong; and an evil way.
Forbidden for you are your mothers, and your daughters, and your sisters, and your father’s sisters, and your mother’s sisters, and your brothers’ daughters and your sisters’ daughters, and your foster-mothers (who breast-fed you), and their daughters (your foster-sisters), and your wives’ mothers (mothers-in-law), and your wives’ daughters who are under your protection – born of the women with whom you have cohabited; and if you have not cohabited with them, then it is no sin for you to marry their daughters; and (forbidden are) the wives of your own sons (and foster-sons and grandsons) and the keeping of two sisters together in marriage, except what has already passed; indeed Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
And all married women are forbidden for you except the wives of disbelievers who come into your possession as bondwomen; this is Allah’s decree for you; and other than these, all women are lawful for you so that you seek them in exchange of your wealth in proper wedlock, not adultery; therefore give the women you wish to marry, their appointed bridal money; and after the appointment (of bridal money) there is no sin on you if you come to a mutual agreement; indeed Allah is All Knowing, Wise.
And whoever among you does not have in marriage free, believing women due to poverty, should marry from the believing bondwomen you own; and Allah knows well your faith; you are from one another; therefore marry them with the permission of their masters, and give them their bridal money according to custom, they becoming (faithful) wives, not committing mischief or secretly making friends; so when they are married and commit the shameful, for them is half the punishment prescribed for free women; this is for one among you who fears falling into adultery; and to practice patience is better for you; and Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
Allah wills to explain His commands to you and show you the ways of those before you, and to incline towards you with His mercy; and Allah is All Knowing, Wise.
And Allah wills to incline towards you with His mercy; and those who pursue their own pleasures wish that you be far separated from the Straight Path.
Allah wills to lessen your burden; and man was created weak.
O People who Believe! Do not unjustly devour the property of each other, except through trade by mutual agreement; and do not kill one another; indeed Allah is Most Merciful upon you.
And whoever does that through injustice and oppression, We shall soon put him in the fire; and this is easy for Allah.
If you keep avoiding the cardinal sins that are forbidden to you, We will forgive you your other (lesser) sins and admit you into a noble place.
And do not long for things by which Allah has given superiority to some of you over others; for men is the share of what they earn; and for women the share from what they earn; and seek from Allah His munificence; indeed Allah knows everything.
And for all, We have appointed heirs – from whatever the parents and near relatives leave behind; and to those with whom you have made an agreement, give them their dues; indeed all things are present before Allah.
Men are in charge of women, as Allah has made one of them superior to the other, and because men spend their wealth for the women; so virtuous women are the reverent ones, guarding behind their husbands the way Allah has decreed guarding; and the women from whom you fear disobedience, (at first) advise them and (then) do not cohabit with them, and (lastly) beat them; then if they obey you, do not seek to do injustice to them; indeed Allah is Supreme, Great.
And if you fear a dispute between husband and wife, send an arbitrator from the man’s family and an arbitrator from the woman’s family; if these two wish conciliation, Allah will unite them; indeed Allah is All Knowing, Well Aware.
And worship Allah and do not ascribe any partner to Him, and be good to parents, and to relatives, and orphans, and the needy, and the related neighbour and the unrelated neighbour, and the close companion and the traveller; and your bondwomen; indeed Allah does not like any boastful, proud person. –
Those who are misers and preach miserliness to others, and hide what Allah has bestowed upon them from His munificence; and We have kept ready a disgraceful punishment for the disbelievers.
And those who spend their wealth in order for people to see, and do not accept faith in Allah nor the Last Day; and whoever has Satan (the devil) as a companion – so what an evil companion is he!
And what would they lose, if they had believed in Allah and the Last Day and spent from what Allah has bestowed upon them?
And Allah knows them very well.
Allah does not commit even the least injustice; and if there is a good deed, He doubles it and gives from Himself a great reward.
So how will it be when We bring a witness from each nation (religion), and We bring you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) as a witness and a watcher over them? (The Holy Prophet is a witness from Allah.)
On that day, those who disbelieved and disobeyed the Noble Messenger will wish that they be buried and the ground levelled above them; and they will not be able to hide anything from Allah.
O People who Believe! Do not approach the prayer when you are intoxicated until you have the sense to understand what you say, nor in the state of impurity until you have bathed except while travelling; and if you are ill or on a journey or one of you returns from answering the call of nature or you have cohabited with women, and you do not find water, then cleanse (yourself) with clean soil – therefore stroke your faces and your hands with it; indeed Allah is Most Pardoning, Oft Forgiving.
Did you not see those who received a portion of the Book, that they purchase error and wish that you too go astray from the right path?
Allah well knows your enemies; Allah is Sufficient as a Guardian, and Allah is Sufficient as a Supporter.
Some of the Jews interchange the words from their places and say, “We hear and disobey” – and they say “Hear- may you not be able to hear” – and they say “Raena (Be considerate towards us)” distorting it with their tongues and in order to slander religion; had they said, “We hear and we obey” and “Kindly listen to us, O dear Prophet,” and “Look mercifully upon us, O dear Prophet”, it would have been much better for them and more just – but Allah has cursed them for their disbelief; so they do not believe except a little.
O People given the Book(s)! Believe in what We have sent down confirming the Book which you possess, before We transform some faces so turning them towards their backs, or curse them like We had cursed the people of Sabth; and (know that) the Allah’s command is always carried out!
Undoubtedly Allah does not forgive (the sin of) disbelieving in Him and forgives anything lower than it to whomever He wills; and whoever ascribes partners to Allah has invented a tremendous sin.
Did you not see those who proclaim their piety (cleanliness of deeds)?
In fact Allah purifies whomever He wills, and no injustice, even equal to the hair upon a date seed will be done to them.
See how they fabricate lies against Allah!
And this is a sufficient manifest sin.
Did you not see those who received a portion of the Book, that they believe in idols and the devil, and say regarding the disbelievers that they are more rightly guided than the Muslims?
It is they whom Allah has cursed; and for those whom Allah has cursed, you (Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) will never find any supporter.
Do they have some share in the kingship?- if it were, they would not give to mankind even a single sesame.
Or do they envy people due to what Allah has given them from His grace?
In that case, We bestowed the Book and the wisdom upon the family of Ibrahim (Abraham), and We gave them a great kingdom.
So some of them believed in it and some of them turned away from it; and sufficient is hell, a blazing fire!
We shall soon put those who disbelieve in Our signs into the fire; whenever their skins are cooked (fully burnt) We shall change them for new skins so they may taste the punishment (again and again); indeed Allah is Almighty, Wise.
And those who believed and did good deeds, We shall soon admit them into Gardens beneath which rivers flow – abiding in it forever; in it for them are pure wives – and We shall admit them into places of plentiful shade.
Indeed Allah commands you to hand over whatever you hold in trust, to their owners – and that whenever you judge between people, judge with fairness; undoubtedly Allah gives you an excellent advice; indeed Allah is All Hearing, All Seeing.
O People who Believe!
Obey Allah and the Noble Messenger and those amongst you who are in authority; so if there is a dispute amongst you concerning any matter, refer it to Allah and the Noble Messenger (for judgement) if you believe in Allah and the Last Day; this is better and has the best outcome.
Did you not see those whose claim is that they believe in what has been sent down on you and what was sent down before you, and they then wish to make the devil their judge, whereas they were ordered to completely reject him? And the devil wishes to mislead them far astray.
And when they are told, “Come towards the Book sent down by Allah and to the Noble Messenger,” you will see that the hypocrites turn their faces away from you.
What will be their state, if some calamity befalls them as a result of what their own hands have sent before them – and then they come to you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), swearing by Allah that, “Our goal was only to do good and create harmony"?
The secrets of their hearts are well known to Allah; so avoid them and explain to them, and speak to them clearly in their affairs.
And We did not send any Noble Messenger except that he be obeyed by Allah’s command; and if they, when they have wronged their own souls, come humbly to you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) and seek forgiveness from Allah, and the Noble Messenger intercedes for them, they will certainly find Allah as the Most Acceptor Of Repentance, the Most Merciful.
So O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), by oath of your Lord, they will not be Muslims until they appoint you a judge for the disputes between them – and then whatever you have decided, they should not find opposition to it within their hearts, and they must accept it wholeheartedly.
And had We decreed for them to slay themselves or to leave their homes and families, only a few of them would have done it; and if they did what they are advised to, it would be good for them, and would have strengthened faith.
And were it so, We would bestow upon them a great reward from Ourselves.
And would certainly guide them to the Straight Path.
And whoever obeys Allah and His Noble Messenger, will be with those upon whom Allah has bestowed grace – that is, the Prophets and the truthful and the martyrs and the virtuous; and what excellent companions they are!
This is Allah’s munificence; and Allah is Sufficient, the All Knowing.
O People who Believe!
Be cautious, then advance towards the enemy in small numbers or all together.
Indeed among you is one who will certainly loiter behind; then if some disaster were to befall you, he would say, “It was Allah’s grace upon me that I was not present with them!”
And were you to receive Allah’s munificence (a bounty), he would surely say – as if there had been no friendship between you and him – “Alas – if only I had been with them, I would have achieved a great success!”
So those who sell the life of this world for the Hereafter, must fight in Allah's cause; and We shall bestow a great reward upon whoever fights in Allah's cause, whether he is martyred or is victorious.
And what is the matter with you, that you should not fight in Allah’s cause and for the feeble men, and women, and children, who invoke, “Our Lord! Liberate us from this town, the people of which are unjust; and give us a protector from Yourself; and give us a supporter from Yourself.”
The believers fight for Allah’s cause; and the disbelievers fight for the devil’s cause – so fight against the friends of the devil; undoubtedly the devil’s conspiracy is weak.
Did you not see those to whom it was said, “Restrain your hands, keep the prayer established and pay the charity”; but when fighting was ordained for them, some of them started fearing people, the way they feared Allah – or even greater! And they said, “Our Lord!
Why have You ordained fighting for us? If only You would have let us live some more!”
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “The usage of this world is meagre; and the Hereafter is better for the pious; and you will not be wronged even (the weight of) a single thread.”
Death will come to you wherever you may be, even if you were in strong fortresses; if some good reaches them they say, “This is from Allah”; and if any misfortune reaches them, they say, “This is from you”; say, “Everything is from Allah”; what is wrong with these people, that they do not seem to understand anything?
Whatever good reaches you, O listeners, is from Allah, and whatever ill reaches you is from yourselves; and We have sent you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) as a Noble Messenger towards all mankind; and Allah is Sufficient, as a Witness.
Whoever obeys the Noble Messenger has indeed obeyed Allah; and for those who turn away – We have not sent you as their saviour.
And they say, “We have obeyed”; and when they go away from you, a group of them spend the night conspiring against what they had said; and Allah records what they conspired by night; therefore O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) avoid them and rely upon Allah; and Allah is Sufficient as a Trustee (of affairs).
So do they not ponder about the Qur’an?
And had it been from anyone besides Allah, they would certainly find much contradiction in it.
And when any news of safety or fear comes to them, they speak of it publicly; and had they referred it to the Noble Messenger and to those among them having authority, those among them who are able to infer would certainly learn the truth of the matter from them; and were it not for Allah’s munificence upon you, and His mercy, all of you would have certainly followed Satan – except a few.
Therefore O dear Prophet, fight in Allah's cause; you will not be burdened except for yourself, and urge the believers (to fight); it is likely that Allah will curb the strength of the disbelievers; and Allah's strike is most stinging and His punishment the most severe.
Whoever makes a noble intercession will have a share of it, and whoever makes an evil intercession will have a share of it; and Allah is Able to do all things.
And when you are greeted with some words, greet back with words better than it or with the same; indeed Allah will take account of everything.
Allah! There is none worthy of worship except Him; He will surely gather you all on the Day of Resurrection in which there is no doubt; and whose Words are more true than those of Allah?
(Allah does not lie.)
So what is the matter with you that you got divided into two groups concerning the hypocrites, whereas Allah has inverted them because of their misdeeds?
Do you wish to guide one whom Allah has sent astray?
And for one whom Allah sends astray, you will not find a way.
They wish that you too should turn disbelievers the way they did, so that you all may become equal – so do not befriend any of them until they forsake their homes and families in Allah’s cause; then if they turn back, seize them and kill them wherever you find them; and do not take any of them as a friend nor as a supporter.
Except those who are related to the people between whom and you is a treaty, or who come to you with their hearts no longer having the will to fight you or to fight their own people; had Allah willed, He would certainly have given them power over you so that they would have surely fought you; then if they avoid you and do not wage war against you and make an offer of peace – then Allah has not kept for you a way against them.
You will now find others who desire that they should be safe from you and also safe from their own people; whenever their people turn them towards war, they fall headlong into it; so if they do not avoid (confronting) you nor submit an offer of peace nor restrain their hands, seize them and kill them wherever you find them; and they are the ones against whom We have given you clear authority.
It is not rightful for a Muslim to kill another Muslim, unless it occurs by mistake; and the one who mistakenly kills a Muslim must set free a Muslim slave and pay blood-money to the family of the slain, except if they forego it; and if the victim is of a people who are hostile to you, and the killer is a Muslim, then only the setting free of a Muslim slave (is obligatory); and if the victim is from a people between whom and you there is a treaty, then blood-money must be paid to his family and the setting free of a Muslim slave; therefore one who has no means must fast for two consecutive months; this is his penance before Allah; and Allah is All Knowing, Wise.
And whoever slays a Muslim on purpose, his reward will be hell – to remain in it for ages – and Allah has wreaked wrath upon him and has cursed him and kept prepared a terrible punishment for him.
O People who Believe! When you go forth to fight in holy war, make a proper study, and do not say to the one who greets you, “You are not a Muslim,” – you seek the means of this worldly life; so with Allah are the bounties in plenty; you too were like this before, then Allah bestowed His favour on you, therefore you must make a proper study; indeed Allah knows whatever you do.
The Muslims who stay back from holy war without proper excuse, are not equal to the Muslims who fight in Allah's cause with their wealth and lives; Allah has bestowed higher ranks to the warriors who strive with their wealth and lives, than those who stay back; and Allah has promised good to all; and Allah has favoured the warriors upon those who stay back, with a great reward.
Ranks (of honour) from Him, and forgiveness, and mercy; and Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
The angels ask the people whose souls they remove while they were wronging themselves, “What were you engaged in?”
They reply, “We were powerless in the land”; the angels say, “Was Allah’s earth not spacious enough for you to have migrated in it?”
The destination for such is hell; and a very wretched place to return.
Except those who were forcibly subdued among men, and the women and children, unable to devise a plan and unaware of the way.
So for such, it is likely that Allah will pardon them; and Allah is Most Pardoning, Oft Forgiving.
Whoever migrates for Allah's cause will find much shelter and abundant capacity in the earth; and whoever leaves his home, migrating towards Allah and His Noble Messenger, and death seizes him, his reward then lies entrusted with Allah; and Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
And when you travel in the land, it is no sin for you to curtail some of your obligatory prayers; if you fear that disbelievers may cause you harm; undoubtedly the disbelievers are open enemies to you.
And when you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) are among them and lead them in prayer, only a group of them should be with you, and they must keep their weapons with them; so when they have performed their prostrations they should move away behind you; and the other group that had not prayed, must come and offer prayers in your leadership, keeping their guard and weapons with them; the disbelievers wish that you neglect your arms and your means so they may overpower you with a single attack; it is no sin for you to lay aside your arms due to rain or if you are sick; and keep your guard; undoubtedly Allah has kept prepared a disgraceful punishment for the disbelievers.
So when you have offered your prayers remember Allah while standing, sitting and reclining; and when you feel secure, offer prayers in the usual manner; indeed prayers are a time bound obligatory duty upon the Muslims.
Do not relax in pursuit of the disbelievers; if you are suffering, they also suffer as you do; and you expect from Allah what they do not; and Allah is All Knowing, Wise.
We have indeed sent down the true Book towards you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), so that you may judge between men, in the way Allah may show you; and do not plead on behalf of the treacherous.
And seek forgiveness from Allah; indeed Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
And do not plead on behalf of those who deceive themselves; indeed Allah does not like any treacherous, excessive sinner.
They hide from men and do not hide from Allah, whereas Allah is with them when they plan in their hearts that which displeases Him; and Allah has their deeds encompassed.
Pay heed!
It is you people who argued on their behalf in the life of this world; so who will fight on their behalf with Allah on the Day of Resurrection, or who will be their pleader?
And whoever does evil or wrongs his own soul and then seeks forgiveness from Allah, will find Allah Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
And whoever earns sin, his earnings will only be against himself; and Allah is the Knowing, Wise.
And whoever commits a mistake or a sin, then blames it on someone innocent has indeed burdened himself with infamy and a manifest crime.
And O dear Prophet, were it not for Allah’s munificence and His mercy upon you, a group among them would have wished to deceive you; and they only mislead themselves and will not harm you at all; and Allah has sent down upon you the Book and wisdom, and taught you all what you did not know*; and upon you is Allah’s great munificence. (Allah gave the knowledge of the hidden to the Holy Prophet – peace and blessings be upon him.)
Most of their discussions do not contain any good, except of the one who enjoins charity or goodness or peace-making among people; whoever does that to seek the pleasure of Allah – We shall soon give him a great reward.
And whoever opposes the Noble Messenger after the right path has been made clear to him, and follows a way other than that of the Muslims, We shall leave him as he is, and put him in hell; and what a wretched place to return!
Allah does not forgive (the greatest sin) that partners be ascribed with Him – and He forgives all that is below (lesser sins) it, to whomever He wills; and whoever ascribes partners with Allah has indeed wandered far astray.
The polytheists do not worship Allah, except some females; and they do not worship anyone except the rebellious Satan.
The one whom Allah has cursed; and the devil said, “I swear, I will certainly take an appointed portion of Your bondmen,” –
“And I will surely lead them astray, and I will certainly arouse desires in them, and I will definitely order them so they will pierce animals’ ears, and I will definitely order them so they will alter Allah’s creation”; and whoever chooses the devil for a friend instead of Allah, has indeed suffered a manifest loss.
The devil promises them and arouses desires in them; and the devil does not give them promises except of deceit.
The destination for such is hell; they will not find any refuge from it.
And those who believed and did good deeds – We shall soon admit them into Gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding in them for ever and ever; a true promise from Allah; and whose Words are more true than those of Allah? (Allah does not lie.)
The affair does not rest on your thoughts, nor the cravings of the People given the Book(s); whoever does wrong will get the recompense of it – and will not find, other than Allah, any friend or any supporter.
And whoever does some good deeds, be it a man or woman, and is a Muslim, will be admitted to Paradise and they will not be wronged even to the extent of one sesame.
And whose religion is better than one who submits his self to Allah and is virtuous and follows the religion of Ibrahim, who was far removed from all falsehood?
And Allah made Ibrahim His close friend.
And to Allah only belongs all whatever is in the heavens and all whatever is in the earth; and Allah has control over all things.
And they ask you the decree concerning women; say, “Allah gives you a decree concerning them – and what is recited to you from the Qur’an concerning orphan girls, that you are not giving them which is ordained for them, and you are avoiding marrying them – and concerning the weak children, and that you must firmly establish justice in dealing with the orphans’ rights; and whatever good deeds you do, then Allah is Well Aware of it.”
And if a woman fears ill treatment from her husband or disinterest, so it is no sin for them if they reach an agreement of peace between themselves; and peace is better; and the heart is trapped in greed; and if you do good and practice piety, then Allah is Well Aware of it.
And you will never be able to deal equally between women however much you may desire – therefore do not be totally inclined towards one leaving the other in uncertainty; and if you do good and practice piety, then (know that) Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
And if the two separate, Allah will make each one independent of the other, with His Capability; and Allah is Most Capable, Wise.
And to Allah only belongs all whatever is in the heavens and all whatever is in the earth; and indeed We have commanded those who received the Books before you, and commanded you, that keep fearing Allah; and if you disbelieve, undoubtedly to Allah only belongs all whatever is in the heavens and all whatever is in the earth; and Allah is Independent, Worthy Of All Praise.
And to Allah only belongs all whatever is in the heavens and all whatever is in the earth; and Allah is Sufficient as a Trustee (of affairs).
O people! He can remove you and bring others, if He wills; and Allah is Able to do that.
Whoever desires the reward of this world, then with Allah only lie both – the rewards of this world and of the Hereafter; and Allah is All Hearing, All Seeing.
O People who Believe!
Be firm in establishing justice, giving witness for Allah, even if it is harmful to yourselves or parents or relatives; whether the one you testify against is wealthy or poor, for in any case Allah has the greater right over it; then do not follow your wishes for you may stray from the truth; and if you distort testimony or turn away, then Allah is Well Aware of your deeds.
O People who Believe! Have faith in Allah and His Noble Messenger and the Book He has sent down upon this Noble Messenger of His, and the Book He sent down before; and whoever does not accept faith in Allah and His angels and His Books and His Noble Messengers and the Last Day, has undoubtedly wandered far astray.
Indeed those who believe, then disbelieve and then again believe, then again disbelieve, and go further in their disbelief – Allah will never forgive them, nor ever guide them to the path.
Give glad tidings to the hypocrites, that for them is a painful punishment.
Those who leave the Muslims to befriend the disbelievers; do they seek honour from them?
Then (know that) undoubtedly all honour is for Allah.
And indeed Allah has sent down to you in the Book that whenever you hear the signs of Allah being rejected or being made fun of, do not sit with those people, until they engage in some other conversation; or else you too are like them; undoubtedly Allah will gather the hypocrites and the disbelievers, all together, into hell.
Those who keep watching your circumstances; so if a victory comes to you from Allah, they say, “Were we not with you?”; and if victory is for disbelievers, they say, “Did we not have control over you, and protect you from the Muslims?”
Allah will judge between you all on the Day of Resurrection; and Allah will not provide the disbelievers any way over the Muslims.
Undoubtedly the hypocrites, in their fancy, seek to deceive Allah whereas He will extinguish them while making them oblivious; and when they stand up for prayer, they do it unwillingly and for others to see, and they do not remember Allah except a little.
Fluctuating in the middle; neither here (in faith) nor there (in disbelief); and for one whom Allah sends astray, you will not find a way.
O People who Believe! Do not befriend disbelievers in place of Muslims; do you wish to give Allah a clear proof against you?
Undoubtedly the hypocrites are in the deepest segment of hell; and you will never find any supporter for them.
Except those who repented and reformed themselves and held fast to Allah’s rope and made their religion sincerely only for Allah – so they are with the Muslims; and Allah will soon bestow upon the believers a great reward.
And what will Allah gain by punishing you, if you acknowledge the truth and accept faith?
And Allah is Most Appreciative, All Knowing.
Allah does not like disclosure of evil matters except by the oppressed; and Allah is All Hearing, All Knowing.
If you do any good openly or in secret, or pardon someone’s evil – then indeed Allah is Oft Forgiving, Able.
Those who disbelieve in Allah and His Noble Messengers, and seek to cause division between Allah and His Noble Messengers, and say, “We believe in some and disbelieve in others,” and wish to choose a way between faith and disbelief; –
These are the real disbelievers; and for the disbelievers We have kept prepared a disgraceful punishment.
And those who believe in Allah and all His Noble Messengers and do not make any distinction in belief between any of them – to them Allah will soon give them their reward; and Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) the People given the Book(s) ask you, to cause a Book to be sent down on them from heaven – so they had asked something even greater from Moosa, for they said, “Show Allah to us, clearly” – so the thunder seized them on account of their sins; then they chose the calf (for worship) after clear signs had come to them, then We forgave this; and We bestowed Moosa with a clear dominance.
We then raised the mount (Sinai) above them to take a covenant from them and decreed them that, “Enter the gate while prostrating” and decreed them that, “Do not cross the limits of the Sabbath,” and We took from them a firm covenant.
So Allah cursed them because of their constantly breaking their covenant – and they disbelieved in the signs of Allah, and they used to wrongfully martyr the Prophets, and because they said, “Our hearts are covered”; in fact Allah has set a seal upon their hearts due to their disbelief, so that they do not accept faith, except a few.
And because they disbelieved and slandered Maryam with a tremendous accusation.
And because they said, “We have killed the Messiah, Eisa the son of Maryam, the Messenger of Allah”; they did not slay him nor did they crucify him, but a look-alike was created for them; and those who disagree concerning it are in doubt about it; they know nothing of it, except the following of assumptions; and without doubt, they did not kill him.
In fact Allah raised him towards Himself; and Allah is Almighty, Wise.
There is not one of the People given the Book(s), who will not believe in him (Eisa) before his death; and on the Day of Resurrection he will be a witness against them.
So due to the great injustices committed by the Jews, We forbade them some of the good things which were earlier lawful for them, and because they prevented many people from Allah’s way.
And because they used to take usury whereas they were forbidden from it, and they used to wrongfully devour people’s wealth; and for the disbelievers among them, We have kept prepared a painful punishment.
But those among them who are firm in knowledge and who have faith, believe in what is sent down upon you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), and what was sent down before you, and those who keep the prayer established and those who pay the charity, and those who believe in Allah and the Last Day; to such, We shall soon bestow a great reward.
Indeed We sent a divine revelation to you (Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessing be upon him) as We did send divine revelations to Nooh (Noah) and the Prophets after him; and We sent divine revelations to Ibrahim (Abraham) and Ismael (Ishmael) and Ishaq (Isaac) and Yaqub (Jacob) and their offspring, and Eisa (Jesus) and Ayyub (Job) and Yunus (Jonah) and Haroon (Aaron) and Sulaiman (Solomon), and We bestowed the Zaboor (the Holy Book) upon Dawud (David).
And to the Noble Messengers whom We have mentioned to you before, and to the Noble Messengers We have not mentioned to you; and Allah really did speak to Moosa.
Noble Messengers giving glad tidings and declaring warnings, in order that people may not have any argument against Allah, after the (advent of) Noble Messengers; and Allah is Almighty, Wise.
But Allah is the Witness of what He has sent down upon you – He has sent it down by His knowledge; and the angels are witnesses; and sufficient is Allah’s testimony.
Indeed those who disbelieved and prevented (others) from the way of Allah, have undoubtedly wandered far astray.
Indeed those who disbelieved and crossed the limits – Allah will never forgive them, nor guide them to a way.
Except the path of hell, in which they will remain for ever and ever; and that is easy for Allah.
O mankind! This Noble Messenger (Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) has come to you with the truth from your Lord, so accept faith for your own good; and if you disbelieve, then undoubtedly to Allah only belongs all whatever is in the heavens and in the earth; and Allah is All Knowing, Wise.
O People given the Book(s)! Do not exaggerate in your religion nor say anything concerning Allah, but the truth; the Messiah, Eisa the son of Maryam, is purely a Noble Messenger of Allah, and His Word; which He sent towards Maryam, and a Spirit from Him; so believe in Allah and His Noble Messengers; and do not say “Three”; desist, for your own good; undoubtedly Allah is the only One God; Purity is to Him from begetting a child; to Him only belongs all whatever is in the heavens and all whatever is in the earth; and Allah is a Sufficient Trustee (of affairs).
The Messiah does not at all hate being a bondman of Allah, and nor do the close angels; and whoever hates worshipping Him and is conceited – so very soon He will gather them all towards Him.
Then to those who believed and did good deeds, He will pay their wages in full and by His munificence, give them more; and to those who hated (worshipping Him) and were proud, He will inflict a painful punishment; and they will not find for themselves, other than Allah, any supporter nor any aide.
Indeed the clear proof from your Lord has come to you, and We have sent down to you a bright light. (The Holy Prophet is a Clear Proof from Allah.)
So those who believed in Allah and held fast to His rope – He will admit them into His mercy and munificence, and will guide them on the Straight Path towards Himself.
O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), they ask you for a decree; say, “Allah decrees you concerning the solitary person (without parents or children); if a man dies childless and has a sister, for her is half the inheritance; and the man is his sister’s heir if the sister dies childless; and if there are two sisters, for them is two-thirds of the inheritance; so if there are brothers and sisters, both men and women, the male’s share is equal to that of two females; and Allah explains clearly to you, so that you do not go astray; and Allah knows all things.”
O People who Believe!
Fulfil your words (agreements); the mute animals are made lawful for you (to eat) except what will be declared to you after this, but do not assume hunting as lawful when you are on the pilgrimage; indeed Allah commands whatever He wills.
O People who Believe! Do not make lawful the symbols of Allah nor the sacred months nor the sacrificial animals sent to Sacred Territory (around Mecca) nor the animals marked with garlands, nor the lives and wealth of those travelling towards the Sacred House (Kaa’bah) seeking the munificence and pleasure of their Lord; and when you have completed the pilgrimage, you may hunt; and let not the enmity of the people who had stopped you from going to the Sacred Mosque tempt you to do injustice; and help one another in righteousness and piety – and do not help one another in sin and injustice – and keep fearing Allah; indeed Allah’s punishment is severe.
Forbidden for you are carrion, and blood, and flesh of swine, and that which has been slaughtered while proclaiming the name of any other than Allah, and one killed by strangling, and one killed with blunt weapons, and one which died by falling, and that which was gored by the horns of some animal, and one eaten by a wild beast, except those whom you slaughter; and (also forbidden is) that which is slaughtered at the altar (of idols) and that which is distributed by the throwing of arrows (as an omen); this is an act of sin; this day, the disbelievers are in despair concerning your religion, so do not fear them and fear Me; this day have I perfected your religion for you* and completed My favour upon you, and have chosen Islam as your religion; so whoever is forced by intense hunger and thirst and does not incline towards sin, then indeed Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful. (*Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him – is the Last Prophet.)
They ask you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) what is made lawful for them; say, “Pure things are made lawful for you, and the beasts (and birds) of prey which you have trained and use for hunting, (and) you teach them what Allah has taught you; so eat what they kill and leave for you, and mention Allah’s name upon it – and keep fearing Allah; indeed Allah is Swift At Taking Account.”
This day the pure things are made lawful for you; and the food of the People given the Book(s) is lawful for you – and your food is lawful for them – and likewise are the virtuous Muslim women and the virtuous women from the people who received the Book(s) before you when you give them their bridal money – marrying them, not committing adultery nor as mistresses; and whoever turns a disbeliever after being a Muslim, all his deeds are wasted and he will be among the losers in the Hereafter.
O People who Believe! When you wish to stand up for prayer, wash your faces, and your hands up to the elbows, and pass wet palms over your heads and wash your feet up to the ankles; and if you need a bath, clean yourselves thoroughly; and if you are sick or on a journey, or one of you returns from answering the call of nature, or you have cohabited with women, and you do not find water, then cleanse (yourself) with clean soil – therefore stroke your soiled palms over your faces and your hands with it; Allah does not will to place you in hardship, but He wills to fully purify you and complete His favour upon you, so that you may be grateful.
And remember Allah’s favour upon you and the covenant He took from you when you said, “We hear and we obey” – and fear Allah; indeed Allah knows what lies within the hearts.
O People who Believe! Firmly establish the commands of Allah, giving testimony with justice – and do not let the enmity of anyone tempt you not to do justice; be just; that is nearer to piety – and fear Allah; indeed Allah is Well Aware of your deeds.
It is Allah’s promise to those who believe and are righteous, that for them will be forgiveness and a great reward.
And those who disbelieve and deny Our signs – it is they who are the people of hell.
O People who Believe!
Remember Allah’s favour upon you, when a people wished to extend their hands against you, so He restrained their hands from you; and keep fearing Allah; and Muslims must rely only upon Allah.
Undoubtedly Allah made a covenant with the Descendants of Israel, and We appointed twelve chiefs among them; and Allah said, “Indeed I am with you; surely, if you establish the prayer and pay the charity, and believe in My Noble Messengers and respect* them, and lend an excellent loan to Allah, I will surely forgive your sins, and I will surely admit you into Gardens beneath which rivers flow; then after this, if any of you disbelieves, he has certainly gone astray from the Straight Path."
(To honour the Holy Prophet – peace and blessings be upon him – is part of faith. To disrespect him is blasphemy.)
So We cursed them because of them constantly breaking their covenant, and hardened their hearts; they shift the Words of Allah from their places, and have forgotten a large portion of the advices that were given to them; and you will constantly learn of deceits from them, except a few; so forgive them and excuse them; indeed Allah loves the virtuous.
And We made a covenant with those who proclaimed, “We are Christians” – they then forgot a large portion of the advices given to them; We have therefore instilled enmity and hatred between them till the Day of Resurrection; and Allah will soon inform them of what they were doing.
O People given the Book(s)! Indeed this Noble Messenger (Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) of Ours has come to you, revealing to you a lot of the things which you had hidden in the Book, and forgiving a lot of them; indeed towards you has come a light* from Allah, and a clear Book. (* The Holy Prophet is a light from Allah).
With it, Allah guides whoever obeys the will of Allah to the paths of peace, and takes them out of darkness towards light by His command, and guides them to the Straight Path.
They have indeed become disbelievers who say, “Messiah, the son of Maryam is certainly Allah”; say, “Who can then do anything against Allah, if He wills to destroy the Messiah, the son of Maryam, and his mother and everyone on earth?”
And for Allah only is the kingship of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them; He creates whatever He wills; and Allah is Able to do all things.
The Jews and the Christians said, “We are the sons of Allah and His beloved ones”; say, “Why does He then punish you for your sins? In fact you are human beings, part of His creation; He forgives whomever He wills, and punishes whomever He wills; and for Allah only is the kingship of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them – and towards Him is the return.”
O People given the Book(s)! Indeed this Noble Messenger (Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) of Ours has come to you, revealing to you Our commands, after the Noble Messengers had stopped arriving for ages, for you might claim, “Never did any Harbinger of Glad Tidings or Herald of Warning come to us” – so this Harbinger of Glad Tidings and Herald of Warning has come to you; and Allah is Able to do all things.
And when Moosa said to his people, “O my people! Remember Allah’s favour upon you, that He created Prophets among you, and made you kings, and has now given you what He has not given to any one else in this world.”
“O my people! Enter the holy land which Allah has decreed for you and do not turn back, for you will turn back as losers.”
They said, “O Moosa! In it lives a very strong nation – and we shall never enter it, until they have gone away from there; so when they have gone away from there, we will enter it.”
So two men who were among those who feared Allah and whom Allah had favoured said, “Enter upon them by force, through the gate; if you enter the gate, victory will be yours; and depend only upon Allah, if you have faith.”
They said, “O Moosa! We will never enter it whilst they are there, so you and your Lord go and fight – we shall remain seated here.”
I have no control except over myself and my brother, so keep us separated from the disobedient nation.” (Do not count us among them).
Said Allah, “The (holy) land is therefore forbidden for them for forty years; they will wander in the earth; so do not grieve for these disobedient people.”
And recite to them the true tale of the two sons of Adam; when both of them offered a sacrifice each – hence the sacrifice of one was accepted and not accepted from the other; he (the other) said, “I swear I will kill you”; he answered, “Allah accepts only from the pious.”
“Indeed, if you do extend your hand against me to kill me, I will not extend my hand against you to kill you; I fear Allah, the Lord Of The Creation.”
“I only desire that you alone should bear my sin and your own sin – hence you become of the people of hell; and that is the proper punishment of the unjust.”
So his soul incited him to kill his brother – he therefore killed him, and was therefore ruined.
So Allah sent a crow scratching the ground, to show him how to hide his brother’s corpse; he said, “Woe to me!
I was not even capable enough to be like this crow, so I would hide my brother’s corpse”; and he turned remorseful.
For this reason; We decreed for the Descendants of Israel that whoever kills a human being except in lieu of killing or causing turmoil in the earth, so it shall be as if he had killed all mankind; and whoever saves the life of one person, is as if he had saved the life of all mankind; and undoubtedly Our Noble Messengers came to them with clear proofs – then after this indeed many of them are oppressors in the earth.
The only reward of those who make war upon Allah and His Noble Messenger and cause turmoil in the land is that they be all be killed or crucified, or their hands and feet cut off from alternate sides, or they be banished far away from the land; this is their degradation in the world, and for them in the Hereafter is a great punishment.
Except those who repent before you apprehend them; so know well that Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
O People who Believe! Fear Allah, and seek the means towards Him, and strive in His cause, in the hope of attaining success.
Indeed if the disbelievers owned all that is in the earth and a similar one in addition to it, and they offered it as a ransom to save themselves from the punishment of the Day of Resurrection, it would not be accepted from them; and for them is a painful punishment.
They will wish to come out of hell, and will not come out of it – and for them is an unending punishment.
And cut off the hands of those men or women who are thieves – a recompense of their deeds, a punishment from Allah; and Allah is Almighty, Wise.
So if one repents after his wrongdoing and reforms himself, Allah will incline towards him with His mercy; indeed Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
Do you not know that to Allah only belongs the kingship of the heavens and the earth?
He punishes whomever He wills, and forgives whomever He wills; and Allah is Able to do all things.
O Noble Messenger (Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him)! Do not let yourself be aggrieved by the people who rush towards disbelief – those who say with their mouths, “We believe” but whose hearts are not Muslims; and some Jews; they listen a great deal to falsehood, and to other people who do not come to you; shifting Allah’s Words from their correct places; and say, “If this command is given to you, obey it, but if this is not given to you, then refrain”; and the one whom Allah wills to send astray, you will never be able to help him in the least against Allah; they are those whose hearts Allah did not will to cleanse; for them is disgrace in this world, and for them is a great punishment in the Hereafter.
The excessively eager listeners of falsehood, extreme devourers of the forbidden; so if they come humbly to you (Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), judge between them or shun them; and if you turn away from them they cannot harm you at all; and if you do judge between them, judge with fairness; indeed Allah loves the equitable.
And why should they wish to be judged by you, when they have the Taurat with them, in which exist the commands of Allah and yet they turn away from it? And they will not accept faith.
Undoubtedly We sent down the Taurat, in which is guidance and light; the Jews were commanded according to it by Our obedient Prophets, and the rabbis and the religious jurists for they were commanded to protect Allah’s Book, and were witnesses to it; so do not fear men, and fear Me, and do not exchange My verses for an abject price; and whoever does not judge according to what is sent down by Allah – it is they who are disbelievers.
And in the Taurat, We made it obligatory upon them that, “A life (is the retribution) for a life, and an eye for an eye, and a nose for a nose, and an ear for an ear, and a tooth for a tooth, and for wounds is a retribution”; then whoever willingly agrees to retribution, it shall redeem him of his sin; and whoever does not judge according to what is sent down by Allah – it is they who are the unjust.
And We brought Eisa the son of Maryam, following the footsteps of those Prophets, confirming the Taurat which preceded him – and We bestowed upon him the Injeel (Bible) in which is guidance and light, and confirms the Taurat which preceded it, and a guidance and an advice to the pious.
And the People of Injeel must judge by what Allah has sent down in it; and whoever does not judge according to what is sent down by Allah – it is they who are the sinners.
And O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) We have sent down the true Book upon you, confirming the Books preceding it, and a protector and witness over them – therefore judge between them according to what is sent down by Allah, and O listener, do not follow their desires, abandoning the truth which has come to you; We have appointed for you all, a separate (religious) law and a way; and had Allah willed He could have made you one nation, but the purpose (His will) is to test you by what He has given you, therefore seek to surpass one another in good deeds; towards Allah only you will all return, so He will inform you concerning the matter in which you disputed.
And therefore, O Muslims, judge between them according to what is sent down by Allah, and do not follow their desires, and be cautious of them so that they may not divert you from some commands which have been sent down to you; then if they turn away, know that Allah’s will is to punish them for some of their sins; and indeed many men are disobedient.
So do they wish a judgement of ignorance?
And whose judgement is better than that of Allah, for the people who are certain?
O People who Believe! Do not make the Jews and the Christians your friends; they are friends of one another; and whoever among you befriends them, is one of them; indeed Allah does not guide the unjust.
You will now see those in whose hearts is a disease, that they rush towards the Jews and the Christians, saying, “We fear that a misfortune will possibly befall us”; so it is likely that Allah may soon bring victory, or a command from Himself, so they will remain regretting what they had hidden in their hearts.
And the believers say, “Are these the ones who swore by Allah most vehemently in their oaths, that they are with you?”
All their deeds are destroyed, so they are ruined.
O People who Believe! Whoever among you reneges from his religion, so Allah will soon bring a people who are His beloved ones and Allah is their beloved, lenient with the Muslims and stern towards disbelievers – they will strive in Allah’s cause, and not fear the criticism of any accuser; this is Allah’s munificence, He may give to whomever He wills; and Allah is the Most Capable, the All Knowing.
You do not have any friends except Allah and His Noble Messenger and the believers who establish the prayer and pay the charity, and are bowed down before Allah.
And whoever takes Allah and His Noble Messenger and the Muslims as friends – so undoubtedly only the party of Allah is victorious.
O People who Believe! Those who have made your religion a mockery and a sport, and those who received the Book before you, and the disbelievers – do not befriend any of them; and keep fearing Allah, if you have faith.
And when you call to prayer, they mock and make fun of it; this is because they are people without any sense.
Say, “O People given the Book(s)! What do you dislike in us – except that we believe in Allah and what is sent down to us and what was sent down before, and because most of you are disobedient?”
Say, “Shall I tell you of those who are in a worse position than this, in Allah’s sight?
It is those whom Allah has cursed and has wreaked His wrath upon and turned some of them into apes and swine, and worshippers of the devil; theirs is a worse destination and they have wandered further astray from the Straight Path.”
And when they come to you, they say, “We are Muslims” whereas they were disbelievers when they came in, and disbelievers when they went out; and Allah knows very well, what they hide.
And you will see many of them rushing towards sin and oppression, and to devour the forbidden; undoubtedly what they do is extremely evil.
Why do not their priests and monks forbid them from speaking evil and devouring the forbidden?
Undoubtedly what they do is extremely evil.
And the Jews said, “Allah’s hand is tied"; may their hands be tied – and they are accursed for saying so! In fact, both His hands* are free, He bestows upon whomever He wills; and O dear Prophet, this Book which has been sent down upon you from your Lord will cause many of them to advance in their rebellion and disbelief; and We have instilled enmity and hatred between them till the Day of Resurrection; whenever they ignite the flame of war, Allah extinguishes it, and they strive to create chaos in the land; and Allah does not love the mischievous. (* This is a metaphor used to express Allah’s power).
If the People given the Book(s) had accepted faith and been pious, We would have certainly redeemed them of their sins and would have certainly taken them into serene Gardens.
And had they kept the Taurat and the Injeel established, and what was sent down towards them from their Lord, they would have received sustenance from above and from beneath their feet; among them is a group who is fair; but most of them commit extremely evil deeds.
O Noble Messenger (Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him)!
Convey all what has been sent down upon you from your Lord; and if you do not, then you have not conveyed any of His messages; and Allah will protect you from the people; indeed Allah does not guide the disbelievers.
Say, “O People given the Book(s)! You are nothing until you establish the Taurat and the Injeel, and what was sent down towards you from your Lord”; and this Book which has been sent down upon you from your Lord will cause many of them to advance in their rebellion and disbelief; so do not at all grieve for the disbelievers.
Indeed those who call themselves Muslims – and similarly among the Jews, and the Sabeans, and the Christians* – whoever sincerely accepts faith in Allah and the Last Day, and does good deeds – so there shall be no fear upon them nor shall they grieve. (Whoever among them converts to Islam).
We made a covenant with the Descendants of Israel and sent Noble Messengers towards them; whenever a Noble Messenger came to them with whatever was not according to their own desires, they denied some of them and some they slew.
And they assumed that there will be no punishment, so they turned blind and deaf – then Allah accepted their penance, then again many of them turned blind and deaf; and Allah is seeing their deeds.
They are certainly disbelievers who say, “Allah is actually the Messiah, the son of Maryam”; whereas the Messiah had said, “O Descendants of Israel, worship Allah Who is my Lord and (also) your Lord”; undoubtedly whoever ascribes partners with Allah, then Allah has forbidden Paradise for him; his destination is hell; and the unjust do not have any supporters.
They are certainly disbelievers who say, “Indeed Allah is the third of the three Gods”; whereas there is no God except the One God; and if they do not desist from their speech, undoubtedly a painful punishment will reach those among them who die as disbelievers.
So why do they not incline towards Allah and seek His forgiveness?
And Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
The Messiah, the son of Maryam, is purely a Noble Messenger; many Noble Messengers have passed before him; and his mother is a truthful woman; they both used to eat food; see how We make the signs clear for them, and see how they turn away!
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “What! You worship, other than Allah, that which is neither the controller of your losses nor of your benefits?
And Allah only is the All Hearing, the All Knowing.”
Say, “O People given the Book(s)! Do not wrongfully commit injustice in your religion, and do not follow the people who earlier went astray, and led many others astray, and wandered away from the Straight Path.”
Those among the Descendants of Israel who turned disbelievers were cursed by the tongue of Dawud, and of Eisa the son of Maryam; it was because of their disobedience and their rebellion.
They did not restrain one another from the evil they used to do; undoubtedly they used to commit extremely evil deeds.
You will see that many of them make friends with the disbelievers; what an evil thing they had sent ahead for themselves, for Allah’s wrath came upon them and they will remain in the punishment, forever.
Had they believed in Allah and this Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) and what is sent down upon him, they would not befriend the disbelievers, but most of them are disobedient.
You will certainly find the Jews and the polytheists as the greatest enemies of the Muslims; and you will find the closest in friendship to the Muslims those who said, “We are Christians”; that is because scholars and monks are among them, and they are not proud.
And when they listen to what has been sent down to the Noble Messenger (Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), you observe their eyes overflowing with tears because they have recognised the truth; they say, “Our Lord, we have accepted faith – therefore record us among the witnesses of the truth.”
“And what is the matter with us, that we should not believe in Allah and this truth which has come to us? And we hope that our Lord will admit us along with the righteous.”
So because of their saying, Allah bestowed them with Gardens beneath which rivers flow, in which they will abide forever; and this is the reward of the virtuous.
And those who disbelieved and denied Our signs, are the people of hell.
O People who Believe! Do not forbid the pure things, which Allah has made lawful for you, and do not cross the limits; indeed Allah dislikes the transgressors.
Eat of the sustenance which Allah has given you, the lawful and the pure – and fear Allah in Whom you believe.
Allah does not take you to task for oaths which are made unintentionally but He does take you to task for oaths which you ratify; so the redemption of such oaths is to provide food to ten needy persons equal to the average of what you feed your family, or to clothe them, or to free one slave; and for one who has no means, is the fasting for three days; this is the redemption of your oaths when you have sworn; and fulfil your oaths; this is how Allah explains His verses to you, so that you may be thankful.
O People who Believe!
Wine (all intoxicants), and gambling, and idols, and the darts are impure – the works of Satan, therefore keep avoiding them so that you may succeed.
The devil only seeks to instil hatred and enmity between you with wine and gambling, and to prevent you from the remembrance of Allah and from prayer; so have you desisted?
And obey Allah and obey the Noble Messenger, and be cautious; then if you turn away, so know that the duty of Our Noble Messenger is only to plainly convey the message.
Upon those who accepted faith and did good deeds, there shall be no sin for whatever they have consumed in the past, provided they fear and continue to believe and do good deeds, then again fear and continue to believe, and then again fear and remain virtuous; and Allah loves the virtuous.
O People who Believe!
Allah will surely test you with some prey that is within reach of your hands and your spears, so that Allah may make known those who fear Him without seeing; so henceforth, a painful punishment is for anyone who transgresses.
O People who Believe! Do not kill prey while you are on the pilgrimage; and whoever among you kills it intentionally, so its recompense is that he shall give a similar domestic animal (for sacrifice), two honest men among you rendering the command, the sacrifice being brought to the Kaa’bah – or he gives as redemption, food for some needy persons, or fasts for the same number of days, so that he may taste the consequences of his deed; Allah has forgiven what has passed; and henceforth whoever does it, Allah will take recompense from him; and Allah is Almighty, Avenger.
It is lawful for you to hunt from the sea and to eat from it, for your benefit and that of the travellers; and hunting on land is forbidden for you while you are on the pilgrimage; and fear Allah, towards Whom you will arise.
Allah has made the Kaa’bah, the respected house, a cause for peoples survival, and the Sacred Month, and the sacrifices in the holy land, and the garlanded animals; this is so that you may be convinced that Allah knows all whatever is in the heavens and all whatever is in the earth, and that Allah is the All Knowing.
Know well that Allah’s punishment is severe, and that Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
There is no duty upon the Noble Messenger except to convey the command; and Allah knows all what you disclose and all what you hide.
Say, “The impure (evil) and the pure (good) are not equal, even though the abundance of the impure may attract you; therefore keep fearing Allah, O men of intellect, so that you may succeed.”
O People who Believe!
Do not ask about matters which, if disclosed to you, would be disliked by you; and if you ask about them while the Qur’an is being sent down, they will be disclosed to you; Allah has forgiven these; and Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Forbearing.
A nation before you asked about such matters and then disbelieved in them.
Allah has not appointed (commanded to sacrifice) the camel with ears sliced (Bahira) or the she-camel (Saibah) or the she-goat (Wasilah) or the breeding camel (Hami), but the disbelievers fabricate lies against Allah; and most of them do not have any sense at all.
And when it is said to them, “Come towards what Allah has sent down and towards the Noble Messenger”, they say, “Sufficient for us is what we found our forefathers upon”; even if their forefathers did not have knowledge nor had guidance?
O People who Believe!
Fear for your own souls; he who has strayed cannot harm you in the least if you are on guidance; towards Allah only you will all return – He will then inform you of what you used to do.
O People who Believe!
The witnesses between you when death approaches any one of you, at the time of making a will, should be two reliable men from among you, or two from another tribe in case you are travelling in the land and the event of death approaches you; engage them after the prayers, and if you doubt, they must swear by Allah that, “We shall not exchange our oaths for any price even if he is a near relative, nor will we hide the testimony of Allah – if we do, then surely we are of the sinners.”
Then if it is later known that both of them committed sin, two others may take their place, from those who were caused the most harm by the false testimony, and they must swear by Allah that, “Our testimony is more accurate than the testimony of these two, and we have not exceeded the limits – if we do, then surely we shall be of the unjust.”
This is more suitable than their bearing testimony as they wish or fear that some oaths may be made void, after their taking oath; so fear Allah and heed the commands; and Allah does not guide the disobedient.
On the day when Allah will gather all the Noble Messengers, and then say, “What response did you get?” They will submit, “We do not have any knowledge; indeed it is only You, Who knows all the hidden.”
When Allah will say, “O Eisa, the son of Maryam! Remember My favour upon you and your mother; when I supported you with the Holy Spirit; you were speaking to people from the cradle and in maturity; and when I taught you the Book and wisdom and the Taurat and the Injeel; and when you used to mould a birdlike sculpture from clay, by My command, and blow into it – so it (the living bird) used to fly by My command, and you used to cure him who was born blind and cure the leper, by My command; and when you used to raise up the dead, by My command; and when I restrained the Descendants of Israel against you when you came to them with clear proofs, and the disbelievers among them said, ‘This is nothing but clear magic’.”
“And when I inspired into the hearts of the disciples that, ‘Believe in Me and in My Noble Messenger’; they said, ‘We accept faith, and be witness that we are Muslims.’”
When the disciples said, “O Eisa, the son of Maryam! Will your Lord send down a table spread (with food) for us from heaven?”
They said, “We wish to eat from it and so that our hearts be convinced and to see that you have spoken the truth to us, and that we may be witnesses upon it.”
Eisa, the son of Maryam, said, “O Allah, O our Lord! Send down to us a table spread from heaven, so that it may become a day of celebration for us – for our former and latter people – and a sign from You; and give us sustenance – and You are the Best Provider Of Sustenance.”
Said Allah, “Indeed I shall send it down to you; so thereafter whoever disbelieves amongst you – I will surely mete out to him a punishment with which I shall not punish anyone else in the whole world.”
And when Allah will say, “O Eisa, the son of Maryam! Did you say to the people, ‘Appoint me and my mother as two Gods, besides Allah’?”
He will submit, “Purity is to You!
It is not proper for me to say something for which I do not have a right; if I have said it, then surely You know it; You know what lies in my heart, and I do not know what is in Your knowledge; indeed You only know all the hidden.”
“I have not told them except what You commanded me, that ‘Worship Allah, Who is my Lord and is also your Lord’; I was aware of them till I was among them; and when You raised me, only You watched over them; and all things are present before You.”
“If you punish them, then indeed they are Your slaves; and if you forgive them, then indeed You only are the Almighty, the Wise.”
Proclaimed Allah, “This is a day on which the truthful will benefit from their truthfulness; for them are Gardens beneath which rivers flow, in which they will abide for ever and ever; Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Allah; this is the greatest success.”
To Allah only belongs the kingship of the heavens and the earth and all that is in them: and He is Able to do all things.
All praise is to Allah, Who has created the heavens and the earth, and has created darkness and light; yet the disbelievers appoint equals (false deities) to their Lord!
It is He Who has created you from clay, and then decreed a term for you; and it is a fixed promise before Him, yet you still doubt!
And He is Allah (the God) of the heavens and in the earth; He knows all, your secrets and your disclosures, and He knows your deeds.
And never does a sign come to them from among the signs of Allah, except that they* turn away from it. (* The disbelievers)
So indeed they denied the truth* when it came to them; so now the tidings of the thing they used to mock at, will come to them. (Prophet Mohammed -peace and blessings be upon him, or the Holy Qur’an).
Do they not see how many civilisations We destroyed before them, whom We had established more firmly in the earth than We have established you, and We sent on them abundant rain from the sky, and made the rivers flow beneath them? So we destroyed them because of their sins, and created another civilisation after them.
And had We sent down to you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) something written on paper so that they could feel it with their hands, even then the disbelievers would have said, “This is nothing but clear magic.”
And they said, “Why has not an angel been sent down to him?”
And had We sent down an angel, then the matter would have been finished, and they would not get any respite.
And had we appointed an angel as a Prophet, We would still have made him as a man and would keep them in the same doubt, as they are now in.
And certainly, O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) the Noble Messengers before you have also been mocked at, so those who laughed at them were themselves ruined by their own mocking.
Proclaim, “Travel in the land, and see what sort of fate befell those who denied.”
Say, “To Whom does all whatever is in the heavens and the earth, belong?” Proclaim, “To Allah”; He has made mercy obligatory upon His grace; undoubtedly, He will surely gather you all together on the Day of Resurrection in which there is no doubt; those who put their souls to ruin, do not accept faith.
And to Him only belongs all whatever exists in the night and in the day; and He only is the All Hearing, the All Knowing.
Say, “Shall I choose as a supporter someone other than Allah, Who is the Originator of the heavens and the earth and Who feeds and does not need to eat?”
Say, “I have been ordered to be the first to submit myself (to Him), and O people, do not be of the polytheists.”
Say, “If I disobey my Lord, I then fear the punishment of the Great Day (of Resurrection).”
Indeed Allah’s mercy has been upon him, from whom the punishment has been averted on that Day; and this is the clear success.
And if Allah afflicts you with some misfortune, then there is none who can remove it, except Him; and if He sends you some good fortune, then (know that) He is Able to do all things.
He is the Omnipotent over His bondmen; and He is the Wise, the Aware.
Proclaim (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “Whose testimony is the greatest?”
Say, “Allah is the Witness between me and you; and this Qur’an has been sent down upon me, so I may warn you with it and whomever it may reach; so do you bear witness that there are other Gods along with Allah?”
Say, “I do not bear witness to it”; Say, “He is the only One God and I do not have any relation with whatever you ascribe as partners (to Him).”
The people to whom We gave the Book(s) recognise this Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) as they recognise their own sons; those who put their own souls to ruin, do not accept faith.
And who is more unjust than one who fabricates lies against Allah or denies His signs?
Undoubtedly, the unjust will never succeed.
And on the day when We will resurrect everyone together, then say to the polytheists, “Where are those partners (your false deities) whom you professed?”
Then they had no fabrication except that they said, “By Allah, our Lord, we were never polytheists!”
Observe how they lied against themselves, and how they lost the things they fabricated!
And among them is one who listens to you; and We have put covers upon their hearts so they may not understand it, and deafness in their ears; and (even) if they see all the signs, they will not believe in them; to the extent that when they come to you to debate with you, the disbelievers say, “This is nothing but stories of former people.”
And they stop (others) from it and run away from it; and they ruin none except themselves, and they do not have sense.
And if you see them when they will be placed above hell, they will say, “Alas, if only we might be sent back and not deny the signs of our Lord, and become Muslims!”
In fact it has become clear to them what they used to hide before; and were they to be sent back, they would commit the same which they were forbidden to, and undoubtedly they are liars.
And they said, “There is no other life except our life of this world, and we are not to be raised.”
And if you see when they are placed before their Lord, He will say, “Is this not real (the truth)?
They will say, “Yes – why not, by our Lord!”
He will say, “So now taste the punishment – the recompense of your disbelief.”
Those who denied their meeting with Allah, have indeed failed; to the extent that when the Last Day suddenly came upon them they said, “Woe to us that we failed to believe in it” – and they carry their burdens on their backs; what an evil burden they carry!
The life of this world is nothing except a pastime and sport; and undoubtedly the abode of the Hereafter is better for the pious; so do you not have sense?
We know well that their statement grieves you – so they do not deny you (Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) but in fact the unjust deny the signs of Allah.
And indeed Noble Messengers have been denied before you, so they patiently bore the denial and torture till Our help reached them; and there is none to alter the decisions of Allah; and the news of the Noble Messengers have already reached you.
And if their turning away has grieved you, then if you can, seek a tunnel into the earth or a ladder into the sky to bring a sign for them; and if Allah willed, He could have brought them all together upon guidance, so O listener (followers of this Prophet) do not ever be of the ignorant.
It is only those who hear (with sincere hearts) that accept faith; and Allah will raise these people dead of heart, then towards Him they will be herded.
And they said, “Why has no sign been sent down upon him from his Lord?”
Say, “Indeed Allah is Able to send down a sign”, but most of them are totally ignorant.
And there is not an animal moving in the earth nor a bird flying on its wings, but they are a nation like you; We have left out nothing in this Book – then towards their Lord they will be raised.
And those who deny Our signs are deaf and dumb in realms of darkness; Allah may send astray whomever He wills; and may place on the Straight Path whomever He wills.
Say, “What is your opinion – if the punishment of Allah comes upon you or the Hour arrives, will you call upon anyone (deity) besides Allah; if you are truthful?”
“In fact you will only call upon Him, and if He wills, He may remove that because of which you prayed to Him, and you will forget the partners (you ascribe to Him).”
And We have indeed sent Noble Messengers towards the nations that were before you – We therefore seized them with hardship and adversity so that, in some way, they may humbly plead.
So why did they not humbly plead when Our punishment came to them?
But their hearts were hardened and the devil made all their deeds appear good to them!
So when they forgot the advices made to them, We opened the gates of all things for them; to the extent that when they were rejoicing for what they had received, We seized them suddenly, hence they remained dejected.
The origins of the unjust people were therefore cut off; and all praise is to Allah, Lord Of The Creation.
Say, “What is your opinion – if Allah were to take away your hearing and your sight and seal your hearts, then is there a God besides Allah who could restore it for you?”
Observe how We explain the verses to them, yet they turn away!
Say, “What is your opinion – if the punishment of Allah were to come upon you suddenly or openly (with forewarning), who would be destroyed except the disbelieving people?”
And We did not send Noble Messengers except as Heralds of glad tidings and warnings; so upon those who accept faith and reform themselves, shall be no fear nor shall they grieve.
And those who deny Our signs – the punishment will afflict them for their disobedience.
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “I do not say to you that I possess the treasures of Allah, nor do I say that I gain knowledge of the hidden on my own, nor do I say to you that I am an angel; I only follow what is divinely revealed to me”; say, “Will the blind and the sighted ever be equal?
So do you not think?”
And with this Qur’an warn those who fear, that they will be raised towards their Lord in a state when, except Allah, there will be no protector for them nor an intercessor, so that they may be pious.
And do not repel those who call upon their Lord in the morning and evening, seeking His pleasure; you are not responsible for their account nor are they responsible for your account – then your repelling them would be far from justice.
And similarly We have made some as a trial for others – that the wealthy disbelievers upon seeing the needy Muslims say, “Are these whom Allah has favoured among us?”
Does not Allah recognise those who are thankful?
And when those who believe in Our signs come humbly in your presence, say to them, “Peace be upon you – your Lord has prescribed mercy for Himself by His grace – that whoever among you commits a sin by folly and thereafter repents and reforms (himself), then indeed Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.”
And this is how We explain Our verses clearly and so that the way of the criminals become well exposed.
Say, “I have been forbidden to worship those whom you worship other than Allah”; say, “I do not follow your desires – if it were, I would then go astray and not be on the right path.”
Say, “I am on the clear proof from my Lord, whereas you deny Him; I do not have what you are impatient for; there is no command except that of Allah; He states the truth and He is the Best of Judges."
Say, “If I had the thing for which you are impatient, then the matter between me and you would have already been decided”; and Allah is Well Aware of the unjust.
And it is He Who has the keys of the hidden – only He knows them; and He knows all that is in the land and the sea; and no leaf falls but He knows it – and there is not a grain in the darkness of the earth, nor anything wet or dry, which is not recorded in a clear Book.
And it is He Who removes your souls at night (while asleep) and knows whatever you commit by day; then He raises you again during the day, to complete the term appointed (for you); then it is to Him that you are to return – He will then inform you of what you used to do.
And He is Omnipotent over His bondmen and sends guardians over you; to the extent that when death comes to one of you, Our angels remove his soul, and they do not err.
They (the souls) are then returned towards their True Lord – Allah; pay heed!
Only His is the command; and He is the Swiftest At Taking Account.
Say, “Who rescues you from the calamities of the land and the sea – Whom you call upon crying loudly and in whispers that, ‘If we are saved from this we will surely be grateful’?”
Say, “Allah delivers you from these and from all distresses – yet you ascribe partners to Him!”
Say, “He is Able to send punishment upon you from above you or from beneath your feet, or to cause you to fight each other by dividing you into different groups, and make you taste the harshness of one another”; observe how We explain the verses so that they may understand.
And your people (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) denied it whereas this is undoubtedly the truth; say, “I am not responsible for you.”
All matters have a fixed time and soon you will come to know.
And O listener (followers of this Prophet) when you see those who argue in Our verses, turn away from them until they engage in another topic; and if the devil causes you to forget, then do not sit with the unjust after remembering.
And the pious are not accountable for them in the least, apart from the giving of advice so that they may avoid.
And forsake those who have made their religion a mockery and play, and whom the worldly life has deceived – and advise them with this Qur’an so that a soul may not be seized for what it earns; other than Allah it will not have a protector nor an intercessor; and if it offers every recompense in exchange for itself, it will not be accepted from it; these are the ones who are seized for their own deeds; for them is boiling water to drink and a painful punishment, as a recompense of their disbelief. (The disbelievers will not have any intercessors.)
Say, “Shall we worship, other than Allah, that which neither benefits us nor harms us, and (therefore) be turned back after Allah has guided us, like one whom the devils have led astray in the earth – bewildered?; his companions call him to the path (saying), ‘Come here’”; say, “Indeed only the guidance of Allah is (the true) guidance; and we are commanded to submit to the Lord Of The Creation.”
“And to keep the (obligatory) prayer established and to fear Him; and it is to Him that you are to be raised.”
And it is He Who perfectly created the heavens and the earth; and when He will say “Be” on the Day (of resurrection) to all the extinct things, it will happen immediately; His Word is true; and it will be His kingship on the day when the Trumpet is blown; All Knowing of all the hidden and the revealed; and He only is the Wise, the Aware.
And remember when Ibrahim said to his father (paternal uncle) Azar, “What! You appoint idols as Gods?
Indeed I find you and your people in open error.” (Prophet Ibrahim was rightly guided since birth).
And likewise We showed Ibrahim the entire kingdom of the heavens and the earth and so that he be of those who believe as eyewitnesses.
So when the night became dark upon him he saw a star; he said (to Azar / the people), “(You portray that) this is my Lord?”; then when it set he said, “I do not like the things that set.”
Then when he saw the moon shining, he said, “(You proclaim that) this is my Lord?”; then when it set, he said, “If my Lord had not guided me*, I too would be one of these astray people.” (* Prophet Ibrahim was rightly guided before this event).
Then when he saw the sun shining brightly, he said, “(You say that) this is my Lord?
This is the biggest of them all!”; then when it set he said, “O people! I do not have any relation with the whatever you ascribe as partners (to Him).”
“I have directed my attention towards Him Who has created the heavens and the earth, am devoted solely to Him, and am not of the polytheists.”
And his people argued with him; he said, “What!
You dispute with me concerning Allah?
So He has guided me; and I do not have any fear of whatever you ascribe as partners, except what my Lord wills (to happen); my Lord’s knowledge encompasses all things; so will you not accept advice?”
“And how should I fear whatever you ascribe as partners, whilst you do not fear that you have ascribed partners to Allah – for which He has not sent down on you any proof?
So which of the two groups has more right to refuge, if you know?”
Those who believed and did not mix it with injustice (disbelief), the refuge is only for them, and only they are on guidance.
And this is Our argument, which We gave Ibrahim against his people; We raise to high ranks whomever We will; indeed your Lord is Wise, All Knowing.
And We bestowed upon him Ishaq (Isaac) and Yaqub (Jacob); We guided all of them; and We guided Nooh before them and of his descendants, Dawud and Sulaiman and Ayyub and Yusuf and Moosa and Haroon; and this is the way We reward the virtuous.
And (We guided) Zakaria and Yahya (John) and Eisa and Elias; all these are worthy of Our proximity.
And Ismael (Ishmael) and Yasa’a (Elisha) and Yunus (Jonah) and Lut (Lot); and to each one during their times, We gave excellence over all others.
And some of their ancestors and their descendants and their brothers; and We chose them and guided them to the Straight Path.
This is the guidance of Allah, which He may give to whomever He wills among His bondmen; and had they ascribed partners (to Allah), their deeds would have been wasted.
These are the ones whom We gave the Book and the wisdom and the Prophethood; so if these people do not believe in it, We have then kept ready for it a nation who do not reject (the truth).
These are the ones whom Allah guided, so follow their guidance; say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “I do not ask from you any fee for the Qur’an; it is nothing but an advice to the entire world.”
And they (the Jews) did not realise (or appreciate) the importance of Allah as was required when they said, “Allah has not sent down anything upon any human being”; say, “Who has sent down the Book which Moosa brought, a light and guidance for mankind, which you have divided into different papers, some which you show and hide most of them? And (by which) you are taught what you did not know nor did your forefathers?”
Say, “Allah” – then leave them playing in their indecency.
And this is the blessed Book which We have sent down, confirming the Books preceding it, and in order that you may warn the leader of all villages and all those around it in the entire world; and those who believe in the Hereafter accept faith in this Book, and guard their prayers.
Who is more unjust than one who fabricates lies against Allah or says, “I have received divine inspiration”, whereas he has not been inspired at all – and one who says, “I will now reveal something similar to what Allah has sent down”?
And if you see when the unjust are in the throes of death and the angels are with their hands outstretched; (saying) “Surrender your souls; this day you shall be given a disgraceful punishment – the recompense of your fabricating lies against Allah, and your scorning His signs.”
“And indeed you (the disbelievers) have now come to Us alone as We had created you at first, and you have left behind you all the wealth and riches We had bestowed upon you; and We do not see your intercessors along with you, whom you claimed to possess a share in you; indeed the link between yourselves is cut off, and you have lost all what you contended.”
Indeed it is Allah Who splits the grain and the seed; it is He Who brings forth living from the dead, and it is He Who brings forth dead from the living; such is Allah; so where are you reverting?
It is He Who breaks dawn (by splitting the dark); and He has made the night a calmness, and the sun and the moon a count (for time); this is the command set by the Almighty, the All Knowing.
And it is He Who has created the stars for you, so that you may find your way by them in the darkness of the land and the sea; indeed We have explained Our verses in detail for the people of knowledge.
And it is He Who has created you from a single soul – then you have to stop over* in one place and stay entrusted** in another; indeed We have explained Our verses in detail for people of understanding. (* This earth. ** The grave.)
And it is He Who sends down water from the sky; so with it We produced all things that grow; hence We produce from it vegetation from which We bring forth grains in clusters; and from the pollen of dates, dense bunches – and gardens of grapes and olives and pomegranates, similar in some ways and unlike in some; look at its fruit when it bears yield, and its ripening; indeed in it are signs for the people who believe.
And out of sheer ignorance they have ascribed jinns as partners of Allah, whereas it is He Who created them, and they have invented sons and daughters for Him!
Purity and Supremacy is to Him, from all what they ascribe.
The Originator of the heavens and the earth; how can He possibly have a child when, in fact, He does not have a spouse? And He has created all things; and He knows everything.
Such is Allah, your Lord; and none is worthy of worship except Him; the Creator of all things – therefore worship Him; and He is the Trustee over all things.
Eyes do not encompass Him – and all eyes are within His domain*; He is the Most Subtle, the Fully Aware. (* control / knowledge)
“Enlightening proofs came to you from your Lord; so whoever observes, it is for his own good; and whoever is blind, it is for his own harm; and I am not a guardian over you.”
And this is how We explain Our verses in different ways that they (the disbelievers) may say to you, (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “You have studied” – and to make it clear for the people of knowledge.
Follow what is divinely revealed to you from your Lord; there is none worthy of worship except Him; and turn away from the polytheists.
And if Allah willed, they would not ascribe (any partner to Him); We have not made you as a guardian over them; and you are not responsible for them.
Do not abuse those whom they worship besides Allah lest they become disrespectful towards Allah’s Majesty, through injustice and ignorance; likewise, in the eyes of every nation, We have made their deeds appear good – then towards their Lord they have to return and He will inform them of what they used to do.
And they swore by Allah vehemently in their oaths that if any sign came to them, they will certainly believe in it; say, “The signs are with Allah, and what do you people know that if they came to them, they will not believe.”
And We revert their hearts and their eyes – the way they had not believed the first time – and We leave them to keep wandering blindly in their rebellion.
And had We sent down the angels towards them, and had the dead spoken to them, and had We raised all things in front of them, they would still not have believed unless Allah willed – but most of them are totally ignorant.
And similarly We have appointed enemies for every Prophet – devils from men and jinns – one inspires the other with fabrications to deceive; and had your Lord willed they would not do so, therefore leave them with their fabrications.
And in order that the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter may lean towards it and that they may like it, and earn the sins which they are to earn.
“So shall I seek the command other than that of Allah, whereas it is He Who has sent down the detailed Book towards you?”
And those whom We gave the Book know that this is the truth sent down from your Lord, so O listener, (followers of this Prophet) do not ever be of those who doubt.
And the Word of your Lord is complete in truth and justice; there is none to change His Words; He is the All Hearing, the All Knowing.
And O listener, (followers of the Prophet) most of the people on earth are such that were you to obey them, they would mislead you from Allah’s way; they follow only assumptions and they only make guesses.
Your Lord well knows who has strayed from His way; and He well knows the people on guidance.
So eat from that over which Allah’s name has been mentioned, if you believe in His signs.
And what is the matter with you that you should not eat from that over which Allah’s name has been mentioned whereas He has explained in detail to you all what is forbidden to you except when you are forced (by circumstances) towards it?
And indeed many lead astray by their own desires, out of ignorance; indeed your Lord well knows the transgressors.
And give up the open and hidden sins; those who earn sins will soon receive the punishment of their earnings.
And do not eat that on which Allah’s name has not been mentioned, and indeed that is disobedience; and undoubtedly the devils inspire in the hearts of their friends to fight with you; and if you obey them, you are then polytheists.
And will the one who was dead and so We raised him to life and set for him a light with which he walks among the people, ever be like the one who is in realms of darkness never to emerge from them?
Similarly, the deeds of disbelievers are made to appear good to them.
And similarly, We have made in every town leaders among its criminals that they may conspire in it; and they do not conspire except against themselves and they do not have perception.
And when a sign comes to them, they say, “We will not believe until we are given the same which Allah’s Noble Messengers were given”; Allah knows best where to place His message (prophethood); soon the guilty will be afflicted with disgrace before Allah and a severe punishment due to their scheming.
And whomever Allah wills to guide, He opens his bosom for Islam; and whomever He wills to send astray, He makes his bosom narrow and firmly bound as if he were being forced by someone to climb the skies; this is how Allah places the punishment on those who do not believe.
And this is the Straight Path of your Lord; We have explained in detail Our verses for the people who accept advice.
For them is the abode of peace with their Lord and He is their Master – the result of their deeds.
And the Day when He will raise them all and will proclaim, “O you group of jinns, you have enticed a lot of men”; and their human friends will submit, “Our Lord, some of us have benefited from one another and have reached the appointed term which You had set for us”; He will say, “Your home is hell – remain in it for ever, except whomever Allah wills”; O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), indeed your Lord is the Wise, the All Knowing.
And similarly We empower some of the oppressors over others – the recompense of their deeds.
“O you groups of jinns and men!
Did not the Noble Messengers amongst you come to you reciting My verses and warning you of confronting this day?”
They will say, “We testify against ourselves” – and the worldly life deceived them and they will testify against themselves that they were disbelievers.
This is because your Lord does not unjustly destroy townships for their people may be unaware.
And for everyone are ranks from what they do; and your Lord is not unaware of their deeds.
And O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), your Lord is the Perfect (Not needing anything), the Merciful; O people!
If He wills, He can remove you and bring others in your stead – the way He created you from the descendants of others.
Indeed the thing which you are promised will definitely come to pass, and you cannot escape.
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “O my people!
Keep on with your works* in your positions, I am doing mine; soon you will come to know for whom is the abode of the Hereafter; undoubtedly the unjust are never successful.” (* This is said as a challenge)
And among the crops and animals that Allah has created, they assigned (only) a portion to Him and therefore said “This is for Allah” – in their opinion – “and this is for our partners (false deities)”; so the portion for their partners does not reach Allah; and the portion for Allah reaches their partners; what an evil judgement they impose!
And similarly, their partners (the devils) have made the killing of their children seem righteous in the sight of many of the polytheists, in order to ruin them and make their religion blurred to them; and if Allah willed they would not do so, therefore leave them alone with their fabrications.
And they said, “These cattle and crops are forbidden; only those whom we wish can eat them” – in their opinion – and some cattle are those which they have forbidden riding upon, and some cattle over which they do not mention the name of Allah while slaughtering – all this is fabricating lies against Allah; He will soon repay them for their fabrications.
And they said, “The animals in the bellies of such cattle are purely for our males and forbidden to our women; and if the animal is stillborn, they all have a share of it”; soon Allah will repay them for their utterances; indeed He is Wise, All Knowing.
Indeed ruined are those who slay their children out of senseless ignorance and forbid the sustenance which Allah has bestowed upon them, in order to fabricate lies against Allah; they have undoubtedly gone astray and not attained the path.
It is He Who produces gardens spread on the ground and above, and the date-palm, and crops of various flavours, and the olive and the pomegranate, similar in some respects and unlike in others; eat from its fruit when it bears yield, and pay the due (obligatory charity) from it on the day it is harvested; and do not be wasteful; indeed the wasteful are not liked by Allah.
And from the cattle, some for burdens, some spread on the earth; eat of the sustenance which Allah has bestowed upon you, and do not follow the footsteps of the devil; undoubtedly he is your open enemy.
“Eight males and females; one pair of sheep and one of goats”; say, “Has He forbidden the two males or the two females, or what the two females carry in their wombs?
Answer with some knowledge, if you are truthful.”
“And a pair of camels and a pair of oxen”; say, “Has He forbidden the two males or the two females, or what the two females carry in their wombs?
Were you present when Allah commanded this to you?”
So who is more unjust than one who fabricates a lie against Allah in order to lead mankind astray with his ignorance?
Indeed Allah does not guide the unjust.
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “I do not find in what is sent down to me any eatable prohibited to a consumer, except if it is carrion, or blood flowing from blood vessels, or the flesh of swine – for that is indeed foul, or the sin causing animal over which the name of any other than Allah is taken at the time of slaughtering; so for one compelled by circumstances, neither himself desiring nor eating more than necessary, indeed your Lord is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.”
And for the Jews We forbade all animals with claws; and forbade them the fat of oxen and sheep except which is on their backs or joined to their intestines or to the bone; We awarded this to them for their rebellion; and indeed, surely, We are truthful.
Then if they deny you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) say, “Your Lord has boundless mercy; and His wrath is never withdrawn from the culprits.”
The polytheists will now say, “Had Allah willed, we would not have ascribed partners (to Him) nor would have our forefathers, nor would we have forbidden anything”; similarly those before them had denied, till the time they tasted Our punishment; say, “Do you have any knowledge so you can offer it to us? You follow only assumptions and only make guesses.”
Say, “Then only Allah’s argument is the complete one; so had He willed, He would have guided you all.”
Say, “Bring your witnesses who can testify that Allah has forbidden this”; then if they do testify, O listener (followers of this Prophet) do not bear witness along with them and do not follow the desires of those who deny Our signs, and of those who do not believe in the Hereafter and who ascribed equals to their Lord.
Say, “Come – so that I may recite to you what your Lord has forbidden for you that ‘Do not ascribe any partner to Him and be good to parents; and do not kill your children because of poverty; We shall provide sustenance for all – you and them; and do not approach lewd things, the open among them or concealed; and do not unjustly kill any life which Allah has made sacred; this is the command to you, so that you may have sense.’
‘And do not approach the wealth of an orphan except in the best manner, till he reaches his adulthood; and measure and weigh in full, with justice; We do not burden any soul except within its capacity; and always speak fairly, although it may be concerning your relative; and be faithful only to Allah’s covenant; this is commanded to you, so that you may accept advice.’”
“And that, ‘This is My Straight Path, so follow it; and do not follow other ways for they will sever you from His way; this is commanded to you, so that you may attain piety.’”
Then We gave the Book to Moosa, to complete the favour on one who is virtuous, and an explanation of all things, a guidance and a mercy, so they may believe in meeting their Lord.
And this (the Qur’an) is the blessed Book which We have sent down; so follow it and be pious, so there may be mercy upon you.
For you (the disbelievers) may say, “The Book was sent down only to two groups (Jews and Christians) before us; and we were totally unaware of what they read and taught.”
Or may say that, “If the Book had been sent down to us, we would have been more upon guidance than them”; so the clear proof and guidance and mercy has come to you, from your Lord; so who is more unjust than one who denies the signs of Allah, and turns away from them?
We shall soon punish those who turn away from Our signs with a great punishment, the recompense of their turning away.
What are they waiting for – except that the angels come to them, or the punishment from your Lord, or one of the signs of your Lord?
On the day when the (foretold) sign of your Lord comes, not a single soul who had not earlier accepted faith nor earned any good from its faith, will benefit from accepting faith; say, “Wait – we too are waiting.”
You (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) have no concern with those who divided their religion and became several groups; their case is only with Allah – He will then inform them of what they used to do.
For one who brings one good deed, are ten like it; and one who brings an ill-deed will not be repaid but with one like it, and they will not be wronged.
Say, “Indeed my Lord has guided me to the Straight Path; the right religion, (of) the community of Ibrahim who was free from all falsehood; and was not a polytheist.”
Say, “Undoubtedly my prayers and my sacrifices, and my living and my dying are all for Allah, the Lord Of The Creation.”
“He has no partner; this is what I have been commanded, and I am the first Muslim.”
Say, “Shall I seek a Lord other than Allah, whereas He is Lord of all things?”
And whatever a soul earns is itself responsible for it; and no load bearing soul will bear anyone else’s load; then towards your Lord you have to return and He will inform you about the matters you differed.
And it is He who made you caliphs (viceroys) in the earth and ranked some of you high above others, in order that He may test you with what He has bestowed upon you; indeed it does not take time for your Lord to mete out punishment; and indeed, surely, He is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
Alif-Laam-Meem-Saad. (Alphabets of the Arabic language; Allah and to whomever He reveals, know their precise meanings.)
O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), a Book has been sent down upon you, therefore may not your heart be disinclined towards it, so that you may give warning with it, and as an advice for the Muslims.
O mankind, follow what has been sent down to you from your Lord, and do not follow other administrators, abandoning this (the Holy Qur’an); very little do you understand.
And many a township did We destroy – so Our punishment came to them at night or while they were sleeping at noon.
Therefore they uttered nothing when Our punishment came to them, except that they said, “Indeed we were the unjust.”
So undoubtedly We shall question those to whom Our Noble Messengers went, and indeed We shall question the Noble Messengers.
So indeed We shall inform them with Our knowledge and We were not absent.
And on that Day, the weighing will truly be done; so those whose scales prove heavy are the successful.
And those whose scales are light are the people who put themselves to ruin – the recompense of the injustice they used to do to Our signs.
And indeed We established you in the earth and in it created for you the means of livelihood; very little thanks do you offer!
And indeed We created you, then designed you and then ordered the angels, “Prostrate before Adam”; so they all prostrated, except Iblis (Satan); he did not become of those who prostrate.
Said Allah, “What prevented you, that you did not prostrate when I commanded you?”
Answered Iblis, “I am better than him; You created me from fire whereas You created him from clay.”
Said Allah, “Therefore go down from here – it does not befit you to stay here and be proud – exit, you are of the degraded.”
He said, “Give me respite till the day when people will be resurrected.”
Said Allah, “You are given respite.”
He said, “Hence I swear by the fact that You sent me astray, I will certainly lay in wait for them on Your Straight Path.”
“Then I will certainly approach them – from their front and from behind them and from their right and from their left; and You will find most of them not thankful.”
He said, “Exit from here, rejected, outcast; indeed whoever among them follows your bidding, I will fill hell with all of you.”
And said, “O Adam! You and your wife dwell in Paradise – therefore eat from it from wherever you wish, and do not approach this tree for you will become of those who transgress.”
Then Satan created apprehensions in their hearts in order to disclose to them matters of their shame which were hidden from them, and said, “Your Lord has forbidden you from this tree, for you may become angels or immortals.”
And he swore to them, “Indeed I am a well-wisher for both of you.”
So he brought them down with deception; and when they tasted from that tree, their shame became manifest to them and they began attaching the leaves of Paradise on themselves; and their Lord said to them, “Did I not forbid you from that tree, and tell you that Satan is an open enemy to you?”
They both submitted, “Our Lord! We have wronged ourselves; so if You do not forgive us and have mercy on us, then surely, we are of the losers.”
He said, “Go down, one of you is a foe unto the other; and for a fixed time you shall stay on earth and feed in it.”
He said, “You shall live there and there shall you die, and from there only you will be raised.”
O Descendants of Adam! We have sent down to you a garment to conceal your shame, and another garment for your elegance; and the garment of piety – that is the best; this is among the signs of Allah, so that they may remember.
O Descendants of Adam, beware! Do not let Satan put you in trial the way he removed your parents from Paradise and had their garments removed so that their shame become visible to them; indeed he and his tribe see you from where you do not see them; indeed We have made the devils the friends of those who do not believe.
And when they commit any shameful act they say, “We found our forefathers on it and Allah has commanded it to us”; say, “Indeed Allah does not ordain shamelessness; what!
You attribute things to Allah, which you do not know?”
Say, “My Lord has ordained justice; and set your attention straight every time you offer pray and worship Him, as only His devoted worshippers; the way He brought you into being, in the same manner will you return.”
He has guided one group, and one group’s error has been proved; instead of Allah, they have chosen the devil as their friend and they assume that they are on guidance!
O Descendants of Adam! Adorn yourself when you go to the mosque, and eat and drink, and do not cross limits; indeed He does not like the transgressors.
Say, “Who has forbidden the adornment of Allah which He has brought forth for His bondmen, and the good food?”
Say, “That is for the believers in this world, and on the Day of Resurrection it will be for them only”; this is how We explain Our verses in detail for people of knowledge.
Say, “My Lord has forbidden the indecencies, the apparent among them and the hidden, and sin and wrongful excesses, and forbidden that you ascribe partners with Allah for which He has not sent down any proof, and forbidden that you say things concerning Allah of which you do not have knowledge.”
And every group has a promise; so when its promise comes, it cannot be postponed for a moment or brought forward.
O Descendants of Adam! If Noble Messengers from among you come to you narrating My verses – so whoever practices piety and reforms – upon him shall be no fear nor shall he grieve.
And those who denied Our signs and were conceited towards them, are the people of hell-fire; they will remain in it forever.
So who is more unjust than one who fabricated a lie against Allah or denied His signs?
Their written fate will reach them; until when Our sent angels come to remove their souls, hence they say to them, “Where are they whom you used to worship besides Allah?”
They say, “We have lost them” and they testify against themselves that they were disbelievers.
Allah says to them, “Join the groups of jinns and mankind who have entered hell before you”; when a group enters, it curses the other; until when they have all gone in, the latter groups will say regarding the former, “Our Lord!
It is these who led us astray, so give them double the punishment of the fire”; He will say, “For each one is double – but you do not know.”
And the preceding groups will say to the latter, “So you too were no better than us, therefore taste the punishment for what you have done!”
Indeed those who denied Our signs and were conceited towards them – the gates of the heavens will not be opened for them nor will they enter Paradise until the camel goes through the needle’s eye*; and this is the sort of reward We give the guilty. (* Which will never happen.)
Their beds and their coverings – both are fire; and this is the sort of reward We give the unjust.
And those who accepted faith and performed good deeds according to their capacity – We do not burden any one, except within its capacity – are the people of Paradise; they shall abide in it forever.
And We have removed resentment from their hearts – rivers will flow beneath them; and (while entering Paradise) they will say, “All praise is to Allah, Who guided us to this; we would not have attained the right path if Allah had not guided us; indeed the Noble Messengers of our Lord brought the truth”; and it is proclaimed, “You have received this Paradise as an inheritance for what you used to do.”
And the people of Paradise said to the people of hell, “We have surely received what our Lord had truly promised us – so have you also received what your Lord had truly promised?”
They said, “Yes”; and an announcer between them proclaimed, “The curse of Allah is upon the unjust.” –
“Those who prevent from the path of Allah and wish to distort it; and who disbelieve in the Hereafter.”
Between Paradise and Hell is a veil; and on the Heights will be some men who will recognise them all by their foreheads; and they call to the people of Paradise, “Peace be upon you”; they have not entered Paradise and they yearn for it.
And when their eyes turn towards the people of hell, they will say, “Our Lord! Do not put us along with the unjust.”
And the men on the Heights will call to some men whom they recognise by their foreheads, and say, “What benefit did your derive from your populace and from what you prided in?”
“Are these the people (Muslims) regarding whom you swore that Allah would not have mercy on them at all?
Whereas to the Muslims it has been said ‘Enter Paradise; you shall have no fear nor any grief.’”
And the people of hell will cry out to the people of Paradise, “Provide us some benefit from your water or from the food Allah has provided you”; they will say, “Indeed Allah has forbidden both to the disbelievers.”
People who made their religion a sport and pastime, and whom the worldly life deceived; so this day We will disregard them, the way they had neglected their confronting of this day, and the way they used to deny Our signs.
And indeed We brought to them a Book, which We have explained in detail with a great knowledge – a guidance and a mercy for people who believe.
What do they await, except for the result foretold by that Book to appear?
The day when the result foretold by it occurs, those who had previously forgotten it from the beginning (the disbelievers) will exclaim, “Indeed the Noble Messengers of our Lord had brought the truth!
Do we have any intercessors who may intercede for us?
Or can we be returned (to earth), so we may do contrary to what we have done before?”
Indeed they have put themselves into ruin, and have lost the things they fabricated.
Indeed your Lord is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth in six days, then in the manner befitting His Majesty, ascended the Throne (of control); He covers the night with the day, which hastily follows it, and made the sun and the moon and the stars subservient to His command; pay heed!
Only He has the power to create and command; Most Auspicious (Propitious) is Allah, the Lord Of The Creation.
Pray to your Lord crying humbly, and softly; indeed He does not love the transgressors.
And do not spread turmoil in the earth after its reform, and pray to Him with fear and hope; indeed Allah’s mercy is close to the virtuous.
And it is He Who sends the winds giving glad tidings, ahead of His mercy; until when they come bearing heavy clouds, We drove it towards a city devoid of vegetation, and then rained water upon it, then produced fruits of various kinds from it; this is how We will bring forth the dead, so that you may heed advice.
And from the good land comes forth its vegetation by the command of Allah; and from the infertile land, nothing comes forth except a little with difficulty; this is how We explain Our signs in different ways, for people who are thankful.
Indeed We sent Nooh to his people – he therefore said, “O my people! Worship Allah – you do not have any God except Him; indeed I fear for you the punishment of the Great Day (of Resurrection).”
The leaders of his people said, “Indeed we see you in open error.”
He said, “O my people! There is no straying in me – I am in fact a Noble Messenger from the Lord Of The Creation.”
“Conveying to you the messages of my Lord and wishing good for you, and I know from Allah what you do not know.”
“And are you surprised that an advice came to you from your Lord through a man amongst you, so that he may warn you and that you may fear, and so that there be mercy upon you?”
In response they denied him, so We rescued him and those with him in the ship, and We drowned those who denied Our signs; indeed they were a blind group.
And We sent Hud to the people of Aad from their own community; he said, “O my people!
Worship Allah – you do not have any God except Him; so do you not fear?”
The disbelieving leaders of his people said, “Indeed we consider you foolish and think you are a liar.”
He said, “O my people! I do not have any concern with foolishness and I am in fact a Noble Messenger from the Lord Of The Creation.”
“I convey to you the messages of my Lord and am your trustworthy well-wisher.”
“And are you surprised that an advice came to you from your Lord through a man amongst you, so that he may warn you?
Remember when He made you the successors of Nooh’s people, and enlarged your bodies; therefore remember Allah’s favours, so that you may attain good.”
They said, “Have you come to us in order that we worship only Allah, and abandon those whom our ancestors worshipped?!
So bring upon us what you promise us, if you are truthful.”
He said, “Indeed the punishment and the wrath of your Lord have fallen upon you; what!
You needlessly dispute with me regarding the names you and your ancestors have fabricated?
Allah has not sent down any proof concerning them; therefore wait – I too await with you.”
We therefore rescued him and those with him by a great mercy from Us, and We cut off the lineage of those who denied Our signs – and they were not believers.
And We sent Saleh to the tribe of Thamud, from their own community; he said, “O my people!
Worship Allah – you do not have any God except Him; indeed a clear proof has come to you from your Lord; this is Allah’s she-camel – a sign for you – so leave her free to feed in Allah’s earth, and do not touch her with evil intentions for a painful punishment will seize you.”
“And remember when He made you successors of A’ad and gave you a region in the earth, so you now build palaces in the soft plains and carve houses in rocks; therefore remember Allah’s favours and do not roam the earth spreading turmoil.”
The proud leaders of his people (mockingly) said to the weak Muslims, “Do you know that Saleh is (really) the Noble Messenger of his Lord?”
They said, “We believe in whatever he has been sent with.”
The proud ones said, “We deny what you have believed in.”
So they hamstrung the she-camel and rebelled against the command of their Lord and said, “O Saleh! Bring upon us what you promise us, if you are a Noble Messenger.”
Therefore the earthquake seized them, so at morning they remained lying flattened in their homes.
Indeed I did deliver my Lord’s message to you and wished you good, but you do not want well-wishers.” (The people in the graves can hear the speech of those who are on earth.)
And We sent Lut – when he said to his people, “What! You commit the shameful acts which no one in the creation has ever done before you?”
“You lustfully go towards men, instead of women!
In fact, you have transgressed the limits.”
And his people had no answer except to say, “Turn them out of your dwellings; these are people who wish purity!”
And We rescued him and his family, except his wife – she became of those who stayed behind.
And We rained a shower (of stones) upon them; therefore see what sort of fate befell the culprits!
And We sent Shuaib to Madyan from their community; he said, “O my people! Worship Allah – you do not have any God except Him; indeed a clear proof has come to you from your Lord, so measure and weigh in full and do not give the people their goods diminished, and do not spread turmoil in the earth after it is organised; this is for your good, if you believe.”
“And do not be seated on every road in order to scare the travellers, and to prevent from Allah’s path the people who believe in Him, wishing to distort it; and remember when you were few and He increased your numbers; and see what sort of fate befell the mischievous!”
“And if a group among you believes in what I have been sent with, and another group does not believe, then wait until Allah judges between us; and Allah’s judgement is the best of all.”
The proud leaders of his people said, “O Shuaib, we swear we will banish you and the Muslims who are with you, from our town or you must return to our religion”; he said, “Even though we detest it?”
“We shall then have fabricated a lie against Allah if we return to your religion after Allah has rescued us from it; and it is not for any of us Muslims to return to your religion except if Allah, Who is our Lord, wills; the knowledge of our Lord encompasses all things; in Allah only we have trusted; our Lord! Decide with justice between us and our people – and Yours is the best decision.”
And the disbelieving leaders of his people said, “If you obey Shuaib, you will indeed be in a loss.”
Therefore the earthquake seized them – so at morning they remained lying flattened in their homes.
As if those who denied Shoaib had never lived in those homes; those who denied Shoaib, were themselves ruined.
So Shoaib turned away from them saying, “O my people! Indeed I did deliver my Lord’s message to you and gave you sound advice; so why should I grieve for the disbelievers?”
(The people in the graves can hear the speech of those who are on earth.)
And never did We send any Prophet to a dwelling but We seized its people with hardship and adversity so that they may become humble.
Then We changed the misfortune into prosperity to the extent that they became numerous and said, “Indeed grief and comfort did reach our ancestors” – so We seized them suddenly in their neglect.
And had the people of the dwellings believed and been pious, We would have surely opened for them the blessings from the sky and from the earth, but in fact they denied, and We therefore seized them on account of their deeds.
Do the people of the dwellings not fear that Our wrath may come upon them at night while they are asleep?
Or do the people of the dwellings not fear that Our wrath may come upon them during the day, while they are playing?
Are they oblivious to Allah’s secret plan?
So none is unafraid of Allah’s secret plan except the people of ruin!
Or did not those who inherited the land after its owners, get enough guidance that if We will, We can afflict them with calamity for their sins? And We set seals upon their hearts so they do not hear.
These are the dwellings – the affairs of which We relate to you (Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him); and indeed their (respective) Noble Messengers came to them with clear proofs; so they were not able to believe in what they had denied before; this is how Allah sets seals upon the hearts of disbelievers.
And We found most of them not true to their words; and indeed We found most of them disobedient.
Then after them, We sent Moosa with our signs to Firaun and his court members, but they did injustice to those signs; therefore see what sort of fate befell the mischievous!
And Moosa said, “O Firaun! Indeed I am a Noble Messenger from the Lord Of The Creation.”
“It is obligatory for me not to speak concerning Allah except the truth; I have come to you all with a clear sign from your Lord, therefore let the Descendants of Israel go with me.”
Said Firaun, “If you have come with a sign, then present it if you are truthful!”
Therefore Moosa put down his staff – it immediately turned into a visible python.
And putting his hand in his bosom, withdrew it – so it shone brightly before the beholders.
Said the chieftains of Firaun’s people, “He is really an expert magician.”
“He wishes to expel you all from your kingdom; so what do you advise?”
They said, “Stop him and his brother, and send announcers to the cities to gather people.”
“To bring all the expert magicians to you.”
And the magicians came to Firaun, and said, “Will we get some reward if we are victorious?”
He said, “Yes, and you will then become close to me.”
They said, “O Moosa! You may throw first – or shall we be the first to throw?”
He said, “You throw”; when they threw, they cast a magic spell upon the people’s eyes and terrified them, and they brought a great magic.
And We inspired Moosa that, “Put forth your staff”; it immediately began swallowing up their fabrications.
So the truth was proved and their works were disproved.
They were therefore defeated here and they turned back humiliated.
And the magicians were obliged to fall prostrate.
They said, “We have accepted faith in the Lord Of The Creation.”
“The Lord of Moosa and Haroon.”
Said Firaun, “You have accepted faith in Him before I gave you permission!
This is indeed a grand conspiracy you have plotted in the city, in order to expel its people from it; so now you will come to know!”
“I swear I will cut off your hands and your feet from alternate sides and then crucify you all.”
They said, “We shall return to our Lord.”
“And what did you dislike in us, except that we believed in the signs of our Lord when they came to us? Our Lord!
Pour (bestow abundantly) patience on us, and bestow us death as Muslims.”
The chieftains of Firaun’s people said, “Are you releasing Moosa and his people to cause turmoil in the land, and for Moosa to abandon you and your appointed deities?” He said, “We shall now slay their sons and spare their women; and indeed we have power over them.”
Moosa said to his people, “Seek the help of Allah and patiently endure; indeed the Owner of the earth is Allah – He appoints as its successor whomever He wills; and the final triumph is for the pious.”
They said, “We have been oppressed before you came to us, and after you have come to us”; he said, “It is likely that your Lord may destroy your enemy and in his place make you the rulers of the earth, and then see what deeds you perform.”
And indeed We seized the people of Firaun with a famine of several years and with reduction of fruits, so that they may follow advice.
So when good would reach them they would say, “This is for us”; and when misfortune reached them, they would infer it as ill omens of Moosa and his companions; pay heed!
The misfortune of their ill luck lies with Allah, but most of them are unaware.
And said, “You may come with any sign to us, in order to cast a magic spell on us – yet by no means are we going to believe in you.”
We therefore sent against them the flood and the locusts and the vermin (or insects) and the frogs and the blood – separate signs; in response they were proud and were a guilty people.
And whenever the punishment came upon them they said, “O Moosa! Pray to your Lord for us, by means of His covenant which you have; indeed if you lift the punishment from us we will surely accept faith in you and let the Descendants of Israel go with you.”
Consequently whenever We lifted the punishment from them for a term which they must reach, they used to then turn away.
We therefore took revenge from them; so We drowned them in the sea for they used to deny Our signs and were ignoring them.
And We made the people who were oppressed, the inheritors of the eastern and western parts of the land in which We placed blessings; and the good promise of your Lord was fulfilled for the Descendants of Israel – the reward of their patience; and We destroyed whatever Firaun and his people built and whatever they had contrived.
And We transported the Descendants of Israel across the sea – so they came across a people who used to squat in seclusion in front of their idols; they said, “O Moosa!
Make a God for us, the way they have so many Gods!”
He said, “You are indeed an ignorant people.”
“The condition they are in is, in fact, one of destruction – and all what they do is utter falsehood.”
He said, “Shall I seek for you a God other than Allah, whereas He has given you superiority above the entire world?” (By sending His message towards you).
And remember when We rescued you from Firaun’s people who were afflicting you with a dreadful torment; slaughtering your sons and sparing your daughters; and in it was a great favour from your Lord.
And We agreed with Moosa a covenant for thirty nights (of solitude) and completed it by adding ten to them, so the covenant of His Lord amounted to forty nights in full; and Moosa said to his brother Haroon, “Be my deputy over my people and make reform and do not allow the ways of the mischievous to enter.”
And when Moosa presented himself upon Our promise, and his Lord spoke to him, he said, “My Lord!
Show me Your Self, so that I may see You”; He said, “You will never be able to see Me, but look towards the mountain – if it stays in its place, then you shall soon see Me”; so when his Lord directed His light on the mountain, He blew it into bits and Moosa fell down unconscious; then upon regaining consciousness he said, “Purity is to You!
I incline towards You, and I am the first Muslim.”
Said Allah, “O Moosa! I have chosen you from mankind by (bestowing) My messages and by My speech; so accept what I have bestowed upon you and be among the thankful.”
And We wrote for him on the tablets, the advice for all things and the details of all things; and commanded “Accept it firmly and command your people to choose its good advices; soon I shall show you people the destination of the disobedient.”
“And I shall turn away from My signs the people who unjustly wish to be admired in the earth; and if they see all the signs, they would not believe them; and if they see the path of guidance, they would not prefer to tread it; and if they see the way of error, they would present themselves to tread it; that is because they denied Our signs and were ignoring them.
And those who denied Our signs and the confronting of the Hereafter – all their deeds are wasted; what recompense will they get, except what they used to do?
And behind Moosa, his people moulded a calf from their ornaments – a lifeless body making sounds like a cow; did they not see that it neither speaks to them nor guides them in any way?
They chose it (for worship), and were unjust.
And when they repented and realised that they had gone astray, they said, “If our Lord does not have mercy on us and forgive us, we are ruined.”
And when Moosa returned to his people, angry and upset, he said, “What an evil way you have handled affairs on my behalf, behind me; did you hasten upon the command of your Lord?”
And he cast down the stone tablets, and catching hold of his brothers hair, began pulling him towards him; said Haroon said, “O the son of my mother!
The people thought I was weak and would have probably killed me; so do not make my enemies laugh at me and do not identify me with the unjust.”
He submitted, “My Lord! Forgive me and my brother and admit us into Your mercy; and You are the Most Merciful of all those who show mercy.”
Indeed those who took the calf – the punishment from their Lord, and humiliation will reach them in the life of this world; and this is the way We reward those who fabricate lies.
And those who performed misdeeds and then repented and accepted faith – so after that, your Lord is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
And when the anger of Moosa abated, he picked up the stone tablets; and in their texts are guidance and mercy for those who fear their Lord.
And Moosa chose seventy men from his people for Our promise; therefore when the earthquake seized them, he submitted, “My Lord!
If You had willed You could have destroyed them and me, even earlier!
Will You destroy us for the deeds which the ignorant among us did?
That is not but Your testing us; with it You send astray whomever You will and guide whomever You will; You are our Master, so forgive us and have mercy on us, and You are the Best of the Forgiving.”
“And destine good for us in this world and in the Hereafter – We have indeed inclined towards You”; He said, “I give My punishment to whomever I will; and My mercy encompasses all things; so I shall soon destine favours for those who fear and pay the charity, and they believe in Our signs.”
“Those who will obey this Noble Messenger (Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), the Herald of the Hidden who is untutored* (except by Allah), whom they will find mentioned in the Taurat and the Injeel with them; he will command them to do good and forbid them from wrong, and he will make lawful for them the good clean things and prohibit the foul for them, and he will unburden the loads and the neck chains which were upon them; so those who believe in him, and revere** him, and help him, and follow the light which came down with him – it is they who have succeeded." (*The Holy Prophet was taught by Allah Himself – see Surah 55 Al-Rahman. **To honour the Holy Prophet – peace and blessings be upon him – is part of faith. To disrespect him is blasphemy.)
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “O people!
Indeed I am, towards you all, the Noble Messenger of Allah – for Whom (Allah) only is the kingship of the heavens and the earth; there is none worthy of worship, except Him – giving life and giving death; therefore believe in Allah and His Noble Messenger, the Prophet who is untutored (except by Allah), who believes in Allah and His Words, and obey him (the Prophet) to attain guidance.” (Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him – is the Prophet towards all mankind.)
And among the people of Moosa is a group that shows the true path, and establishes justice with it.
And We divided them into twelve tribes, as separate groups; and when his people asked him for water, We revealed to Moosa, “Strike the rock with your staff”; so twelve springs gushed forth from it; each group recognised its drinking-place; and We made the clouds a canopy over them and sent down the Manna and the Salwa (birds) on them; “Eat of the good things we have provided you”; and they did not wrong Us in the least, but they used to wrong themselves.
And remember when they were commanded, “Reside in this township and eat whatever you wish in it, and say ‘Sins are forgiven’ and enter the gate prostrating – We will forgive you your sins; We shall soon bestow more upon the virtuous.”
So the unjust among them changed the words, contrary to what they had been commanded – consequently We sent down upon them a punishment from the sky – the recompense of their injustice.
And ask them (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) of the township that was by the sea; when they used to exceed in the matter of the Sabbath – when their fish used to come swimming atop the water in front of them on the day of Sabbath and not come on the days it was not Sabbath; this is how We used to test them, due to their disobedience.
And when a group among them said, “Why do you preach to a people whom Allah is going to destroy or mete out a severe punishment?” They said, “To have an excuse before your Lord, and that perhaps they may fear.”
And when they forgot the advices they had been given, We rescued those who forbade evil, and seized the unjust with a dreadful punishment – the recompense of their disobedience.
Consequently when they rebelled against the command to refrain, We said to them, “Be apes, despised!”
And remember when your Lord announced the command that till the Day of Resurrection I will certainly send such oppressors against them, who will inflict them with a dreadful punishment; indeed your Lord is swift in meting out punishment; and indeed He is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
And We divided them in the earth as separate groups; some of them are righteous and some are the other type; and We tested them with good (favours) and evil things (adversities) so that they may return.
And after them in their place, came those unworthy successors who inherited the Books – they accept the goods of this world (as bribes) and say, “We shall soon be forgiven”; and if similar goods come to them again, they would accept it; was not the covenant taken from them in the Book, that they must not relate anything to Allah except the truth, and they have studied it? And indeed the abode of the Hereafter is better for the pious; so do you not have sense?
And those who hold fast to the Book, and have kept the prayer established; and We do not waste the wages of the righteous.
And when We raised the Mount (Sinai) above them as if it were a canopy, and they thought that it would fall upon them; “Accept firmly what We have given you, and remember what is in it, so that you may become pious.”
And remember when your Lord brought forth the generations from the backs of the Descendants of Adam, and made them their own witness; “Am I not your Lord?”; they all said, “Yes surely You are, why not?
We testify”; for you may say on the Day of Resurrection that, “We were unaware of this.”
Or you may say, “It is our ancestors who first ascribed partners (to Allah) and we were (their) children after them; so will You destroy us on account of the deeds of the followers of falsehood?”
And this is how We explain the verses in different ways, and so that they may return.
And O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) recite to them the case of the one to whom We gave Our revelations, and in response he departed from them completely – so Satan went after him – he therefore became of the astray.
And had We willed We could have raised him because of the revelations, but he clung to the earth and followed his own desires; his condition therefore is like that of a dog; if you attack him he hangs out his tongue and if you leave him he hangs out his tongue; this is the state of the people who denied Our signs; therefore preach, so that they may give thought.
What an evil example is of those who denied Our signs and used to wrong only their own souls.
Whomever Allah guides – only he is on the right path; and whomever He sends astray – it is they who are the losers.
And indeed We have created many jinns and men for hell; they have hearts in which their is no understanding; and the eyes they do not see with; and the ears they do not hear with; they are like cattle – in fact more astray; it is they who are the neglectful.
And for Allah only are the best names, so invoke Him by them; and abandon those who depart from the truth regarding His names; they will soon receive the reward of their deeds.
And from Our creation is a group that shows the truth and establishes justice with it.
And those who denied Our signs – We shall soon steadily lead them towards the punishment, from the place they will not know.
And I will give them respite; indeed My secret plan is extremely solid.
Do they not ponder that their companion is far removed from insanity?
In fact he is clearly a Herald of Warning.
Have they not pondered deeply regarding the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and whatever things Allah created? And that possibly their promise (of death) may have come near?
So after this*, in what will they believe? (*Advent of the Last Prophet and the Holy Qur’an.)
For one whom Allah sends astray, there is none to guide him; and He leaves them to wander in their rebellion.
They ask you about the Resurrection, as to when it is destined; say, “Indeed its knowledge is with my Lord; only He will manifest it at its time; it is proving cumbersome in the heavens and the earth; it will not come to you except suddenly”; they question you as if you have researched it deeply; say, “Indeed its knowledge is with Allah only but most people do not know.”
Say, “I have no autonomy to benefit or hurt myself, except what Allah wills; and were I to procure knowledge of the hidden on my own, it would be that I had accumulated a lot of good; and no misfortune would touch me; I am purely a Herald of Warning and Glad Tidings to the people who believe.”
It is He Who created you from a single soul, and from him made its mate for him to gain comfort with her; so when the male covered her, she was burdened lightly in her womb, and she therefore moved easily carrying it; and when she felt the burden heavy, they both cried to their Lord Allah, “Indeed You may give to us a child as You will, so we will surely be thankful.”
So when He bestowed them a normal child, they ascribed partners (to Him) in respect of what He had bestowed upon them; therefore Supreme is Allah, above all that they ascribe as partners.
Do they (the disbelievers) ascribe (false deities) that which do not create anything, but are themselves created?
And cannot provide any help to them, nor do they help themselves?
And if you call the disbelievers to guidance, they do not follow you; it is the same for you, whether you invite them or remain silent.
Indeed those whom you (the disbelievers) worship besides Allah are slaves like you – so call them and they may answer you, if you are truthful!
Do they have feet to walk with? Or have they hands to hold with?
Or have they ears to hear with? Say, “Call upon your ascribed partners and conspire against me, and do not give me respite.”
“Indeed my Protector is Allah Who has sent down the Book; and He befriends the righteous.”
“And those whom you worship besides Him cannot help you nor do they help themselves.”
And if you call them to guidance they do not listen; and you (Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) observe them looking towards you, whereas they do not perceive anything.
And O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) adopt forgiveness, and enjoin virtue, and turn away from the ignorant.
And O listener! If the devil provokes you, seek the refuge of Allah; indeed He is All Hearing, All Knowing.
Indeed those who fear get alerted whenever a temptation from the devil troubles them, and they perceive immediately.
And the devils pull those who their brothers into error, and then do not make any relaxation.
And O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) when you do not bring to them a verse, they say, “Why did you not fabricate it?”
Say, “I follow only what is divinely revealed to me from my Lord”; this (the Holy Qur’an) is an enlightenment from your Lord, and a guidance and a mercy for the Muslims.
And when the Qur’an is recited, listen to it attentively and keep silent, so that you receive mercy.
And remember your Lord within your hearts humbly and with fear, and softly with your tongues, morning and evening, and do not be of the neglectful.
Indeed those who are with your Lord are not conceited towards worshipping Him, and they proclaim His Purity and it is to Him they prostrate. (Command of Prostration # 1)
They ask you O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) concerning the war booty; say, “Allah and the Noble Messenger are the owners of the war booty; so fear Allah and maintain friendship among yourselves; and obey Allah and His Noble Messenger, if you have faith."
Only they are the believers whose hearts fear when Allah is remembered, and their faith advances when His verses are recited to them, and who trust only in their Lord.
Those who keep the prayer established and spend in Our cause from what We have bestowed upon them.
These are the true Muslims; for them are ranks before their Lord, and forgiveness and an honourable sustenance.
The way your Lord caused you, O dear Prophet to come forth from your home with the truth; and indeed a group of Muslims were unhappy about it.
Disputing with you regarding the truth after it had been made clear, as if they were being herded towards a visible death.
And remember when Allah promised you that one of the two groups (of enemies) is for you, and you wished to get the one that posed no danger, and Allah willed to prove the truth with His Words, and to cut the origins of the disbelievers.
In order that He may prove the truth and disprove falsehood, even if the criminals get annoyed.
When you (Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) were seeking the help of your Lord, so He answered your prayers that, “I will help you with a row of thousands of angels.”
And Allah did this just for your happiness and for your hearts to gain contentment; and help does not come except from Allah; indeed Allah is Almighty, Wise.
When He made the slumber overcome you, so it was as a peacefulness from Him, and sent down water from the sky upon you to purify you with it, and to remove the impurity of Satan from you, and to give your hearts fortitude and firmly establish your feet with it.
And when O dear Prophet, your Lord was inspiring the angels that, “I am with you – so make the believers stand firm; I will soon instil fear into the hearts of the disbelievers, so strike above the disbelievers’ necks and hit their each and every bone joint.”
This is because they opposed Allah and His Noble Messenger; and whoever opposes Allah and His Noble Messenger – then indeed Allah’s punishment is severe.
Therefore taste this for now, and along with it for the disbelievers is the punishment of fire.
O People who Believe! When you confront a large army of disbelievers in battle, do not turn your backs to them.
And on that day whoever turns his back to them, except for a battle strategy or to join one’s own company, has then turned towards Allah’s wrath, and his destination is hell; and what an evil place of return!
So you did not slay them, but in fact Allah slew them; and O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) you did not throw (the sand) when you did throw, but in fact Allah threw; and in order to bestow an excellent reward upon the Muslims; indeed Allah is the All Hearing, the All Knowing.
Therefore take this, and (know that) Allah will weaken the scheme of the disbelievers.
O disbelievers! If you seek a judgement, then this judgement has come to you; and if you desist, it is better for you; and if you return to mischief, We will punish you again; and your populace will not benefit you, however large it may be – and besides this, Allah is with the Muslims.
O People who Believe! Obey Allah and His Noble Messenger, and do not turn away from him after you have heard him speak.
And do not be like those who said, “We have heard”, whereas they do not hear.
Indeed the worst beasts in the sight of Allah are those (people) who are deaf, dumb – who do not have any sense.
And had Allah found any goodness in them, He would have made them hear; and had He made them hear they would, in the end, have turned away and gone back.
O People who Believe! Present yourselves upon the command of Allah and His Noble Messenger, when the Noble Messenger calls you towards the matter that will bestow you life; and know that the command of Allah becomes a barrier between a man and his heart’s intentions, and that you will all be raised towards Him.
And fear the turmoil which will certainly not fall only upon a few selected unjust people among you; and know that Allah’s punishment is severe.
And remember when you were only a few and meek in the land, and feared that men may snatch you away – He therefore gave you refuge and strengthened you with His help, and gave you good things as sustenance, so that you may be thankful.
O People who Believe! Do not betray Allah and His Noble Messenger, nor purposely defraud your trusts.
And know that your wealth and your children are a test, and that with Allah is an immense reward.
O People who Believe! If you fear Allah, He will bestow upon you (the criterion) that with which you will separate the truth from falsehood, and He will unburden your misdeeds and forgive you; and Allah is the Extremely Munificent.
And remember O dear Prophet when the disbelievers were scheming against you to either imprison you, or to kill you or to banish you; and they were scheming, and Allah was making His secret plan; and Allah’s secret plan is the best.
And when Our verses are recited to them they say, “Yes, we have heard – if we wanted we could also say something like this – these are nothing but stories of former people!”
And when they said, “O Allah! If this (the Qur’an) is really the truth from You, then shower upon us a rain of stones from the sky, or bring upon us some painful punishment.”
And it is not for Allah to punish them while you O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) are amongst them; and Allah will not punish them as long as they are seeking forgiveness. (Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him – is a mercy unto mankind.)
And what is with them that Allah should not punish them, whereas in fact they prevent from the Sacred Mosque and they are not worthy (of being the custodians) of it; only the pious are its befitting custodians, but most of them do not have knowledge.
And their prayer near the Kaa’bah is nothing except whistling and clapping; “So now taste the punishment – the result of your disbelief.”
Indeed the disbelievers spend their wealth in order to prevent people from the way of Allah; so they will spend it now, and then regret over it, then they will be defeated; and the disbelievers will be gathered towards hell.
In order that Allah may separate the filthy from the pure, and placing the filthy atop one another, make a heap and throw them into hell; it is they who are the losers.
Say to the disbelievers that if they desist, what has passed will be forgiven to them; and if they do the same, the tradition of former people has already passed.
And fight them until no mischief remains and the entire religion is only for Allah; then if they desist, Allah sees all what they do.
And if they turn away, then know that Allah is your Master; so what an Excellent Master and what an Excellent Supporter!
And know that whatever you take as war booty, a fifth of that belongs to Allah and His Noble Messenger, and to relatives, and orphans, and the needy, and the traveller – if you have accepted faith in Allah and what We sent down to Our bondman on the decisive day – the day when two armies had met; and Allah is Able to do all things.
When you were on the near bank and the disbelievers on the far bank, and the caravan below you; and had you made an agreement between one another, you would have failed to reach on the appointed time – but this is in order that Allah may complete a thing that must be done – that he who dies may die by a clear proof and he who lives may live by a clear proof; and indeed Allah is surely, All Hearing, All Knowing.
When O dear Prophet, Allah used to show the disbelievers in your dream as only a few*; and O Muslims, had He shown them to you as many, you would have certainly lost courage and disputed over the affair, but Allah rescued (you); indeed He knows what lies within the hearts. (* They numbered more but their actual strength was equal to only a few.)
And when at the time of fighting He made the disbelievers seem few to you, and you as few in their sight, in order for Allah to conclude the matter that must be done; and towards Allah is the return of all matters.
O People who Believe! When you meet an army, hold firm and remember Allah profusely, in order that you succeed.
And obey Allah and His Noble Messenger, and do not dispute with one another for you will lose courage again and your strength will be lost, and patiently endure; indeed Allah is with those who patiently endure.
And do not be like those who came out from their houses proudly, and to be seen by men, and they prevent people from Allah’s way; and all their actions are within Allah’s control.
And when Satan made their deeds seem good in their sight and said, “This day no one can overpower you, and you are under my protection”; so when the two armies came face to face, he scrambled back and said, “I am unconcerned with you – I can see what is not visible to you – I fear Allah”; and Allah’s punishment is severe.
When the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease were saying, “These Muslims are proud of their religion”; and whoever trusts Allah, then indeed Allah is Almighty, Wise.
And if you see the angels when they are removing the souls of the disbelievers, hitting them on their faces and their backs; “Taste more of the punishment of the fire!” (Punishment in the grave is proven by this verse.)
“This is the recompense of what your own hands have sent ahead, and Allah does not oppress His bondmen.”
Like the ways of Firaun’s people, and those before them; they disbelieved in the signs of Allah – therefore Allah seized them on account of their sins; indeed Allah is Most Powerful, Severe in Punishing.
This is because Allah does not change the favour He has bestowed upon any people until they first change themselves, and indeed Allah is All Hearing, All Knowing.
Like the ways of Firaun’s people and those before them; they denied the signs of Allah – We therefore destroyed them on account of their sins and We drowned the people of Firaun; and they all were unjust.
Indeed the worst beasts in the sight of Allah are the people who disbelieve and do not accept faith.
Those with whom you made a treaty, then they break their agreement each time and do not fear.
So if you find them in battle, kill them in a manner which makes those behind them scamper back, in the hope that they may learn a lesson.
And if you apprehend treachery from a nation, then throw back their treaty towards them in reciprocity; indeed Allah does not like the treacherous.
And never may the disbelievers pride that they have escaped; indeed they can never defeat.
And keep ready for them the maximum of forces you can and the maximum number of horses you can keep tethered, in order to instil awe in the hearts of those who are the enemies of Allah and who are your enemies, and in the hearts of some others whom you do not know; Allah knows them; and whatever you spend in Allah's cause will be repaid to you in full and you will never be in a loss.
And if they incline towards peace, you too lean towards it, and trust Allah; indeed He only is the All Hearing, the All Knowing.
And if they wish to deceive you, then indeed Allah is Sufficient for you; it is He Who has given you strength, with His help and with the Muslims.
And has created harmony among their hearts; if you had spent all that is in the earth you could not have created harmony among their hearts, but Allah has created harmony among them; indeed He only is Almighty, Wise.
O Herald of the Hidden! Allah is Sufficient for you and for all these Muslims who follow you.
O Herald of the Hidden!
Urge the believers to fight; if there are twenty persevering men among you, they shall overcome two hundred; and if there are a hundred among you, they shall overcome a thousand disbelievers because the disbelievers are a people who do not have sense.
So now Allah has made an ease upon you and He knows that you are weak; so if there are a hundred persevering men among you, they shall overcome two hundred; and if there are a thousand among you, they shall overcome two thousand by the command of Allah; and Allah is with those who patiently endure.
It does not befit any Prophet to capture the disbelievers alive until he has profusely shed their blood in the land; you people desire the wealth of this world; and Allah wills the Hereafter, and Allah is Almighty, Wise.
Had Allah not pre-destined a matter then, O Muslims, a terrible punishment would have come upon you due to the ransom you took from the disbelievers.
Therefore benefit from the booty you have received, lawful and good; and keep fearing Allah; indeed Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
O Herald of the Hidden! Say to the captives whom you possess, “If Allah finds any goodness in your hearts, He will give you better than what has been taken from you, and will forgive you; and Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.”
And if they wish to deceive you, they have already been disloyal to Allah, because of which He has given these disbelievers in your control; and Allah is All Knowing, Wise.
Indeed those who accepted faith and left their homes and belongings for Allah, and fought with their wealth and their lives in Allah's cause, and those who gave shelter and provided help, are the heirs of one another; and those who believed but did not leave their homes – you have no right in their estates until they migrate; and if they seek help from you in the matter of religion then it is your duty to provide help, except against the people between whom and you is a treaty; and Allah sees your deeds.
And the disbelievers are the heirs of one another – if you do not do so, there will be turmoil in the land and a great chaos.
And those who believed and migrated and fought in Allah's cause, and those who gave shelter and provided help – it is they who are the true believers; for them is pardon, and an honourable sustenance.
And those who afterwards believed and migrated and fought along with you – they too are from among you; and family members (blood relations) are nearer to one another in the Book of Allah; indeed Allah knows everything.
Severance of ties is proclaimed by Allah and on behalf of His Noble Messenger, towards the polytheists with whom you had a treaty.
Travel freely in the land for four months, and bear in mind that you cannot escape from Allah, and that Allah will humiliate the disbelievers.
And proclaim from Allah and His Noble Messenger to all men on the day of the Great Pilgrimage (Haj) that Allah is disgusted with the polytheists, and so is His Noble Messenger; so if you repent it is better for you; but if you turn away, then know that you cannot escape from Allah; and give the disbelievers the glad tidings of a painful punishment.
Other than those polytheists with whom you had a treaty, and they have not diminished anything from your treaty nor supported anyone against you – therefore fulfil their treaty up to the appointed term; indeed Allah befriends the pious.
Then when the sacred months have passed, slay the polytheists wherever you find them, and catch them and make them captive, and wait in ambush for them at every place; then if they repent and keep the prayer established and pay the charity, leave their way free; indeed Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
And O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), if a polytheist seeks your protection, give him protection so that he may hear the Word of Allah, and then transport him to his place of safety; this is because they are an unwise people.
How can there be a treaty with Allah and with His Noble Messenger for the polytheists, except for those with whom you made a treaty near the Sacred Mosque?
So as long as they remain firm on the treaty for you, you too remain firm for them; indeed Allah is pleased with the pious.
Therefore how – when they are such that if they gain control over you, they would not have regard for any relations nor for any treaty?
They please you with their mouths whereas their hearts contain rejection; and most of them are disobedient.
They exchanged the verses of Allah for an abject price, therefore prevented from His way; indeed what they do is extremely evil.
In respect of the Muslims, they do not keep regard for any relations nor any pacts; it is they who are the rebels.
Then if they repent and keep the prayer established and pay the charity, they are your brothers in religion; and we explain Our verses in detail for the people of knowledge.
And if they break their promises after making a treaty and malign your religion, then fight the leaders of disbelief – indeed their promises are nothing – in the hope that they may desist.
Will you not fight the people who broke their promises, and intended to expel the Noble Messenger whereas they had started it?
Do you fear them?
So Allah has more right that you should fear Him, if you have faith.
So fight them – Allah will punish them at your hands, and He will disgrace them and assist you over them, and He will soothe the hearts of the believers.
And He will remove the anxiety of their hearts; and Allah may accept the repentance of whomever He wills; and Allah is All Knowing, Wise.
Are you under the illusion that you would be left just like this, whereas Allah has not yet made known those of you who will fight and not confide their secrets with anyone except Allah and His Noble Messenger and the Muslims?
And Allah is Well Aware of your deeds.
It does not befit the polytheists to assemble in Allah’s mosques after themselves bearing witness of their disbelief; in fact all their deeds are wasted; and they will remain in the fire forever.
Only those enliven the mosques of Allah who believe in Allah and the Last Day and establish prayer and pay the obligatory charity and fear none except Allah – so it is likely that they will be among the people of guidance.
So have they taken the quenching of the pilgrims’ thirst and servicing of the Sacred Mosque as equal (in merit) to him who accepted faith in Allah and the Last Day, and fought in Allah’s way?
They are not equal before Allah; and Allah does not guide the unjust.
Those who accepted faith, and left their homes and fought with their wealth and their lives in Allah’s way have a greater rank before Allah; and it is they who have succeeded.
Their Lord gives them the glad tidings of His mercy and His pleasure, and the Gardens in which are everlasting favours for them.
They will abide in it for ever and ever; indeed with Allah is the great reward.
O People who Believe! Do not consider your fathers and your brothers as your friends if they prefer disbelief over faith; and whoever among you befriends them – then it is he who is the unjust.
Say, “If your fathers, and your sons, and your brothers, and your wives, and your tribe, and your acquired wealth, and the trade in which you fear a loss, and the houses of your liking – if all these are dearer to you than Allah and His Noble Messenger and fighting in His way, then wait until Allah brings about His command; and Allah does not guide the sinful.”
Indeed Allah helped you on many occasions – and on the day of Huneyn – when you prided in your multitude, so it did not benefit you at all, and the earth despite being vast became restricted for you – then you turned back and returned.
Then Allah sent down His calm upon His Noble Messenger and upon the Muslims, and sent down armies you did not see, and punished the disbelievers; and such is the reward of the deniers.
Then afterwards Allah will give repentance to whomever He wills; and Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
O People who Believe! The polytheists are utterly filthy*; so after this year do not let them come near the Sacred Mosque; and if you fear poverty**, then Allah will soon make you wealthy with His grace, if He wills; indeed Allah is All Knowing, Wise. (* Filthy in body and soul. **Due to loss of trade.)
Fight against the People given the Book(s) who do not accept faith in Allah and the Last Day, and who do not treat as forbidden what is forbidden by Allah and by His Noble Messenger, and who do not follow the true religion, until they pay the tariff with their own hands with humiliation.
And the Jews said, “Uzair is the son of Allah”, and the Christians said “The Messiah is the son of Allah”; they utter this from their own mouths; they speak like the former disbelievers; may Allah kill them; where are they reverting!
They have taken their rabbis and their monks as Gods besides Allah and (also) Messiah the son of Maryam; and they were not commanded except to worship only One God – Allah; none is worthy of worship except Him; Purity is to Him from all that they ascribe as partners (to Him).
They wish to extinguish the light of Allah with their mouths, but Allah will not agree except that He will perfect His light, even if the disbelievers get annoyed.
It is He Who has sent His Noble Messenger with guidance and the true religion, in order to prevail over all other religions – even if the polytheists get annoyed.
O People who Believe! Indeed many of the (Jewish) rabbis and the (Christian) monks unjustly devour people's wealth and prevent from Allah’s way; and those who hoard up gold and silver and do not spend it in Allah’s way – so them give the glad tidings of a painful punishment.
The day when it will be heated in the fire of hell, and their foreheads and their sides and their backs will be branded with them; “Here is what you hoarded for yourselves; so now taste the joy of your hoarding!”
Indeed the number of months before Allah is twelve – in the Book of Allah – since the day He created the heavens and the earth, of which four are sacred; this the straight religion; so do not wrong yourselves in those months; and constantly fight against the polytheists as they constantly fight against you; and know well that Allah is with the pious.
Their postponing of the months is nothing but furtherance in disbelief – the disbelievers are misled by it – they decree it lawful in one year and regard it forbidden in another year, in order to equate to the number of the months which Allah has made sacred, and to make lawful what Allah has forbidden; their evil deeds seem good in their sight; and Allah does not guide the disbelievers.
O People who Believe! What is the matter with you, that when it is said to you, “Migrate in Allah's cause”, you sit on the ground with heaviness?
Have you preferred this worldly life over the Hereafter?
And the wealth of the life of this world, in comparison with the Hereafter, is but only a little.
If you do not migrate, He will afflict you with a painful punishment and bring other people in your stead and you will not be able to harm Him in the least; and Allah is Able to do all things.
If you do not help him (Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), Allah has helped him – when he had to go forth due to the mischief of the disbelievers, just as two men* – when they were in the cave, when he was saying to his companion “Do not grieve; indeed Allah is with us”; then Allah caused His calm to descend upon him and helped him with armies you did not see, and disgraced the word of the disbelievers; and Allah’s Word is supreme; and Allah is the Almighty, the Wise. (* The Holy Prophet migrated only with S. Abu Bakr (who later became the first caliph) as his sole companion.)
Migrate – whether willingly or with a heavy heart and fight in Allah's cause with your wealth and your lives; this is better for you, if you realise.
Had there been some wealth near at hand or a short journey, they would have certainly accompanied you, but the difficult path became very distant for them; and they will now swear by Allah that “Had we been able, we would have surely accompanied you”; they destroy their own souls; and Allah knows that undoubtedly, they are indeed liars.
May Allah forgive you*; why did you permit them** until the truthful ones had been manifested to you and the liars been exposed? (* This is an expression of love for the Holy Prophet – peace and blessings be upon him. ** The hypocrites had been permitted to stay back from the holy war.)
And those who believe in Allah and the Last Day will not seek exemption from you for not fighting with their wealth and their lives; and Allah well knows the pious.
Only those ask for such an exemption from you who do not believe in Allah and the Last Day, and whose hearts are in doubt – so they waver in their doubts.
And if going forth were acceptable to them, they would have made preparations for it, but Allah Himself disliked their getting up (to fight) so He filled them with laze and it was said “Continue sitting with those who remain seated.”
If they had gone forth among you, you would then not gain any increase from them except trouble, and seeking to cause turmoil they would run rumours among you; and their spies are among you; and Allah well knows the unjust.
Indeed they had sought to cause turmoil at the outset, and O dear Prophet the scheme turned otherwise* for you, so much so that the truth came and the command of Allah appeared, and they disliked it. (* In your favour.)
And among them is one who requests you that, “Grant me exemption (from fighting) and do not put me to test”; pay heed!
They have indeed fallen into trial; and indeed hell surrounds the disbelievers.
If good befalls you they dislike it; and were some calamity to befall you, they would say, “We had resolved our matters in advance”, and would turn away rejoicing.
Say, O dear Prophet “Nothing shall befall us except what Allah has destined for us; He is our Master; and the Muslims must rely only on Allah.”
Say, “What do you wait for to happen to us, except one of the two good things?* And for you, we look forward to Allah afflicting you with a punishment from Himself or by our hands; so wait – we too await with you.” (*Death in Allah’s way or victory.)
Say, “Spend willingly or with a heavy heart, it will never be accepted from you; indeed you are a disobedient people.”
And their spending was not stopped being accepted, except because they disbelieved in Allah and His Noble Messenger, and they come to prayer with heavy hearts, and they do not spend except unwillingly.
So let not their riches or their children surprise you; Allah only intends to punish them in the life of this world with these things and that they die only as disbelievers.
And they (the hypocrites) swear by Allah that they are from among you (Muslims); and they are not from among you – however those people are afraid.
If they find some refuge, or caves, or a place to hide, they will break the bonds and return there.
And among them is one who slanders you regarding the distribution of charity; so if they receive some of it they would be happy – and if not, thereupon they get displeased!
How excellent it would be, if they were pleased with what Allah and His Noble Messenger had given them and said, “Allah suffices us; Allah will now give us by His munificence, and (so will) Allah’s Noble Messenger – and towards Allah only are we inclined.”
The obligatory charity* is only for the destitute and the really needy, and those who collect it, and for those in whose hearts the love of Islam needs to be instilled**, and to free slaves, and to debtors, and in Allah's cause***, and to the traveller; this is decreed by Allah; and Allah is All Knowing, Wise. (* This applies only to Zakat. ** The new convert to Islam. *** To the fighter having no provisions for holy war.)
And among them (the hypocrites) are those who trouble* the Herald of the Hidden (the Prophet) and say, “He is only ears**”; say “He is a listener for your good, he believes in Allah and believes in what the Muslims say, and is a mercy for the Muslims among you”; and for those who trouble the Noble Messenger of Allah, is a painful punishment. (*To disrespect / trouble the Holy Prophet – peace and blessings be upon him – is blasphemy. **He believes whatever he is told.)
They swear by Allah in your presence in order to please you; whereas Allah – and His Noble Messenger – had more right that they should have pleased Him if they had faith.
Do they not know that for one who opposes Allah and His Noble Messenger, is the fire of hell, to remain in it forever?
This is the greatest humiliation.
The hypocrites fear for a chapter being revealed regarding them, which may disclose what is hidden in their hearts; say, “Keep mocking; Allah will certainly disclose what you fear.”
And if you ask them, they will say, “We were just having fun and pastime”; say, “What!
You mock at Allah and His verses and His Noble Messenger?”
“Do not feign excuses, you have turned disbelievers after becoming Muslims”; if We forgive some of you*, We shall punish others because they were guilty. (* One who kept quiet and later repented.)
The hypocrite men and women are all the same; enjoining wrong and forbidding right, and being tight-fisted*; they have forgotten Allah, so Allah has forsaken them; indeed the hypocrites – it is they who are really disobedient. (* Not spending in Allah's cause)
Allah has promised the hypocrite men and hypocrite women and the disbelievers, the fire of hell in which they will remain forever; that is sufficient for them; and Allah’s curse is upon them; and for them is a never ending punishment.
Like those who were before you – they were mightier than you in strength, and had more wealth and children than you; so they spent their portion – you spent your portion just as those before you spent their portion and you fell into shame (sin) like they had fallen into shame; their deeds have been wasted in the world and in the Hereafter; it is they who are the losers.
Did not the news of those before them reach them – the people of Nooh, and the A’ad, and the Thamud – the people of Ibrahim, the people of Madyan and the dwellings that were overturned?
Their Noble Messengers had brought clear proofs to them; so it did not befit Allah’s Majesty to oppress them, but in fact they wronged themselves.
And the Muslim men and Muslim women are the friends of one another; enjoining right and forbidding wrong, and keeping the prayer established and paying the obligatory charity, obeying Allah and His Noble Messenger; these are upon whom Allah will soon have mercy; indeed Allah is the Almighty, the Wise.
Allah has promised the Muslim men and Muslim women, Gardens beneath which rivers flow – they will abide in it forever – and pure dwellings in Gardens of everlasting stay; and the greatest (reward) is Allah’s pleasure; this is the supreme success.
O Herald of the Hidden!
Fight against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be stern with them; and their destination hell; and what an evil place to return!
And they swear by Allah that they did not say it; whereas indeed they had certainly uttered the words of disbelief, and after having entered Islam turned disbelievers and had wished for what they did not get; and what annoyed them except that Allah, and His Noble Messenger, made them prosperous with His grace?
So if they repent, it is better for them; and if they turn away, Allah will afflict them with a painful punishment – in this world and the Hereafter; and they will have neither a protector nor any supporter in the entire earth.
And among them are those who made a covenant with Allah that, “If He gives us by His munificence, we will surely give charity and surely become righteous.”
Therefore when Allah gave them by His munificence, they hoarded it and turning their faces, went back.* (* Reneged on their promise).
So following this, Allah put hypocrisy in their hearts until the day when they will meet Him – the result of their breaching the promise made to Allah, and because they lied.
Do they not know that Allah knows their secrets and the schemes they whisper, and that Allah is the All Knowing of all the hidden?
Those who find fault in the Muslims who give the charity wholeheartedly and in those who gain nothing except from their own toil – so they mock at them; Allah will punish them for their mocking; and for them is a painful punishment.
Whether you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) ask forgiveness for them* or not ask forgiveness for them; even if you ask forgiveness for them seventy times, Allah will not forgive them; that is because they disbelieved in Allah and His Noble Messenger, and Allah does not guide the sinful. (* for the hypocrites.)
Those who were left behind rejoiced that behind the Noble Messenger of Allah they had remained seated, and they were unwilling to fight in Allah's cause with their lives or their wealth, and said “Do not venture out in the heat”; say, “The fire of hell is the hottest”; if only they understood!
So they should laugh a little and weep much; the reward of what they used to earn.
Then if Allah takes you back to a group of them and they seek permission from you to go out to fight, say to them, “You shall never go out with me nor ever fight with me against any enemy; you were happy to remain seated for the first time, therefore remain seated with those who stay behind.”
And never offer funeral prayers for any of them* who dies, nor stand by his grave**; indeed they disbelieved in Allah and His Noble Messenger, and they died as sinners. (* It is forbidden to offer funeral prayers for the hypocrites. ** To ask forgiveness for them).
And do not be surprised at their wealth or their children; Allah only wills to torment them with it in this world, and that they pass away upon disbelief.
And when a chapter is sent down that “Accept faith in Allah and fight along with His Noble Messenger”, the men of means among them seek exemption from you and say, “Leave us, for us to be with those who sit.”
They preferred to be with the women who stay behind, and their hearts have been sealed, so they do not understand.
But the Noble Messenger and those who accepted faith with him, fought with their wealth and lives; and for them only are the virtues (rewards); and it is they who have achieved the goal.
Allah has kept ready for them Gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding in it forever; this is the greatest success.
And came the ignorant* who make excuses seeking exemption, and those who lied to Allah and His Noble Messenger remained seated; a painful punishment will soon reach the disbelievers among them. (* of faith)
There is no reproach upon the old nor upon the sick nor upon those who do not have the means to spend, provided they remain faithful to Allah and His Noble Messenger; and there is no way of reproach against the virtuous; and Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
Nor against those who humbly present themselves before you in order that you provide them a mount, and receive an answer from you that “I do not have any beast to carry you” – and so they turn back with eyes overflowing with tears, due to the sorrow that they could not find the means to spend.
The way (of reproach) is only against those who seek exemption from you although they are rich; they preferred to be with the women who stay behind – and Allah has sealed their hearts, so they do not know anything.
They will make excuses to you when you return to them; say, “Do not make excuses – we shall never believe you – Allah has given us your tidings; and Allah and His Noble Messenger will now see your deeds, and then you will return to Him Who knows everything, the hidden and the visible – He will inform you of all what you used to do.”
They will now swear by Allah before you, when you return to them, in order that you do not pay attention to them; so do not bother about them; they are indeed filthy; and their destination is hell; the reward of what they used to earn.
They swear before you that you may be pleased with them; so if you become pleased with them, then indeed Allah will never be pleased with the sinful.
The ignorant are more severe in disbelief and hypocrisy, and deserve to remain ignorant of the commands which Allah has revealed to His Noble Messenger; and Allah is All Knowing, Wise.
And some of the ignorant are those who when spending in Allah's cause consider it a ransom, and await the coming of the cycles (of misfortunes) upon you; upon them only is the evil cycle of misfortune; and Allah is All Hearing, All Knowing.
And some villagers are those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and consider the spending as the means of obtaining proximity to Allah and obtaining the prayers of the Noble Messenger; pay heed!
Yes indeed it is the means of proximity for them; Allah will soon admit them into His mercy; indeed Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
And leading everyone, the first are the Muhajirs* and the Ansar**, and those who followed them with virtue – Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him, and He has kept ready for them Gardens beneath which rivers flow, to abide in it for ever and ever; this is the greatest success. (* The immigrants. **Those who helped the immigrants.)
And some of the illiterates around you are hypocrites; and some of the people of Medinah; hypocrisy has become ingrained in them; you do not know them*; We know them; We shall soon punish them twice** – they will then be consigned towards the terrible punishment.*** (*Until now or as well as We do. ** In life and in the grave *** of hell.)
And there are others who have acknowledged their sins and mixed a good deed with another that was bad; it is likely that Allah will accept their repentance; indeed Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) take the obligatory charity from their wealth, by which you may cleanse them and make them pure, and pray in their favour; indeed your prayer is the contentment of their hearts; and Allah is All Hearing, All Knowing.
Do they not know that Allah only accepts repentance of His bondmen and He takes the charity* and that Allah only is the Most Acceptor of Repentance, the Most Merciful? (* into His control.)
And say “Keep on with your works – Allah will now see your deeds, and so will His Noble Messenger and the Muslims; and soon you will return to the One Who knows everything – the hidden and the visible – so He will inform you of what you used to do.”
And some are kept waiting for Allah’s command – He may punish them or accept their repentance; and Allah is All Knowing, Wise.
And those (hypocrites) who built a mosque to cause harm, and due to disbelief, and in order to cause divisions among the Muslims, and to await the one who is at the outset an opponent of Allah and His Noble Messenger; and they will surely swear that “We wished only good”; and Allah is witness that they are indeed liars.
Never stand (for worship) in that mosque*; indeed the mosque** that has been founded on piety from the very first day deserves that you should stand in it; in it are the people who wish to thoroughly cleanse themselves; and Allah loves the clean. (*The mosque built by the hypocrites. ** The mosque at Quba, built by the Holy Prophet and his companions.
The merit of praying 2 Raka’ Nawafil in it is equal to the reward of an Umrah.)
So is one who established his foundation upon the fear of Allah and upon His pleasure better, or the one who laid his foundation upon the brink of a falling precipice, so it fell along with him into the fire of hell?
And Allah does not guide the unjust.
The building which they erected will constantly keep disturbing their hearts unless their hearts are torn to pieces; and Allah is All Knowing, Wise.
Indeed Allah has purchased from the Muslims their lives and their wealth in exchange of Paradise for them; fighting in Allah's cause, slaying and being slain; a true promise incumbent upon His mercy, (mentioned) in the Taurat and the Injeel and the Qur’an; who fulfils His promise better than Allah?
Therefore rejoice upon your deal that you have made with Him; and this is the great success.
Those who repent, those who worship, those who praise, those who fast, those who bow, those who prostrate, those who show right and forbid wrong and those who keep the limits of Allah in sight; and give glad tidings to the Muslims.
It does not befit the Prophet and those who believe, to pray for the forgiveness of polytheists even if they may be their relatives, after it has become clear to them that they are the people of hell.
And the seeking of forgiveness for his father (paternal uncle) by Ibrahim was only because of a promise he had made to him; then when it became clear to him that he was an enemy of Allah, Ibrahim broke off ties with him; indeed Ibrahim is surely very soft-hearted, most forbearing.
And it does not befit Allah’s Majesty to send a nation astray after He has guided them until He has made clear to them what they should avoid; indeed Allah knows everything.
Indeed for Allah only is the kingship of the heavens and the earth; He gives life and He gives death; and other than Allah, you have neither a Protector nor any Supporter.
Indeed Allah’s mercy inclined towards the Herald of the Hidden, and the Muhajirs and the Ansar who stood by him in the time of hardship, after it was likely that the hearts of a group among them would turn away – He then inclined towards them with mercy; indeed He is Most Compassionate, Most Merciful upon them.
And also upon the three who were kept in waiting; when the earth, vast as it is, was restricted for them, and they became weary of their own lives and became certain that there is no refuge from Allah except with Him; He then accepted their repentance in order that they remain repentant; indeed Allah is the Most Acceptor of Repentance, the Most Merciful.
O People who Believe! Fear Allah, and be with the truthful.
It did not befit the people of Medinah and the people of the villages around them, to stay behind the Noble Messenger of Allah, nor to consider their own lives dearer than his life; that is because the thirst or the pain or the hunger that afflicts them in Allah's cause, and the step they tread on a place that angers the disbelievers, and whatever harm they cause the enemy – a good deed is recorded for them in lieu of all of these; indeed Allah does not waste the wages of the virtuous.
And whatever they spend, small or great, or any valley they cross – it is all recorded for them, so that Allah may reward them for their best deeds.
And it is not possible for the Muslims that all of them go out; so it should be that a party from each group goes forth in order to gain knowledge in religion, and upon returning they warn their people in the hope that they may avoid.
O People who Believe – fight the disbelievers who are near to you, and let them find severity in you, and know well that Allah is with the pious.
And whenever a chapter is sent down, some of them say, “Whose faith among you has this promoted?”
So it has promoted the faith of the believers and they are rejoicing!
And for those in whose hearts is a disease, it has added filth to their filth, and they died as disbelievers.
Do they not observe that they are tested once or twice every year?
Yet they do not repent, nor do they heed advice!
And whenever a chapter is sent down, one of them looks at the other; “Is there someone watching you?” – and then they turn away; Allah has inverted their hearts because they are a people who do not understand.
Indeed there has come to you a Noble Messenger from among you – your falling into hardship aggrieves him, most concerned for your well being, for the Muslims most compassionate, most merciful.
Then if they turn away, say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “Allah suffices me; there is no worship except for Him; only Him have I trusted, and He is the Lord Of The Great Throne.”
Alif-Lam-Ra*; these are verses of the Book of wisdom. (*alphabets of the Arabic language; Allah and to whomever He reveals, know their precise meanings.)
Are people amazed that We have sent to a man among them, the divine revelation that “Warn the people and convey glad tidings to the believers that for them with their Lord is the place* of truth”?
The disbelievers say, “Indeed he is an open magician.” (* Positions of honour on the Day of Resurrection or in heaven.)
Indeed your Lord is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth in six days, then as befits His Majesty, established Himself upon the Throne* – He plans all matters; there is no intercessor except after His permission;* such is Allah, your Lord – therefore worship Him; so do you not ponder? (* Of Control over everything.** Prophet Mohammed (peace and blessings be upon him) will be the first to be granted permission to intercede.)
Towards Him only you all are to return; the promise of Allah; indeed He creates for the first time and then after its extinction creates it again, in order to give those who believe and do good deeds, the reward of justice; and for the disbelievers, boiling water to drink and a painful punishment – the recompense of their disbelief.
It is He Who created the sun radiating and the moon shining and appointed positions for it, for you to know the number of the years, and the account; Allah has not created it except with the truth; He explains the verses in detail for the people of knowledge.
Indeed in the alternation of the day and night, and all that Allah has created in the heavens and the earth, are signs for people who are pious.
Indeed those who do not expect to meet Us and have preferred the worldly life and are content with it, and those who neglect Our signs, –
Their destination is hell – the recompense of their deeds.
Indeed those who accepted faith and did good deeds, their Lord will guide them due to their faith; rivers will flow beneath them in the Gardens of favours.
Their prayers in it will be, “Purity is to You, O Allah” and their greetings in it will be, “Peace”; and the conclusion of their prayers is, “All praise is to Allah, the Lord Of The Creation.”
Were Allah to send misfortune to the people as quickly as they hasten for the good*, their appointed term would have been finished; so We leave those who do not expect to meet Us, to wander in their rebellion. (* The way they wish the good to reach them quickly.)
And when some hardship reaches man he prays to Us, while reclining and sitting and standing; and when We remove his hardship, he goes away as if he had never prayed to Us because of any hardship; this is how the deeds of the transgressors are made seeming good to them.
And indeed We destroyed several generations before you when they crossed the limits – and their respective Noble Messengers came to them with clear proofs, but they were not such as would believe; this is how We reward the guilty.
Then We appointed you as caliphs in the earth after them, in order that We might see what deeds you perform.
And when Our clear verses are recited to them, the people who do not expect to meet Us say, “Bring a Qur’an other than this one, or change it”; say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “I do not have the right to change it on my own; I only follow what is divinely revealed to me; if I were to disobey my Lord*, then I fear the punishment of the Great Day (of Resurrection). (* Which is impossible.)
Say, “Had Allah willed I would not have recited it to you nor would He have made it known to you; so before this* I have spent an age among you; so do you not have sense?” (* Before Allah’s command to recite the Qur’an to you.)
So who is more unjust than one who fabricates a lie concerning Allah and denies His signs?
Indeed the guilty shall never prosper.
And they worship the thing other than Allah, which neither harms them nor benefits them*, and they say, “These are our intercessors** before Allah”; say, “What! You inform Allah of something which in His knowledge does not exist in the heavens or in the earth?”
Purity and Supremacy are to Him, above their association. (* Some things like the sun, stars, trees are useful but they too are created by Allah.
Their worship will not benefit – in fact it is harmful ** Only the virtuous will be granted permission by Allah to intercede.)
Mankind were only one nation* and then they differed, and had it not been for a promise** from your Lord, the matters in which they differed would have been decided here itself. (* On one proper faith. ** The account on the Last Day.)
And they say, “Why is not a sign sent down upon him from his Lord?”
Proclaim, (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “The hidden is only for Allah, therefore wait; I too am waiting with you.”
And when We give mankind the taste of mercy after some hardship which had afflicted them, they immediately start conspiring against Our signs; proclaim, “The secret plan of Allah is the fastest”; indeed Our angels record your scheming.
It is He Who transports you over the land and the sea; to the extent that when you are in ships – and the ships sail with them with a favourable breeze and they rejoice at it – a gust of strong wind reaches them and waves come to them from every side and they realise that they are surrounded, – thereupon they pray to Allah as His sincere bondmen that, “If You rescue us from this, we will surely be thankful.”
Then when He rescues them, they start wrongfully committing oppression in the earth; O mankind!
Your oppression is only a torment against yourselves; derive the benefit until you live in this world; you have then to return to Us and thereupon We shall show you your misdeeds.
The example of the life of this world is similar to the water which We sent down from the sky, so due to it the earth’s vegetation grew in abundance – that which men and cattle eat; to the extent that when the earth has taken on her ornaments and is well beautified, and her owners thought that it is within their control, Our command came to it at night or at day – so We made it harvested as if it had not existed yesterday; this is how We explain the verses for the people who ponder.
And Allah calls to the abode of peace, and guides whomever He wills on the Straight Path.
For the people of virtue, is goodness and more than that; and neither will the blackness nor disgrace come upon their faces; it is they who are the people of Paradise; they will abide in it forever.
And (for) those who earned evil*, the recompense of evil is equal to it – and disgrace will come upon them; they will have no one to save them from Allah; as if their faces are covered with pieces of the dark night; it is they who are the people of the fire; they will remain in it forever. (* The disbelievers.)
And on the day when We raise all of them together, then say to the polytheists, “Stay in your place – you and your partners (false deities)”; so We shall separate them from the believers, and their partners will say to them, “When did you ever worship us!?”
“Therefore Allah suffices as a Witness between us and you, that we were not even aware that you worshipped us!”
Here will every soul come to know what it has sent ahead, and they will be returned to Allah – their true Master, and they will lose all that they used to fabricate.
Say, (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “Who provides you sustenance from the sky and the earth?
Or Who is the Owner of the ears and the eyes?
And Who brings forth the living from the dead and Who brings forth the dead from the living?
And Who plans all matters?”
So they will now say, “Allah”; therefore say, “Then why do you not fear?”
So such is Allah, your True Lord; therefore what remains after the truth, except error?
So where are you reverting?
This is how the Word of your Lord is proved concerning the sinful, so they will not believe.
Say, “Is there any one among your partners (false deities) that can create for the first time and then after its extinction, create it again?”
Proclaim, “Allah creates for the first time and then after its extinction, creates it again – so where are you reverting?”
Say, “Is there any among your partners that shows the right path?”
Say, “Allah shows the right path; so who should be obeyed – the One Who shows the right path, or one who does not even find the right path unless he is guided?
So what has happened to you?
What sort of a judgement you impose!”
And most of them do not follow anything except assumptions; indeed assumption does not serve the least purpose (in place) of the truth; indeed Allah knows their deeds.
And this noble Qur’an is not such that anyone can invent it, without Allah revealing it – but it surely is a confirmation of the Books preceding it and is an explanation of all that is written on the (preserved) tablet – there is no doubt in it – it is from the Lord Of The Creation.
What! They dare say that “He has fabricated it”?
Say, “Then bring one chapter like it and, other than Allah, call everyone you can if you are truthful.”
On the contrary, they denied the thing the knowledge of which they could not master, whereas they have not yet seen its outcome; similarly those before them had denied, therefore see what sort of fate befell the unjust!
And among them is one who accepts faith in it, and among them is one who does not accept faith in it; and your Lord well knows the mischievous.
And if they deny you, say, “For me are my deeds, and for you are your deeds; you have no concern with what I do, and I have no relation with what you do.”
And among them are some who listen to you; so will you make the deaf hear even if they do not have any sense?
And among them is one who gazes at you; so will you guide the blind* even if they cannot perceive? (* Deaf or blind to guidance.)
Indeed Allah does not oppress men at all, but they do wrong themselves.
And on the day when He will raise all of them together, as if they had never stayed on earth except for a moment during the day, they will recognise one another; for completely ruined are those who denied the meeting with Allah and were not on guidance.
And whether We show you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) part of what We promise them or whether We call you towards Us before it – in any case they have to return to Us – then Allah is the Witness of their deeds.
And in every nation was a Noble Messenger (from Allah); so when their Noble Messenger came to them, they were judged with fairness, and they were not wronged.
And they say, “When will this promise come, if you are truthful?”
Say, “I have no autonomy to benefit or hurt myself, except what Allah wills*; for every nation is a fixed promise; when their promise comes, they cannot postpone it nor can they advance it one moment. (* To empower me.)
Say, “What is your opinion – if His punishment comes upon you at night or during the day, so what is there in it for which the guilty are being hasty?”
“So will you believe it only when it has occurred?
What!
You believe in it now, whereas you were impatient* for it before? (* Eagerly demanding for it to occur.)
Then the unjust will be told, “Taste the punishment forever; and you will be repaid only what you used to earn.”
And they ask you “Is it a reality*?”
Say, “Yes, by oath of my Lord, indeed surely it is a reality, and you will not be able to escape.” (* The punishment of the hereafter.)
And if each unjust soul owned everything that is in the earth, it would have certainly given it in order to redeem itself; and they secretly felt repentant when they saw the punishment; and it has been judged between them with fairness and they will not be wronged.
Pay heed! Indeed everything that is in the heavens and the earth belongs only to Allah; pay heed!
Indeed Allah’s promise is true, but most of them do not know.
And He gives life and gives death, and towards Him you will return.
O mankind!
The advice has come to you from your Lord and a cure for the hearts – and guidance and mercy for believers.
Say, “Upon Allah’s munificence and upon His mercy – upon these should the people rejoice”; that is better than all their wealth and possessions.
Say, “What is your opinion – (regarding) the sustenance that Allah has sent down for you? So you have, on your own, deemed lawful and unlawful in it!”; say, “Has Allah given you permission for it, or do you fabricate a lie against Allah?”
And what do they, who fabricate lies against Allah, assume will be their state on the Day of Resurrection?
Indeed Allah is Most Munificent upon mankind, but most people are not thankful.
And whatever work you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) are engaged in and recite a part of the Qur’an from Him, and whatever you people do, We are Witness upon you from the time you begin it; and there is nothing in the earth or in the heaven worth the weight of the smallest particle hidden from your Lord, nor anything smaller or greater than it, which is not recorded in a clear Book.
Indeed upon the friends of Allah is neither any fear, nor any grief. (The friends of Allah are the best in the creation.)
Those who have accepted faith and practice piety.
There are good tidings for them in the life of this world and in the Hereafter; the Words of Allah cannot change; this is the supreme success.
And do not grieve at their speech (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him); indeed all honour is for Allah and He is the All Hearing, the All Knowing.
Indeed all those in the heavens and all those in the earth are in Allah’s control; and what do those who pray to the partners instead of Allah, follow? They do not follow anything except assumption, and they only make guesses.
It is He Who created the night for you so that you may gain rest in it and the day giving sight; indeed in this are signs for the people who heed.
They said, “Allah has created a son for Himself”- Purity is to Him! He is the Perfect (Unwanting, free of needs); to Him only belongs all whatever is in the heavens and all whatever is in the earth; “You do not have any proof of this; do you say a thing concerning Allah which you do not know?”
Say, “Indeed those who fabricate lies against Allah will never succeed.”
Enjoying a little in the earth, they have then to return to Us – We will then make them taste a severe punishment, the recompense of their disbelief.
Read to them the story of Nooh; when he told his people, “O my people – if my standing here and reminding you of Allah’s signs have been intolerable for you – so I have trusted only Allah – then work jointly and strengthen your work along with your false deities, leaving no doubt regarding your work – then do whatever you can to me, and do not give me respite.”
“Then if you turn away, I do not ask any fee from you; my reward is only upon Allah, and I am commanded to be of the Muslims.”
In response they denied him, so We rescued him and those with him in the ship, and made them caliphs, and We drowned those who denied Our signs; therefore see what sort of fate befell those who had been warned!
Then after him, We sent other Noble Messengers to their respective people – so they came to them with clear proofs – so they were not such as to believe in what they had denied before; this is how We set seals upon the hearts of rebels.
Then after them, We sent Moosa and Haroon along with Our signs, to Firaun and his court members, so they were proud and were a guilty people.
So when the truth came to them from Us, they said, “Indeed this is a clear magic.”
Said Moosa, “What! You speak in this manner regarding the truth when it has come to you?
Is this magic?
And magicians never succeed.”
They said, “Have you two come to us to revert us from what we found our fathers upon, and that the leadership in the land may only be for you two?
And we shall never believe in you both.”
And Firaun said, “Bring every expert magician to me.”
So when the magicians came, Moosa said to them, “Cast whatever you intend to cast.”
Therefore when they had cast, Moosa said, “This what you have brought, is magic; Allah will now make it void; indeed Allah does not make the works of the mischievous successful.”
“And Allah will prove the truth by His Words, even if the guilty get annoyed.”
So none accepted faith in Moosa, except a few descendants of his people, fearing Firaun and his court members, that they would force them to revert; and indeed Firaun was a rebel in the land; and indeed he crossed the limits.
And Moosa said, “O my people! If you have accepted faith in Allah, then you should rely only upon Him, if you are Muslims.”
They said, “We have relied only upon Allah; Our Lord!
Do not make us a test* for the unjust people.” (* By giving them power over us.)
“And with Your mercy, rescue us from the disbelievers.”
And We sent the divine revelation to Moosa and his brother that, “Build houses for your people in Egypt and make your houses as places of worship, and keep the prayer established, and give glad tidings to the Muslims.”
And Moosa prayed, “Our Lord! You have given Firaun and his chiefs adornment and wealth in the life of this world, our Lord, that they may lead astray from Your path; our Lord!
Destroy their riches and harden their hearts so that they may not accept faith until they witness the painful punishment.”
He said, “The prayer of you two is accepted, therefore remain firm, and do not follow the way of the unwise.”
And We transported the Descendants of Israel across the sea, therefore Firaun and his army pursued them with rebellion and injustice; until when the drowning overcame him he cried, “I accept faith that there is no True God except the One in Whom the Descendants of Israel believe, and I am a Muslim.”
“What!
Now?* Whereas you were disobedient from the start and you were mischievous!” (This was said to Firaun.* Accepting faith at the time of death is of no use.)
“This day We shall salvage your body so that you may be a sign for those after you; and indeed most people are neglectful of Our signs.”
And indeed We provided the Descendants of Israel a place of honour, and bestowed good sustenance to them; and they did not fall into dispute except after the knowledge had come to them; indeed your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning the matters in which they used to differ.
And if you, O listener, have any doubt in what We have sent down towards you, then question those who have read the Book before you; undoubtedly, towards you has come the truth from your Lord, therefore do not be of those who doubt.
And never be of those who denied the signs of Allah, for you will then be of the losers.
Indeed those for whom the Word of your Lord has proved true, will not believe.
Even if every sign comes to them, until they witness the painful punishment.
So if only had there been one dwelling* that believed and its belief would have benefited it – except the nation of Yunus (Jonah)!
When they accepted faith, We removed the disgraceful punishment in the life of this world from them, and let them enjoy for a while. (* That was destroyed after being warned.)
And if your Lord willed, all those who are in the earth – everyone of them – would have accepted faith; so will you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) force the people until they become Muslims?
And no soul can accept faith except by the command of Allah; and He sets the punishment upon those who do not have sense.
Proclaim, “Observe what is in the heavens and the earth”; and the signs and the Noble Messengers do not benefit the people who are not destined to believe.
So what are they waiting for, except the days similar to the days of those who passed away before them?
Say, “Then wait! I too am waiting with you.”
Then We shall save Our Noble Messengers and the believers – this is it; it is incumbent upon Our mercy to save the Muslims.
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “O people! If you are in doubt concerning my religion, then (know that) I will never worship those whom you worship instead of Allah – but I worship Allah Who will give you death; and I am commanded to be of the believers.”
“And that ‘Set your face straight* for religion, apart from all others; and never be of those who ascribe partners (to Allah)’.” (* Your intention sincerely for religion.)
“And other than Allah, do not worship that which cannot benefit you nor cause you harm; then if you do so, you would be of the unjust.” (* Some things like the sun, stars, trees are useful but they too are created by Allah.
Their worship will not benefit – in fact it is harmful.)
“And if Allah afflicts you with some suffering, there is none who can remove it except Him; and if He wills good for you, there is none who can repel His munificence; He bestows it upon whomever He wills from among His bondmen; He is the Oft Forgiving, the Most Merciful.” (* Help, cure, monetary aid etc., whatever benefit derived from any source, reaches us because Allah has given the source this power and is actually through the grace and mercy of Allah.)
Say, “O people!
The truth* has come to you from your Lord; so whoever came to guidance, has come to guidance for his own benefit; and whoever strayed, has strayed for his own harm; and I am not a trustee over you.” (* Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him, or Islam or the Qur’an.)
And (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) follow what is divinely revealed to you, and have patience till Allah gives His command; and He is the Best of Rulers.
Alif-Lam-Ra*; “This is a Book, the verses of which are full of wisdom – then explained in detail – from the Wise, the Well Aware.” (* Alphabets of the Arabic language; Allah and to whomever He reveals, know their precise meanings.)
“That do not worship anyone except Allah; indeed I am for you a Herald of Warning and Glad Tidings, from Him.”
“And ask forgiveness from your Lord and incline towards Him in repentance, He will provide you excellent sustenance until the appointed time and will bestow superiority to every one who excels; and if you turn away, I then fear the punishment of the Great Day upon you.”
“To Allah only you have to return, and He is Able to do all things.”
Pay heed! They fold up their breasts in order to conceal from Allah; pay heed!
Even when they fully cover themselves up with their clothes, Allah knows all that what hide and all what they disclose; indeed He knows what is in the hearts.
And there is none that walks upon the earth whose sustenance does not depend on the mercy of Allah – He knows where it shall stay and where it shall be deposited; everything is in a clearly explaining Book.
And it is He Who created the heavens and the earth in six days – and His Throne was upon the water – so that He might test you, as to who among you have the best deeds*; and if you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) say, “Indeed you will be raised again after death”, the disbelievers will surely say, “This is nothing but clear magic.” (* The creation of all things is in order to test mankind.)
And if We postpone the punishment upon them for a specified time, they will surely say, “What holds it back?”
Pay heed! On the day when it comes upon them, it will not be averted from them, and the very punishment they mocked at will encompass them.
And if We bestow man the enjoyment of some mercy from Us and later withdraw it from him; surely he is most despairing, ungrateful.
And if We bestow upon him the enjoyment of a favour after a misfortune that had befallen him, he will surely say, “The evils have gone away from me”; indeed he is jubilant, boastful.
Except those who patiently endured and did good deeds; for them is forgiveness, and a great reward.
So will you forsake part of what is divinely revealed to you and be disheartened because they say, “Why has not a treasure been sent down along with him?”, or “An angel should have come with him”? You are purely a Herald of Warning*; and Allah is the Guardian over all things. (* Therefore do not grieve over their sayings.)
What! They dare say that “He has fabricated it”?
Say “Therefore bring ten fabricated chapters like these, and call on everyone you can other than Allah, if you are truthful.”
So O Muslims, if they are unable to reply to this challenge of yours, then know well that it is sent down only with the knowledge of Allah; and that except Him, there is no real God; so will you now accept?
Whoever desires the life of this world and its comforts, We shall give them the full reward for their deeds in it, and not make any reduction in it.
These are the ones for whom there is nothing in the Hereafter except the fire; and all that they did there has gone to waste and all their deeds are destroyed.
So is the one who is upon the clear proof* from his Lord, and comes a witness upon it from Allah, and before it the Book of Moosa, a leader and a mercy; they accept faith in it; and whoever denies it from all the groups, then the fire is promised for him; so O listener, do not have any doubt concerning it; indeed it is the truth from your Lord; but most people do not believe. (* The Jews who accepted faith in the Qur’an.)
And who is more unjust than the one who fabricates a lie against Allah?
They will be presented before their Lord, and the witnesses* will say, “These are they who lied concerning their Lord; the curse of Allah be upon the unjust!” (* The Prophets and angels.)
Those who prevent from the way of Allah and wish deviation in it; and it is they who disbelieve in the Hereafter.
They will not be able to escape in the earth, nor do they have any protecting friends apart from Allah; they will have punishment upon punishment; they were unable to hear, nor used to see. (* Hear or see the truth.)
It is they who put their souls into ruin, and they lost all that they used to fabricate.
They will be, unnecessarily, the greatest losers in the Hereafter.
Indeed those who believed and performed good deeds and directed themselves towards their Lord – they are the people of Paradise; they will abide in it forever.
The example of the two groups is like one being blind and deaf, and the other seeing and hearing; are they equal in condition?
So do you not ponder?
And indeed We sent Nooh to his people that, “Indeed I am for you a clear Herald of Warning.”
“That you must worship none except Allah; indeed I fear the punishment of the calamitous day upon you.”
The chiefs of his people, who were disbelievers, said, “We see that you are just a mortal like us, and we do not see anyone following you except the most lowly among us, without insight; and we do not find any merit in you above us – in fact, we consider you liars.”
He said, “O my people! What is your opinion – if I am on a clear proof from my Lord and He has bestowed mercy upon me from Him, so you remained blind towards it; shall we force it upon you although you dislike it?”
“And O my people! I do not ask any wealth from you for it; my reward is only upon Allah, and I am not going to repel the Muslims; indeed they will meet their Lord, but I find you people completely ignorant.”
“And O my people! Who would rescue me from Allah if I repel them?
So do you not think?”
“And I do not say to you, ‘I have the treasures of Allah’ nor that ‘I gain knowledge of the hidden’, nor do I say that, ‘I am an angel’ nor do I say to those whom your sights consider lowly, that Allah will never give them any good; Allah well knows what is in their hearts; if I do so, I would then be of the unjust.”
They said, “O Nooh, you have disputed with us and disputed in the extreme, therefore bring upon us what you promise us, if you are truthful.”
He said, “Allah will surely bring that upon you if He wills, and you will not be able to escape.”
“And my advice will not benefit you if I wish you good, when Allah wills to keep you astray; He is your Lord and to Him you will return.”
What! They dare say that, “He has fabricated it”?
Say, “If I may have fabricated it, then my sin is upon me, and I am unconcerned with your sins.”
And it was divinely revealed to Nooh that “None of your people will become Muslims, except those who have already accepted faith – therefore do not grieve at what they do.”
“And build the ship in front of Us, and by Our command, and do not speak to Me regarding the unjust; they will surely be drowned.”
And Nooh builds the ship; and whenever the chiefs of his people passed by him, they used to laugh at him; he said, “If you laugh at us, then a time will come when we will laugh at you just as you laugh.”
“So now you will come to know – upon whom comes the punishment that disgraces him, and upon whom descends the punishment that continues forever.”
To the extent that when Our command came and the oven overflowed, We said, “Board into the ship a couple – male and female – from every kind, and your family members, except those upon whom the Word has been passed*, and all other Muslims”; and only a few Muslims were with him. (* Whose fate has been sealed.)
And he said, “Board it – upon Allah’s name is its movement and its stopping; indeed my Lord is surely Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.”
And the same carries them amid waves like mountains; and Nooh called out to his son whereas he was standing apart, “O my son! Embark along with us*, and do not be with the disbelievers.” (* As a Muslim.)
He said, “I shall take the refuge of a mountain – it will save me from the water”; said Nooh, “Today there is none who can rescue from the punishment of Allah, except upon whom He has mercy”; and the wave came in between them, so he remained amongst the drowning.
And it was commanded, “O earth, swallow your water and, O sky, stop” – and the water was dried up and the matter was completed – and the ship stopped upon the mount Al-Judi and it was said, “Away with the unjust nation!”
And Nooh prayed to his Lord – submitted he, “My Lord! Indeed my son is also of my family, and surely Your promise is true and You are the Greatest Ruler of all.”
He said, “O Nooh, he is not of your family; his deeds are most improper; therefore do not ask Me a thing of which you do not have knowledge; I advise you not to be unwise.”
He submitted, “My Lord! I seek your refuge from asking you the thing of which I do not have knowledge; and if You do not forgive me and do not have mercy on me, I would then be a loser.”
It was said, “O Nooh!
Alight from the ship along with peace from Us and the blessings that are upon you and upon some groups that are with you; and some groups are those whom We shall let enjoy this world and then a painful punishment from Us will reach them.”
These are the tidings of the hidden, which We reveal to you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him); you did not know them nor did your people, before this; therefore patiently endure; indeed the excellent fate is for the pious.
And towards the people of A’ad, their fellow man Hud; he said, “O my people!
Worship Allah – there is no other True God except Him; you are purely fabricators.”
“O my people! I do not ask any fee from you for it; my reward is only upon Him Who has created me; so do you not have sense?”
“And O my people! Seek forgiveness from your Lord, then incline towards Him in repentance – He will send abundant rain from the sky upon you and will give you much more strength than you have – and do not turn away committing crimes!”
They said, “O Hud! You have not come to us with any proof and we will not forsake our deities upon your saying, nor will we believe you.”
“We only say that you have been severely struck by one of our deities”; he said, “I make Allah a witness, and you all bear witness that I have no relation with whatever you ascribe (as partners to Allah)”-
“Besides Him – therefore all of you scheme against me and do not give me respite.”
“I rely upon Allah, Who is my Lord and your Lord; there is not a creature that walks, whose forelock is not in His control; indeed my Lord can be found on the Straight Path.”
“Then if you turn away, I have conveyed to you what I was sent with towards you; and my Lord will bring others in your stead; and you will not be able to cause Him any harm; indeed my Lord is a Guardian over all things.”
And when Our command came, We rescued Hud and the Muslims who were with him, by Our mercy; and We saved them from a severe punishment.
And these are the A’ad – they denied the signs of their Lord and disobeyed His Noble Messengers and followed the commands of every stubborn disobedient.
And a curse followed them in the world, and on the Day of Resurrection; pay heed! Indeed A’ad disbelieved in their Lord; away with A’ad, the people of Hud!
And to the Thamud tribe, We sent their fellow man Saleh; he said, “O my people!
Worship Allah, there is no other True God except Him; He created you from the earth and established you in it, so seek forgiveness from Him and incline towards Him in repentance; indeed my Lord is Close, Acceptor of Prayer.”
They said, “O Saleh! You seemed very promising among us, before this – What!
You forbid us from worshipping the deities of our forefathers?
And indeed we have fallen into a deeply intriguing doubt concerning what you call us to.”
He said, “O my people! What is your opinion – if I am on clear proof from my Lord and He has bestowed upon me mercy from Him, so who will rescue me from Allah if I disobey Him?
So you will not increase anything for me, except loss!”
“And O my people! This is the she-camel of Allah – a sign for you – so let her graze in Allah’s earth, and do not touch her with an evil intention for an imminent punishment will reach you.”
In response they hamstrung her, he therefore said, “Enjoy a further three days in your homes; this is a promise that will not be untrue.”
Therefore when Our command came, We rescued Saleh and the Muslims who were with him by Our mercy, and from the disgrace of that day; indeed your Lord is the Strong, the Almighty.
And the terrible scream seized the unjust – so at morning they remained lying flattened in their homes.
As if they had never lived there; indeed the tribe of Thamud disbelieved in their Lord; away with the Thamud!
And indeed Our angels came to Ibrahim with glad tidings – they said, “Peace”; he answered, “Peace” and without delay brought a roasted calf.
And when he saw their hands not reaching towards it, he thought they were pretending and inwardly started fearing them; they said, “Do not be afraid – we are sent to the people of Lut.”
And his wife was standing by and she started laughing*, so We gave her glad tidings regarding Ishaq, and following Ishaq, regarding Yaqub.** (* She was glad that the disbelieving people of Lut would be destroyed.** The birth of these two.)
She said, “Oh woe to me – will I bear a child whereas I am an old woman, and this my husband, is an old man?
This is something really extraordinary.”
The angels said, “Do you wonder at the command of Allah?
Allah’s mercy and His blessings be upon you, O people of this house; indeed He only is Most Praiseworthy, Most Honourable.”
And when Ibrahim’s fear abated and the glad tidings reached him, he argued with Us regarding the people of Lut.
Indeed Ibrahim is most forbearing, very soft hearted, penitent.
“O Ibrahim, turn away from this; indeed your Lord’s command has come; and indeed a punishment will come upon them, which will not be averted.”
And when Our angels came to Lut, he was distressed for them and was disheartened due to them, and said, “This is a day of great hardship.”
And his people came running towards him; and they were in the habit of committing evil deeds; he said, “O my people!
These women of the tribe are my daughters* – they are purer for you – therefore fear Allah and do not disgrace me in the midst of my guests; is there not even a single righteous man among you?” (* The wives of those people.)
They said, “You know that we have no right to the daughters of your tribe; and you obviously know what we desire.”
He said, “If only I had the strength against you or were able to get the refuge of some strong support!”
The angels said, “O Lut! We are the sent ones of your Lord – they cannot get to you, therefore during the night take your entire household with you – and not one of you may turn around and see – except your wife*; she too will be afflicted with the same as they will be; indeed their promise is at morn; is not the morning imminent?” (* She was a disbeliever and sided with the culprits.)
So when Our command came, We turned that township upside down and showered it continuously with stones of fired clay.
That are marked, in the custody your Lord; and those stones are not at all far from the unjust!
And to Madyan their fellow man Shuaib; he said, “O my people! Worship Allah – there is no other True God except Him; and do not make reductions in measure and weight – indeed I see you prosperous, and I fear the punishment of the Besieging Day (of Resurrection) upon you.”
“O my people! Measure and weigh in full with justice, and do not give the people their goods diminished, and do not roam about in the earth causing turmoil.”
“That which remains from Allah’s bestowal is better for you, if you believe; and I am not at all a guardian over you.”
They said, “O Shuaib! Does your prayer command you that we forsake the deities of our forefathers or that we may not do as we wish with our own property?
Yes indeed – only you are very intelligent, most righteous*.” (* They mocked at him with sarcasm.)
He said, “O my people! What is your opinion – if I am on a clear proof from my Lord and He has bestowed me with an excellent sustenance from Him (shall I ignore all this?); and the matter I forbid you to do, I do not wish that I myself act against it; I only intend to make improvements as far possible; my guidance is only from Allah; I rely only upon Him and towards Him only do I incline.”
“And O my people! May not your opposition to me occasion the coming upon you of the thing similar to what befell the people of Nooh or the people of Hud or the people of Saleh; and the people of Lut are not at all far from you!”
“Ask forgiveness from your Lord and then incline towards Him in repentance; indeed my Lord is Most Merciful, Most Affectionate.”
They said, “O Shuaib! We do not understand most of what you say, and indeed we perceive you weak among us; were it not for your relatives, we would have stoned you; and in our sight, you have no respect at all.”
He said, “O my people! Is the pressure upon you from my relatives, worth more than Allah?
And you put Him* behind your backs; indeed whatever you do is all within my Lords’ control.” (* His command / my preaching.)
“And O my people! Keep on with your works in your positions, I am doing mine; very soon you will come to know – upon whom comes the punishment that will disgrace him, and who is the liar; and wait – I too am waiting with you.”
And when Our command came, We rescued Shuaib and the Muslims who were with him by Our mercy; and the terrible scream seized the unjust – so at morning they remained lying flattened in their homes.
As if they had never lived there; away with the Madyan, just as the Thamud were removed afar!
And indeed We sent Moosa with Our revelations and a clear domination.
Towards Firaun and his court members, thereupon they followed the commands of Firaun; and the work of Firaun was not proper.
He will lead his people on the Day of Resurrection, therefore landing them into hell; and what a wretched place to land into!
And a curse followed them in the world, and on the Day of Resurrection; what a wretched gift is what they received.
These are the tidings of the townships, which We relate to you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) – some of them still stand and some are cut off.
And We did not oppress them at all, but it is they who wronged themselves – therefore their deities, whom they worshipped other than Allah, did not in the least benefit them when your Lord’s command came; and due to them, they increased nothing but ruin.
And similar is the seizure of your Lord when He seizes the townships upon their injustice; indeed His seizure is painful, severe.
Indeed in this is a sign for one who fears the punishment of the Hereafter; this is the day on which everyone will be gathered, and this is the Day of Attendance.
And We do not postpone it except for a fixed term.
When that day comes, no one will speak without His permission; so among them are the ill-fated and the fortunate.
So those who are ill-fated, are in the fire – they will bray like donkeys in it.
Remaining in it as long as the heavens and the earth remain, except as much as your Lord willed*; indeed your Lord may do whatever, whenever, He wills. (* Remaining forever even after the heavens and the earth are destroyed.)
So those who are fortunate are in Paradise – abiding in it as long as the heavens and the earth remain, except as much as your Lord willed; this is the everlasting favour.
So O listener (followers of this Prophet), do not fall into doubt by what these disbelievers worship; they only worship just as their forefathers worshipped before; and indeed we shall pay them their due in full, undiminished.
And indeed We gave Moosa the Book, hence there was discord regarding it; and were it not for a Word that had been previously passed from your Lord, the matter would have immediately been decided regarding them; and indeed they are in an intriguing doubt concerning it.
And indeed to each and every one, your Lord will fully repay his deeds; He is Informed of their deeds.
Therefore remain firm the way you are commanded to, and those who have turned along with you, and O people – do not rebel; indeed He is seeing your deeds.
And do not incline towards the unjust, for the fire will touch you – and you do not have any supporter other than Allah – then you will not be helped.
And keep the prayer established at the two ends of the day and in some parts of the night; indeed good deeds wipe out the evil deeds; this is an advice to those who heed it.
And have patience, for Allah does not waste the wages of the righteous.
So why were not there some people, from the generations before you, who had some goodness remaining in them in order to prevent (others) from causing turmoil in the earth?
Except a few among them – the very ones whom We had rescued; and the unjust remained pursuing what they were given, and they were guilty.
And your Lord is not such as to destroy townships without reason, while their people are righteous.
And had your Lord willed, He would have made mankind one nation – and they will always keep differing.
Except those upon whom your Lord had mercy; and this is why He created them; and the Word of your Lord has been concluded that, “Indeed I will, surely, fill hell with jinns and men combined.”
And We relate to you all the accounts of Noble Messengers, in order to steady your heart with it; and in this the truth has come to you, and for the Muslims a preaching and advice.
And say to the disbelievers, “Keep on with your works in your places; we are carrying out ours.”
“And wait – we too are waiting.”
“And for Allah only are the hidden of the heavens and of the earth, and towards Him only is the return of all matters – therefore worship Him and trust Him; and your Lord is not unaware of what you do.”
Alif-Lam-Ra*; these are verses of the clear Book. (* Alphabets of the Arabic language; Allah and to whomever He reveals, know their precise meanings.)
Indeed We have sent down an Arabic Qur’an, so that you may perceive.
We relate to you the best narrative because We have sent the divine revelation of this Qur’an, to you; although surely you were unaware before this.
Remember when Yusuf (Joseph) said to his father, “O my father! I saw eleven stars and the sun and the moon – I saw them prostrating to me.”
He said, “O my child! Do not relate your dream to your brothers, for they will hatch a plot against you; indeed Satan is an open enemy towards mankind.”
“And this is how your Lord will choose you and teach you how to interpret events, and will perfect His favours upon you and upon the family of Yaqub, the way He perfected it upon both your forefathers, Ibrahim and Ishaq; indeed your Lord is All Knowing, Wise.”
Indeed in Yusuf and his brothers are signs* for those who enquire**. (* Of the truthfulness of Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him. ** The Jews who enquired about their story.)
When they said, “Indeed Yusuf and his brother* are dearer to our father than we are, and we are one group; undoubtedly our father is, clearly, deeply engrossed in love.” (* Of the same mother.)
“Kill Yusuf or throw him somewhere in the land, so that your father’s attention may be directed only towards you, and then after it you may again become righteous!”
A speaker among them said, “Do not kill Yusuf – and drop him into a dark well so that some traveller may come and take him away, if you have to.”
They said, “O our father! What is the matter with you that you do not trust us with Yusuf, although we are in fact his well-wishers?”
“Send him with us tomorrow so that he may eat some fruits and play, and indeed we are his protectors.”
He said, “I will indeed be saddened by your taking him away, and I fear that the wolf may devour him, whilst you are unaware of him.” (* Prophet Yaqub knew of what was about to happen.)
They said, “If the wolf devours him, whereas we are a group, then surely we are useless!”
So when they took him away – and all of them agreed that they should drop him in the dark well; and We sent the divine revelation to him, “You will surely tell them of their deed at a time when they will not know.”
And at nightfall they came to their father, weeping.
Saying, “O our father! We went far ahead while racing, and left Yusuf near our resources – therefore the wolf devoured him; and you will not believe us although we may be truthful.”
And they brought his shirt stained with faked blood; he said, “On the contrary – your hearts have fabricated an excuse for you; therefore patience is better; and from Allah only I seek help against the matters that you relate.”
And there came a caravan – so they sent their water-drawer, he therefore lowered his pail; he said, “What good luck, this is a boy!”; and they hid him as a treasure; and Allah knows what they do.
And the brothers sold him for an improper price, a limited number of coins; and they had no interest in him.
And the Egyptian who purchased him said to his wife, “Keep him honourably – we may derive some benefit due to him or we may adopt him as our son”; and this is how we established Yusuf in the land, and that We might teach him how to interpret events; and Allah is Dominant upon His works, but most men do not know.
And when he matured to his full strength, We bestowed him wisdom and knowledge; and this is how We reward the virtuous.
And the woman in whose house he was, allured him not to restrain himself and she closed all the doors – and said, “Come! It is you I address!”; he said, “(I seek) The refuge of Allah – indeed the governor is my master – he treats me well; undoubtedly the unjust never prosper.”
And indeed the woman desired him; and he too would have desired her were he not to witness the sign of his Lord*; this is what We did, to turn away evil and lewdness from him; indeed He is one of Our chosen bondmen. (* Allah saved him and he never desired this immorality.)
And they both raced towards the door, and the woman tore his shirt from behind, and they both found her husband at the door; she said, “What is the punishment of the one who sought evil with your wife, other than prison or a painful torture?”
Said Yusuf, “It was she who lured me, that I may not guard myself” – and a witness from her own household testified; “If his shirt is torn from the front, then the woman is truthful and he has spoken incorrectly.”
“And if his shirt is torn from behind, then the woman is a liar and he is truthful.”
So when the governor saw his shirt torn from behind, he said, “Indeed this is a deception of women; undoubtedly the deception of women is very great.”
“O Yusuf! Disregard this – and O woman!
Seek forgiveness for your sin; indeed you are of the mistaken.”
And some women of the city said, “The governor’s wife is seducing her young slave; indeed his love has taken root in her heart; and we find her clearly lost.”
And when she heard of their secret talk, she sent for them and prepared cushioned mattresses for them and gave a knife to each one of them and said to Yusuf, “Come out before them!”
When the women saw him they praised him and cut their hands, and said, “Purity is to Allah – this is no human being; this is not but an honourable angel!”
She said, “This is he on whose account you used to insult me; and indeed I tried to entice him, so he safeguarded himself; and indeed if he does not do what I tell him to, he will surely be imprisoned, and will surely be humiliated.”
He said, “O my Lord! Prison is dearer to me than the deed they invite me to; and if You do not repel their deceit away from me, I may incline towards them and be unwise.”
So his Lord heard his prayer and repelled the women’s deceit away from him; indeed He only is the All Hearing, the All Knowing.
Then after having seeing all the signs, they all decided that he should be imprisoned for some time.
And two young men went to prison along with him; one of them said, “I dreamt that I am pressing wine”; the other said, “I dreamt that I am carrying some bread upon my head from which birds were eating”; “Tell us their interpretation; indeed we see that you are virtuous.”
Said Yusuf, “The food which you get will not reach you, but I will tell you the interpretation of this before it comes to you; this is one of the sciences my Lord has taught me; indeed I did not accept the religion of the people who do not believe in Allah and are deniers of the Hereafter.”
“And I have chosen the religion of my forefathers, Ibrahim and Ishaq and Yaqub; it is not rightful for us to ascribe anything as a partner to Allah; this is a grace of Allah upon us and upon mankind, but most men are not thankful.”
“O both my fellow-prisoners! Are various lords better, or One Allah, the Dominant above all?”
“You do not worship anything besides Him, but which are merely names coined by you and your forefathers – Allah has not sent down any proof regarding them; there is no command but that of Allah; He has commanded that you do not worship anyone except Him; this is the proper religion, but most people do not know.”
“O my two fellow-prisoners! One of you will give his lord (the king) wine to drink; regarding the other, he will be crucified, therefore birds will eat from his head; the command has been given concerning the matter you had enquired about.”
And of the two, Yusuf said to the one whom he sensed would be released, “Remember me, in the company of your lord”; so Satan caused him to forget to mention Yusuf to his lord, he therefore stayed in prison for several years more.
And the king said, “I saw in a dream seven healthy cows whom seven lean cows were eating, and seven green ears of corn and seven others dry; O court-members!
Explain my dream, if you can interpret dreams.”
They answered, “These are confused dreams – and we do not know the interpretation of dreams.”
And of the two the one who was released said – and after a long time he had remembered – “I will tell you its interpretation, therefore send me forth.”
O truthful one! Explain for us the seven healthy cows which seven lean cows were eating and the seven green ears of corn and seven others dry, so I may return to the people, possibly they may come to know.”
He said, “You will cultivate for seven years continuously; so leave all that you harvest in the ear, except a little which you eat.”
“Then after that will come seven hard years which will devour all that you had stored for them, except a little which you may save.”
“Then after that will come a year when the people will be given rain and in which they will extract juices.”
And the king said, “Bring him to me”; so when the bearer came to him, Yusuf said, “Return to your lord and ask him what is the status of the women who had cut their hands; indeed my Lord knows their deception.”
The king said, “O women!
What was your role when you tried to entice Yusuf?”
They answered, “Purity is to Allah – we did not find any immorality in him”; said the wife of the governor, “Now the truth is out; it was I who tried to entice him, and indeed he is truthful.”
Said Yusuf, “I did this so that the governor may realise that I did not betray him behind his back, and Allah does not let the deceit of betrayers be successful.”
“And I do not portray my soul as innocent; undoubtedly the soul excessively commands towards evil, except upon whom my Lord has mercy; indeed my Lord is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.”
And the king said, “Bring him to me so that I may choose him especially for myself”; and when he had talked to him he said, “Indeed you are today, before us, the honourable, the trusted.”
Said Yusuf, “Appoint me over the treasures of the earth; indeed I am a protector, knowledgeable.”
And this is how We gave Yusuf the control over that land; to stay in it wherever he pleased; We may convey Our mercy to whomever We will, and We do not waste the wages of the righteous.
And undoubtedly the reward of the Hereafter is better, for those who accept faith and remain pious.
And Yusuf’s brothers came and presented themselves before him, so he recognised them whereas they remained unaware of him.
And when he provided them with their provisions he said, “Bring your step-brother to me; do you not see that I measure in full and that I am the best host?”
“And if you do not bring him to me, there shall be no measure (provisions) for you with me and do not ever come near me.”
They said, “We will seek him from his father – this we must surely do.”
He said to his slaves, “Place their means back into their sacks, perhaps they may recognise it when they return to their homes, perhaps they may come again.”
So when they returned to their father, they said, “O our father! The provisions have been denied to us, therefore send our brother with us so that we may bring the provisions, and we will surely protect him.”
He said, “Shall I trust you regarding him the same way I had trusted you earlier regarding his brother?
Therefore Allah is the Best Protector; and He is More Merciful than all those who show mercy.”
And when they opened their belongings they found that their means had been returned to them; they said, “O our father!
What more can we ask for?
Here are our means returned to us; we may get the provision for our homes and guard our brother, and get a camel-load extra; giving all these is insignificant for the king.”
He said, “I shall never send him with you until you give me an oath upon Allah that you will bring him back to me, unless you are surrounded”; and (recall) when they gave him their oath that “Allah’s guarantee is upon what we say.” (* He knew that Bin Yamin would be restrained.)
And he said, “O my sons! Do not enter all by one gate – and enter by different gates; I cannot save you against Allah; there is no command but that of Allah; upon Him do I rely; and all those who trust, must rely only upon Him.”
And when they entered from the place where their father had commanded them to; that would not at all have saved them against Allah – except that it was Yaqub’s secret wish, which he fulfilled; and indeed he is a possessor of knowledge, due to Our teaching, but most people do not know.
And when they entered in the company Yusuf, he seated his brother close to him and said, “Be assured, I really am your brother – therefore do not grieve for what they do.”
And when he had provided them their provision, he put the drinking-cup in his brother’s bag, and then an announcer cried, “O people of the caravan! You are indeed thieves!”
They answered and turned towards them, “What is it you cannot find?”
They said, “We cannot find the king’s cup, and for him who brings it is a camel-load, and I am its guarantor.”
They said, “By Allah, you know very well that we did not come here to cause turmoil in the land, and nor are we thieves!”
They said, “And what shall be the punishment for it, if you are liars?”
They said, “The punishment for it is that he in whose bag it shall be found, shall himself become a slave for it; this is how we punish the unjust.”
So he first searched their bags before his brother’s bag, then removed it from his brother’s bag; this was the plan We had taught Yusuf; he had no right to take his brother by the king’s law, except if Allah wills; We may raise in ranks whomever We will; and above every possessor of knowledge is another scholar.
They said, “If he steals, then indeed his brother has stolen before”; so Yusuf kept this in his heart and did not reveal it to them; he replied within himself, “In fact, you are in a worse position; and Allah well knows the matters you fabricate.”
They said, “O governor! He has a very aged father, so take one of us in his stead; indeed we witness your favours.”
He said, “The refuge of Allah from that we should take anyone except him with whom our property was found – we would then surely be unjust.”
So when they did not anticipate anything from him, they went away and started consulting each other; their eldest brother said, “Do you not know that your father has taken from you an oath upon Allah, and before this, how you had failed in respect of Yusuf?
Therefore I will not move from here until my father permits or Allah commands me; and His is the best command.”
“Return to your father and then submit, ‘O our father! Indeed your son has stolen; we were witness only to what we know and we were not guardians of the unseen.’
‘And ask the township in which we were, and the caravan in which we came; and indeed we are truthful.’”
Said Yaqub, “Your souls have fabricated an excuse for you; therefore patience is excellent; it is likely that Allah will bring all* of them to me; undoubtedly only He is the All Knowing, the Wise.” (* All three including Yusuf.)
And he turned away from them and said, “Alas – the separation from Yusuf!” and his eyes turned white with sorrow, he therefore kept suppressing his anger.
They said, “By Allah, you will keep remembering Yusuf till your health fails you or you lose your life.”
He said, “I complain of my worry and grief only to Allah, and I know the great traits of Allah which you do not know.”
“O my sons, go and search for Yusuf and his brother, and do not lose hope in the mercy of Allah; indeed none lose hope in the mercy of Allah except the disbelieving people.”
Then when they reached in the company of Yusuf they said, “O governor! Calamity has struck us and our household, and we have brought goods of little value, so give us the full measure and be generous to us; undoubtedly Allah rewards the generous.”
He said, “Are you aware of what you did to Yusuf and his brother when you were unwise?”
They said, “Are you, in truth you, really Yusuf?”
He said, “I am Yusuf and this is my brother; indeed Allah has bestowed favour upon us; undoubtedly whoever practices piety and patience – so Allah does not waste the wages of the righteous.”
They said, “By Allah, undoubtedly Allah has given you superiority over us, and we were indeed guilty.”
He said, “There is no reproach on you, this day!
May Allah forgive you – and He is the Utmost Merciful, of all those who show mercy.”
“Take along this shirt of mine and lay it on my father’s face, his vision will be restored; and bring your entire household to me.”
(Prophet Yusuf knew that this miracle would occur.)
When the caravan left Egypt, their father said*, “Indeed I sense the fragrance of Yusuf, if you do not call me senile.” (* Prophet Yaqub said this in Palestine, to other members of his family. He could discern the fragrance of Prophet Yusuf’s shirt from far away.)
They said, “By Allah, you are still deeply engrossed in the same old love of yours.”
Then when the bearer of glad tidings came, he laid the shirt on his face, he therefore immediately regained his eyesight*; he said, “Was I not telling you?
I know the great traits of Allah which you do not know!” (This was a miracle that took place by applying Prophet Yusuf’s shirt.)
They said, “O our father! Seek forgiveness for our sins, for we were indeed guilty.”
He said, “I shall soon seek forgiveness for you from my Lord; indeed He only is the Oft Forgiving, the Most Merciful.”
So when they all reached in Yusuf’s company, he kept his parents close to him, and said, “Enter Egypt, if Allah wills, in safety.”
And he seated his parents on the throne, and they all prostrated before him; and Yusuf said, “O my father! This is the interpretation of my former dream; my Lord has made it true; and indeed He has bestowed favour upon me, when He brought me out of prison and brought you all from the village, after Satan had created a resentment between me and my brothers; indeed my Lord may make easy whatever He wills; undoubtedly He is the All Knowing, the Wise.”
“O my Lord! you have given me a kingdom* and have taught me how to interpret some events; O Creator of the heavens and the earth – you are my Supporter in the world and in the Hereafter; cause me to die as a Muslim, and unite me with those who deserve Your proximity.” (* Prophethood and the rule over Egypt.
Prophet Yusuf said this prayer while his death approached him.)
These are some tidings of the Hidden which We divinely reveal to you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him); and you were not with them when they set their task and when they were scheming.
And however much you long for, most men will not accept faith.
You do not ask them any fee in return for it; this is not but an advice to the entire world.
And how many signs exist in the heavens and the earth, over which most people pass and remain unaware of them!
And most of them are such that they do not believe in Allah except while ascribing partners (to Him)!
Do they remain complacent over Allah’s punishment coming and surrounding them, or the Last Day coming suddenly upon them whilst they are unaware?
Proclaim, “This is my path – I call towards Allah; I, and whoever follows me, are upon perception; and Purity is to Allah – and I am not of the polytheists.”
And all the Noble Messengers We sent before you, were exclusively men – towards whom We sent the divine revelations, and were dwellers of townships; so have not these people travelled in the land and seen what sort of fate befell those before them?
And undoubtedly the abode of the Hereafter is better for the pious; so do you not have sense?
To the extent that when the Noble Messengers lost hope from the visible means, and the people thought that they had spoken wrongly, Our help came to them – therefore whoever We willed was saved; and Our punishment is never averted from the guilty.
Indeed in their tidings is enlightenment for the men of understanding; this (the Qur’an) is not some made up story but a confirmation of the Books before it, and a detailed explanation of all things, and a guidance and a mercy for the Muslims.
Alif-Lam-Meem-Ra*; these are verses of the Book; and that which has been sent down upon you from your Lord is true, but most men do not believe. (* Alphabets of the Arabic language – Allah and to whomever He reveals, know their precise meanings.)
It is Allah Who raised up the heavens without columns for you to observe, then (in the manner befitting His Majesty) established Himself upon the Throne (of control), then subjected the sun and the moon; each one runs for up to an appointed term; Allah plans the works and explain the signs in detail, so that you may believe in meeting with your Lord.
And it is He Who spread out the earth and made mountains as anchors and rivers in it; and in it made all kinds of fruits in pairs – He covers the night with the day; indeed in this are signs for people who ponder.
And in the earth are various regions, and are close to each other – and gardens of grapes and fields, and date-palms, growing from a single branch and separately, all being given one water; and in fruits, We make some better than others in eating; indeed in this are signs for people of intellect.
And if you are amazed, then indeed the amazement is at their saying that, “Will we, after having turned to dust, be created anew?”
They are those who have disbelieved in their Lord; and they are those who will have shackles around their necks; and they are the people of hell; remaining in it forever.
And they urge you to hasten the punishment before the mercy, whereas the punishments of those before them have concluded; and indeed your Lord gives the people a sort of pardon* despite their injustice; and indeed the punishment of your Lord is severe. (* By delaying their punishment despite their disbelief.)
The disbelievers say, “Why is not a sign sent down upon him from his Lord?”
You are purely a Herald of Warning, and a guide for all nations.
Allah knows all what is inside the womb of every female, and every increase and decrease of the wombs; and all things are with Him by a set measure.
The All Knowing of all things hidden and visible, the Great, the Supreme.
Equal* are the one among you who speaks softly and one who speaks aloud, and one who is hidden during the night and one who walks during the daytime. (* For Allah.)
For man are angels of alternating duties, in front and behind him, who guard him by Allah’s command; indeed Allah does not change His favour upon any nation until they change their own condition; and when Allah wills misfortune for a nation, it cannot be repelled; and they do not have any supporter besides Him.
It is He Who shows you the lightning, for fear and for hope, and raises the heavy clouds.
And the thunder proclaims His purity with praise, and the angels out of fear of Him; and He sends the bolt of lightning – it therefore strikes upon whom He wills, whilst they are disputing concerning Allah; and severe is His seizure.
Only the prayer to Him is truthful; and whomever they pray to besides Him, do not hear them at all, but like one who has his hands outstretched towards water that it may come into his mouth, and it will never come; and every prayer of the disbelievers remains wandering.
And to Allah only prostrate all those who are in the heavens and in the earth, willingly or helplessly – and their shadows – every morning and evening. (Command of prostration # 2).
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth?”
Proclaim, “Allah”; Say, “So have you appointed such as supporters besides Him, who can neither benefit nor harm themselves?”; say, “Will the blind and the sighted ever be equal?
Or will the realms of darkness and the light ever be equal?”
Have they appointed such as partners to Allah who created something like Allah did? Therefore their creation and His creation seemed alike to them?
Proclaim, “Allah is the Creator of all things, and He Alone is the Dominant over all.”
He sent down water from the sky, so valleys flowed according to their measure, therefore the water flow brought forth the froth swollen upon it; and upon which they ignite the fire, to make ornaments and tools, from that too rises a similar froth; Allah illustrates that this is the example of the truth and the falsehood; the froth then bursts and disappears; and that which is of use to people, remains in the earth; this is how Allah illustrates the examples.
For those who obeyed the command of Allah is goodness and if those who did not obey Him owned all that is in the earth and in addition a similar one like it, they would give it to redeem their souls; it is they who will have a wretched account, and their destination is hell; and what a wretched resting place!
So will he, who knows that what is sent down upon you from your Lord is the truth, ever be equal to him who is blind?
Only the men of understanding heed advice.
Those who fulfil the pact of Allah, and do not renege on the covenant.
Those who unite what Allah has commanded to be united, and fear their Lord, and apprehend the evil of the account.
Those who were patient in order to gain their Lord’s pleasure and kept the prayer established and spent in Our cause part of what We bestowed upon them, secretly and openly, and repel evil by responding with goodness – for them is the gain of the final abode.
The everlasting Gardens of Eden which they will enter, and the deserving among their forefathers and their wives and their descendants – the angels will enter upon them from every gate.
(Saying), “Peace be upon you, the recompense of your patience – so what an excellent gain is the final abode!”
And those who break the pact of Allah after its ratification, and sever what Allah has commanded to be joined, and spread turmoil in the earth – their share is only the curse and their destiny is the wretched abode.
Allah eases and restricts the sustenance for whomever He wills; and the disbelievers rejoiced upon the life of this world; and the life of this world, as compared with the Hereafter, is just a brief utilisation.
And the disbelievers said, “Why was not a sign sent down upon him from his Lord?”
Proclaim, “Indeed Allah sends astray whomever He wills, and guides towards Himself the one who comes towards Him.”
“Those who accepted faith and whose hearts gain solace from the remembrance of Allah; pay heed!
Only in the remembrance of Allah is the solace of hearts!”
“Those who accepted faith and did good deeds – for them is joy and an excellent outcome.”
Similarly We sent you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) towards the nation, before whom other nations have passed away, for you to recite to them the divine revelations We sent down to you, whereas they are denying the Most Gracious; proclaim, “He is my Lord – there is no worship except for Him; I rely only upon Him and only towards Him is my return.”
And were such a Qur’an to come that would cause the mountains to move, or the earth to split asunder, or the dead to speak, even then these disbelievers would not believe; in fact, all matters are only at Allah’s discretion; so have not the Muslims despaired in that, had Allah willed, He would have guided all mankind? Disasters shall continue to strike the disbelievers on account of their deeds, or descend near their homes until Allah’s promise comes; indeed Allah does not break the promise.
And indeed the Noble Messengers before you were also mocked – I therefore gave the mockers respite for some days and then seized them; so how (dreadful) was My punishment!
So is He who keeps a watch over the deeds of every soul (equal to their appointed partners)?
And (yet) they ascribe partners to Allah!
Proclaim, “Just name them – or is it that you inform Him of something which in His knowledge does not exist in the earth – or is it just superficial talk?”
In fact, their deceit seems good to the disbelievers and are prevented from the path; and whomever Allah sends astray, so there is none to guide him.
They will be punished in the life of this world, and indeed the punishment of the Hereafter is the most severe; and there is none to save them from Allah.
A description of the Paradise which is promised to the pious; rivers flow beneath it; its fruits are unending, and its shade; this is the reward of those who fear; and the fate of the disbelievers is fire.
And those to whom We gave the Book* rejoice at what is divinely revealed to you**; and of those groups are some who deny parts of it; proclaim, “I am commanded only that I worship Allah and not ascribe any partner to Him; towards Him do I call, and towards Him only I have to return.” (* Scholars among the Jews and Christians who accepted faith. ** The Holy Qur’an.)
And similarly We have revealed this as a command in Arabic; and O listener (follower of this Prophet), if you follow their desires after the knowledge having come to you, then you will have neither a supporter nor any saviour against Allah.
And indeed We sent Noble Messengers before you, and made wives and children for them; and it is not the task of any Noble Messenger to bring a sign except by Allah’s command; and all promises have a time prescribed.
Allah erases and confirms whatever He wills; and only with Him is the real script.
And whether We show you a promise that is given to them, or call you to Us before it – so in any case, upon you is just the conveyance*, and for Us is the taking of the account. (* Of the message.)
Do they not perceive that We are reducing their dwellings from all directions?
And Allah gives the command – there is none that can postpone His command; and He spends no time in taking account.
And indeed those before them had plotted; therefore Allah Himself is the Master of all strategies; He knows all what every soul earns; and soon will the disbelievers realise for whom is the final abode.
The disbelievers say, “You are not a (Noble) Messenger (of Allah)”; proclaim, “Allah is a Sufficient Witness between me and you, and (so is) he who has knowledge of the Book.”
Alif-Lam-Ra; it is a Book which We have sent down upon you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) so that you may bring forth people from the realms of darkness into light – by the command of their Lord, towards the path of the Most Honourable, the Most Praiseworthy.
Allah – because all that is in the heavens and in the earth belongs only to Him; and woe is for the disbelievers through a severe punishment.
To whom the worldly life is dearer than the Hereafter, and who prevent from the way of Allah and wish deviations in it; they are in extreme error.
And We sent every Noble Messenger with the same language as his people*, so that he may clearly explain to them; then Allah sends astray whomever He wills, and He guides whomever He wills; and He only is the Most Honourable, the Wise. (* Prophet Mohammed (peace and blessings be upon him) was taught all the languages as he is sent towards all.)
And indeed We sent Moosa along with Our signs that, “Bring your people from the realms of darkness into light – and remind them of the days of Allah*; indeed in them are signs for every greatly enduring, grateful person.” (* When various favours were bestowed – in order to give thanks and be patient.)
And when Moosa said to his people, “Remember Allah’s favour upon you when He rescued you from the people of Firaun who were inflicting you with a dreadful torment, and were slaying your sons and sparing your daughters; and in it occurred a great favour of your Lord.”* (* On the 10th day of Moharram – therefore the Jews used to fast on that day as thanksgiving.)
And remember when your Lord proclaimed, “If you give thanks, I will give you more, and if you are ungrateful then (know that) My punishment is severe.”
And Moosa said, “If you and all who are in the earth turn disbelievers, then indeed Allah is definitely Independent (Unwanting), Most Praiseworthy.”
Did not the tidings of those before you reach you? The people of Nooh, and the A’ad and the Thamud, and those after them?
Only Allah knows them; their Noble Messengers came to them with clear proofs, they therefore raised their hands towards their own mouths, and said, “We disbelieve in what you have been sent with, and we are in a deeply intriguing doubt regarding the path you call us to.”
Their Noble Messengers said, “What!
You doubt concerning Allah, the Creator of the heavens and the earth?
He calls you that He may forgive some of your sins and until the time of death give you a life free from punishment”; they said, “You are just human beings like us; you wish to prevent us from what our forefathers used to worship – therefore now bring some clear proof to us.”
Their Noble Messengers said to them, “We are indeed human beings like you, but Allah bestows favour upon whomever He wills, among His bondmen*; it is not our task to bring any proof to you except by the command of Allah; and only upon Allah must the Muslims rely.” (* Therefore Prophets and other men are not equal in status.)
“And what is the matter with us that we should not rely on Allah?
He has in fact shown us our ways; and we will surely be patient upon the troubles you cause us; and those who trust must rely only upon Allah.”
And the disbelievers said to their Noble Messengers, “We will surely expel you from our land, unless you accept our religion”; so their Lord sent them the divine revelation that, “Indeed We will destroy these unjust people.”
“And indeed We will establish you in the land after them; this is for him who fears to stand before Me and fears the commands of punishment declared by Me.”
And they sought a decision, and every stubborn rebel was destroyed.
Hell went after him, and he will be made to drink liquid pus*. (* Discharged from the wounds of other people in hell.)
He will sip it with difficulty but be unable to swallow, and death will approach him from every side and he will not die; and a severe punishment is after him.
The state of those who disbelieve in their Lord is that their deeds are like ashes which the strong wind blew away on a stormy day; they got nothing from all that they earned; this is the extreme error.
Have you not seen that Allah has created the heavens and the earth with true purpose?
If He wills, He can remove you all and bring a new creation.
And this is not at all difficult for Allah.
They will all publicly come in the presence of Allah – then those who were weak will say to those who were the leaders, “We were your followers – is it possible for you to avert some of Allah’s punishment from us?”
They will answer, “If Allah had guided us, we would have guided you; it is the same for us, whether we panic or patiently endure – we have no place of refuge.” (* This conversation will take place between the disbelievers and their leaders.)
And Satan will say when the matter has been decided, “Indeed Allah had given you a true promise – and the promise I gave you, I made it untrue to you; and I had no control over you except that I called you and you obeyed me; so do not accuse me, blame only yourselves; neither can I help you, nor can you help me; I have no concern with your ascribing me as a partner (to Allah); indeed for the unjust is a painful punishment.”
And those who believed and did good deeds will be admitted into Gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding in it forever, by the command of their Lord; their greeting in it is “Peace”.
Did you not see how Allah illustrated the example of a sacred saying?
Like a sacred tree, which has firm roots and branches reaching into heaven.
Bearing fruit at all times by the command of its Lord; and Allah illustrates examples for people so that they may understand.
And the example of a bad saying is like a filthy tree, which is cut off above the ground, therefore not having stability.
Allah keeps the believers firm upon the truth in the life of this world and in the Hereafter; and Allah sends the unjust astray; and Allah may do whatever He wills.
Did you not see those who exchanged the grace of Allah for ungratefulness and led their people down to the home of destruction?
Which is hell; they will enter it; and what a wretched place of stay!
And they ascribed equals to Allah to mislead from His way; say, “Enjoy a while, for your end will be the fire.”
Say to the bondmen of Mine who believe, that they must keep the prayer established and spend in Our way from what We have given them, secretly and publicly, before the advent of a day in which there will be no trade nor friendship.
It is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth, and sent down water from the sky, therefore producing some fruits for you to eat; and subjected the ships for you, that they may sail upon the sea by His command; and subjected the rivers for you.
And subjected the sun and the moon for you, which are constantly moving; and has subjected the night and the day for you.
And He gave you much of what you seek; and if you enumerate the favours of Allah, you will never be able to count them; indeed man is very unjust, most ungrateful.
And remember when Ibrahim prayed, “O my Lord! Make this town (Mecca) a safe one, and safeguard me and my sons from worshipping idols.”
“O my Lord! The idols have led many people astray; so whoever followed me, is indeed mine; and whoever disobeyed me – then indeed You are Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.”
“O our Lord! I have settled some of my descendants in a valley having no cultivation, near Your Sacred House – O our Lord!
So that they may keep the prayer established, therefore incline some hearts of men towards them, and provide them fruits to eat – perhaps they may be thankful.”
“O our Lord! You know what we hide and what we disclose; and nothing is hidden from Allah, neither in the earth nor in the heavens.”
“All praise is to Allah Who gave me Ismail and Ishaq, in my old age; indeed my Lord is the Listener of Prayer.”
“O my Lord! Maintain me as one who establishes prayer, and some of my descendants; O our Lord! and accept my prayer.”
“O our Lord! And forgive me, and my parents, and all the Muslims on the day when the account will be established.”
And do not ever assume that Allah is unaware of what the unjust do; He does not give them respite but for a day in which the eyes will become fixed, staring.
They shall come out running in bewilderment, with their heads raised, their gaze not returning to them; and their hearts will not have any calm.
And warn the people of a day when the punishment will come upon them, therefore the unjust will say, “O our Lord!
Give us respite for a little while – for us to obey Your call and follow the Noble Messengers”; (It will be said) “So had you not sworn before that, ‘We have not to move to any place else from the earth’?”
“And you dwelt in the houses of those who had wronged themselves and it became very clear to you how We had dealt with them, and We illustrated several examples for you.”
And indeed they carried out their scheme, and their scheming is within Allah’s control; and their scheme was not such that could move these mountains*. (* The revelations / signs of Allah.)
So do not ever assume that Allah will not fulfil His promise to His Noble Messengers; indeed Allah is the Dominant, the Avenger.
On the day when the earth will be changed to other than this earth, and the heavens – and they will all come forth standing before Allah, the One, the Dominant above all.
And on that day you will see the guilty linked together in chains.
Their cloaks will be of pitch and fire will cover their faces.
In order that Allah may repay each soul what it had earned; indeed Allah spends no time in judging the account.
This is the message to be conveyed to all mankind – and in order to warn them with it, and for them to know that He is the only One God, and for men of understanding to heed advice.
Alif-Lam-Ra; these are verses of the Book and the bright Qur’an.
The disbelievers will ardently wish that if only they had been Muslims! (At the time of death / in their graves / on the Day of Resurrection.)
Leave them to eat and enjoy, and for aspiration to involve them in play – so they will shortly come to know.
And every dwelling that We destroyed, had a known decree for it.
No group may advance its appointed promise nor postpone it.
And they said, “O you upon whom the Qur’an has been sent, you are indeed insane.”
“Why do you not bring angels to us, if you are truthful?”
We do not send down angels without reason, and if the angels descend they would not get any respite!
(This is one of the miracles of the Qur’an – no one has been able to change even one letter of its text, despite every effort. It has remained in its original form since the 6th Century (A. D) and will remain so forever.
And indeed We sent Noble Messengers before you, to the former nations.
And never does a Noble Messenger come to them, but they mock at him.
This is how We make the mocking* enter the hearts of the guilty. (* The acts of disbelief.)
They do not believe in him, and the tradition of earlier nations has passed.
And if We open for them a gate in the heavens, to ascend it through the day –
Even then they would say, “Our sights have been hypnotised – in fact, a magic spell has been cast upon us.”
And indeed We created towers in the skies, and beautified it for the beholders.
And We have kept it guarded from every outcast devil.
Except one who comes to eavesdrop – therefore a bright flame goes after him.
And We spread out the earth, and placed mountains as anchors in it, and in it grew all things by a proper measure.
And created livelihoods for you in it, and created those for whom you do not provide the sustenance.
And there is not a thing the treasure* of which is not with Us; and We do not send it down except by a known measure. (* The power to create it.)
And We sent the winds that relieve the clouds’ burden, therefore caused water to descend from the sky, then give it to you to drink; and you are not at all its treasurers.
And indeed it is We Who give life and it is We Who cause death, and We are the Inheritors.
And indeed We know those among you who came forward and indeed We know those among you who remained behind.
Indeed your Lord only will raise them all on the Day of Resurrection; indeed only He is Wise, All Knowing.
Indeed We created man from sounding clay made out of black smelly mud.
And created the jinn before him, from smokeless fire.
And recall when your Lord said to the angels, “I will create man from sounding clay made out of black smelly mud.”
“Therefore when I have properly fashioned him and breathed into him a chosen noble soul from Myself, fall down before him in prostration.”
Therefore all the angels, each and every one of them, fell prostrate.
Except Iblis (Satan); he refused to be among those who prostrated.
Said Allah, “O Iblis! What happened to you that you stayed apart from those who prostrated?”
He answered, “It does not befit me to prostrate myself to a human whom You have created from sounding clay made out of black smelly mud.”
Said Allah, “Therefore exit from Paradise, for you are an outcast.”
“And indeed you are accursed till the Day of Judgement.”
He said, “My Lord! Grant me respite till the day when they will all be raised.”
Said Allah, “You are of those given respite.”
“Till the Day of a well-known time.”
He said, “My Lord! I swear by the fact that You sent me astray, I shall distract them in the earth, and I shall lead all of them astray.”
“Except those among them who are Your chosen bondmen.”
Said Allah, “This path* leads straight towards Me.” (* The path of the chosen bondmen.)
“Indeed you do not have any power over My bondmen, except those wanderers who follow you.” (The devil is unsuccessful in tempting Allah’s chosen bondmen to commit sin.)
And indeed hell is the promise for all of them.
It has seven gates; for each gate is a portion assigned from them.
Indeed the pious are amidst Gardens and springs.
“Enter them with peace, in safety.”
And We have removed any resentments which were in their breasts – they are brothers, sitting face to face on thrones.
Neither any hardship is to reach them in it, nor are they to be expelled from it.
Inform My bondmen that undoubtedly, I surely am the Oft-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.
And that indeed the punishment of Mine is a painful punishment.
And inform them of Ibrahim’s guests.
When the angels came to him and said, “Peace"; he said, “We feel afraid of you.”
They said, “Do not fear – we convey to you the glad tidings of a knowledgeable boy.”
He said, “Do you convey to me the glad tidings upon old age reaching me? So upon what do you convey glad tidings?” (* Prophet Ibrahim said this out of surprise.)
They said, “We have given you true tidings, therefore do not lose hope.”
He said, “Who is it that despairs from the mercy of his Lord, except those who are astray?”
He said, “And what is your next task, O the sent angels?”
They said, “We have been sent towards a guilty nation.”
“Except the family of Lut; we shall rescue all of them.”
“Except his wife – we have decided that she is of those who will stay behind.”
And when the sent angels came to the house of Lut.
He said, “You are an unfamiliar people.”
They said, “In fact we have brought to you the matter which these people doubted.”
“And we have brought to you a true command, and indeed we are truthful.”
“Therefore journey with your household while a portion of the night remains, and you tread behind them – and none of you may turn around and see, and proceed directly to the place you are commanded to.”
And We informed him the decision of this command, that at morning the root of the disbelievers would be cut off.
And the people of the city came rejoicing. (* To the house of Prophet Lut.)
He said, “These are my guests – do not dishonour me.”
“And fear Allah and do not disgrace me.”
They said, “Had we not forbidden you from meddling in the affairs of anyone?”
He said, “These women of our tribe are my daughters, if you have to.”
By your life O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) – they are indeed straying in their intoxication.
Therefore the scream overcame them at sunrise.
And We turned the township upside down and rained upon them stones of heated clay.
Indeed in this are signs for people who perceive.
And indeed that township is upon a road still in use.
Indeed in this are signs for the believers.
And indeed the Dwellers of the Woods were unjust.
We therefore took revenge from them; and indeed both these townships are situated on an open road.
And the people of the Hijr (rocks) denied the Noble Messengers.
And We gave them Our signs, and they remained averse to them.
And they used to carve dwellings in the hills, without fear.
So the scream overcame them at morning.
Therefore their earnings did not in the least benefit them.
And We have not created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, except with the Truth; and indeed the Last Day will come, therefore (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), forbear graciously.
Indeed your Lord only is the Great Creator, the All Knowing.
And indeed We have given you seven verses that are repeated, and the great Qur’an.
Do not direct your eyes towards the things We have given to some of their couples to enjoy, and do not at all grieve because of them, and take the Muslims within the folds of your mercy.
And proclaim, “Indeed I, yes I, am the clear Herald of Warning.”
(Of a punishment) Like the one We sent down upon the dividers.
Those who broke the Word of Allah into several parts. (Those who broke the Torah / Bible or changed its text – or those who called the Qur’an a fabrication / poetry.)
Therefore, by your Lord, We shall question every one of them.
About all what they used to do.
Therefore publicly announce what you are commanded, and turn away from the polytheists.
Indeed We suffice you against these mockers.
Those who ascribe another God along with Allah; so they will soon come to know.
And indeed We know that you are disheartened by their speech.
Therefore proclaim the Purity of your Lord with praise, and be of those who prostrate.
And keep worshipping your Lord, till death* comes to you. (* The certainty.)
The command of Allah is arriving soon, therefore do not seek to hasten it; Purity and Supremacy are to Him, above all the partners (they ascribe).
He sends down the angels with the soul of faith – the divine revelations – towards those among His bondmen He wills that, “There is no worship except for Me, therefore fear Me.”
He created the heavens and the earth with the truth; Supreme is He above their ascribing of partners (to Him).
He created man from a drop of fluid, yet he is an open quarreller!
And He created cattle; in them are warm clothing and uses for you, and you eat from them.
And in them is your elegance, when you bring them home at evening, and when you leave them to graze.
And they transport your loads to a town where you could not reach except utterly exhausted; indeed your Lord is Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.
And horses, and mules, and donkeys so that you may ride them, and for adornment; and He will create what you do not know*. (* All modern means of transport – by air, sea, land and even in space – evidence this.)
And the middle path rightly leads to Allah – any other path is wayward; and had He willed He would have brought all of you upon guidance.
It is He Who sent down water from the sky – you drink from it, and from it are trees you use as pasture.
With this water He produces for you crops, and olives, and dates, and grapes, and all kinds of fruit; indeed in this is a sign for people who ponder.
And He subjected the night and the day for you – and the sun and the moon; and the stars are subjected to His command; indeed in this are signs for people of intellect.
And the things He has created for you in the earth, of numerous colours; indeed in this is a sign for people who remember.
And it is He Who subjected the sea for you, so you eat fresh meat from it, and extract ornaments from it which you wear; and you see ships ploughing through it and in order that you may seek His munificence and that you may give thanks.
And He placed mountains as anchors in the earth so that it may not shake along with you, and streams and roads for you to find course.
And landmarks; and they are guided by the star.
So will He Who creates ever be like one who does not create?
So do you not heed advice?
And if you enumerate the favours of Allah, you will never be able to count them; indeed Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
And Allah knows what you conceal and what you disclose.
And those whom they worship other than Allah, do not create anything but are themselves created.
They are dead, not alive; and they do not know when will the people be raised.
Your God is One God; so those who do not believe in the Hereafter – their hearts deny and they are proud.
Certainly Allah knows what they hide and what they disclose; indeed He does not like the proud.
And when it is said to them, “What has your Lord sent down?”, they say, “The tales of former people.”
In order to bear their full burdens on the Day of Resurrection, and some burdens of those whom they mislead with their ignorance; pay heed!
What an evil burden they bear!
Indeed those before them had plotted, so Allah seized the foundations of their building, therefore the roof fell down upon them from a height, and the punishment came upon them from a place they did not know.
Then on the Day of Resurrection He will disgrace them and proclaim, “Where are My partners, concerning whom you disputed”; the people of knowledge will say, “All disgrace and evil is upon the disbelievers this day.”
Those whose souls the angels remove whilst they were wronging themselves; so now they will plead “We never used to do any wrong”; "Yes you did, why not?
Indeed Allah well knows what you used to do."
“So now enter the gates of hell, remaining in it for ever”; so what an evil destination for the arrogant!
And it was said to the pious, “What has your Lord sent down?”
They said, “Goodness”; for those who did good in this world is goodness, and the final home is the best; and indeed what an excellent final home for the pious.
Everlasting Gardens of Eden which they will enter, beneath which rivers flow – in it they will get whatever they wish; this is how Allah rewards the pious.
Those whose souls the angels remove in a state of purity, saying, “Peace be upon you – enter Paradise, the reward of your deeds.”
So what are they waiting for, except that the angels come upon them or that your Lord’s punishment comes?
Those before them did exactly this; and Allah did not oppress them at all, but it is they who used to wrong themselves.
So the evils of their deeds struck them, and what they used to mock at surrounded them.
And the polytheists said, “Had Allah willed, we would not have worshipped anything besides Him – neither we nor our forefathers – and nor would we have forbidden anything, whilst being disassociated with Him”; those before them did exactly this; so what is (incumbent) upon the Noble Messengers, except to plainly convey (the message)?
And indeed We sent to every nation a Noble Messenger (proclaiming) that “Worship Allah and beware of the devil”; therefore Allah guided some of them, and error proved true upon some of them; therefore travel in the land and see what sort of fate befell the deniers!
If you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) desire for their guidance, then indeed Allah does not guide one whom He misleads, and they do not have any aides.
And they swore by Allah most vehemently in their oaths that, “Allah will not raise up the dead”; yes He will, why not?
A true promise obligatory upon Him, but most men do not know.
In order that He may make clear to them the matter in which they differed, and the disbelievers may realise that they were liars.
And Our command for anything to occur, when We will it, is that We only say to it, “Be” – and it thereupon happens.
And to those who migrated in Allah's cause after being oppressed, We shall indeed give them a good place in the world, and indeed the reward of the Hereafter is extremely great; if only the people knew!
Those who patiently endured and who rely only upon Allah.
And We did not send before you except men, towards whom We sent divine revelations – so O people, ask the people of knowledge if you do not know. (* All the Prophets were men.)
Along with clear proofs and writings; and We have sent down this Remembrance towards you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) so that you may explain to mankind what has been revealed towards them, and that they may ponder.
So do they who conspire evils, not fear that Allah may bury them in the earth, or that the punishment may come to them from a place they do not know?
Or that He may seize them while they move here and there, for they cannot escape?
Or that He may seize them whilst constantly ruining them?
For indeed your Lord is Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.
And have they not observed that the shadows of the things Allah has created incline to the right and to the left, in prostration to Allah, and that they are servile?
And to Allah only prostrates whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever moves in the earth, and the angels – and they are not proud.
They bear upon themselves the fear of their Lord, and do only what they are commanded.
And Allah has proclaimed, “Do not ascribe two Gods; indeed He is the only One God; therefore fear Me alone.”
And to Him only belongs all whatever is in the heavens and in the earth, and obeying Him only is obligatory; so will you fear anyone other than Allah?
And whatever blessings you have, are all from Allah – then whenever misfortune reaches you, towards Him only do you seek refuge.
And then, when He averts the misfortune from you, a group among you starts ascribing partners to their Lord!
In order to deny the favours We have given them; so enjoy a little; for you will soon come to know.
And for things unknown, they assign a portion of the sustenance We have given them; by Allah – you will certainly be questioned regarding all that you used to fabricate.
And they assign daughters to Allah – Purity is to Him! – and assign for themselves what they wish.
And when one among of them receives the glad tidings of a daughter, his face turns black for the day, and he remains seething.
Hiding from the people because of the evil of the tidings; “Will he keep her with disgrace, or bury her beneath the earth?”; pay heed!
Very evil is the judgement they impose!
Those who do not believe in the Hereafter, for them only is the evil state; and the Majesty of Allah is Supreme; and He only is the Most Honourable, the Wise.
Were Allah to seize people on account of their injustices, He would not have left anyone walking on the earth, but He gives them respite up to an appointed promise; then when their promise comes they cannot go back one moment nor come forward.
And they assign to Allah that which is abhorred by themselves, and their tongues speak the lies that goodness is for them; so it occurred that for them is the fire, and they have crossed the limits.
By Allah, We indeed sent Noble Messengers to several nations before you, but Satan made their misdeeds appear good to them – so he only is their companion this day, and for them is a punishment, most painful.
And We did not send down this Book towards you except for you to clearly explain to them the matters in which they may differ, and a guidance and a mercy for the believers.
And Allah sent down water from the sky and with it revived the earth after its death; indeed in this is a sign for people who keep ears*. (* That listen to the truth.)
And indeed in cattle is a lesson for you; We provide you drink from what is in their bellies – pure milk from between the excretion and the blood, palatable for the drinkers.
And from the fruits of date and grapes, for you make juices and good nourishment from them; indeed in this is a sign for people of intellect.
And your Lord inspired the bee that, “Build homes in hills, and in trees, and in rooftops.”
“Then eat from all kinds of fruits, and tread the ways of your Lord which are soft and easy for you”; from their bellies comes a drink of various colours, in which is health for mankind; indeed in this is a sign for people who ponder.
And Allah created you, and will then remove your souls; and among you is one who is sent back to the most lowly age, so knowing nothing after having had knowledge; indeed Allah knows everything, is Able to do all things.
And Allah has made some among you superior above others in livelihood; so those to whom the superiority is given, will not return their livelihood to their slaves, so they may all become equal in this respect; so do they deny the favours of Allah?
And Allah has created for you wives of your own breed, and has given you from your wives, sons and grandsons, and has provided sustenance for you from good things; so do they believe in falsehood and deny the favours of Allah?
And they worship such besides Allah, who do not have power to provide them any sustenance from the heavens or the earth, nor can they do anything.
Therefore do not ascribe equals to Allah; indeed Allah knows whereas you do not know.
Allah has illustrated an example – there is a slave, himself the property of another, not owning anything – and another one upon whom We have bestowed a good livelihood from Us, he therefore spends from it, secretly and publicly; will they be equal?
All praise is to Allah; in fact, most of them do not know.
And Allah has illustrated an example – two men – one of them dumb, unable to do anything, and he is a burden on his master – wherever his master sends him, he brings back no good; will he be equal to one who gives the command of justice and is on the Straight Path?
And for Allah only are the hidden things of the heavens and the earth, and the matter of Resurrection is not but like the batting of an eyelid – in fact closer than this; indeed Allah is Able to do all things.
And Allah brought you forth from your mothers’ wombs, whilst you did not know anything* – and gave you ears and eyes and hearts, for you to be grateful. (* Prophet Mohammed and Prophet Jesus, among others, are exceptions to this rule – peace and blessings be upon them.)
Have they not seen the birds, subservient in the open skies?
No one holds them up except Allah; indeed in this are signs for the people who believe.
And Allah has given you houses for staying, and made some houses from the hides of animals, which are easy for you on your day of travel and on the day of stopover – and from their wool, and fur, and hair, some household items and utilities for a while.
And Allah has provided you shade with the things He has created, and created for you refuge in the hills, and created some clothing for you to protect you from the heat, and some clothing to protect you during conflict; this is how He completes His favour upon you, so that you may obey.
Then if they turn away, O dear Prophet, (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) upon you is nothing but to clearly convey (the message).
They recognise the favour* of Allah and then deny it, and most of them are disbelievers. (* Prophet Mohammed (peace and blessings be upon him) and / or all the favours of Allah.)
And the day when We will raise up a witness from every nation – then there will be no leave for the disbelievers, nor will they be appeased.
And when the unjust will see the punishment, from that time on it will not be lightened for them, nor will they get respite.
And when the polytheists will see their ascribed partners, they will say, “Our Lord! These are our partners whom we used to worship besides You”; so they will strike back at them with the saying, “You are indeed liars!”
And on that day they will fall humbly before Allah, and they will lose all that they used to fabricate.
Those who disbelieved and prevented from the way of Allah – We added punishment upon the punishment – the recompense of their mischief.
And the day when We will raise from every group, a witness from among them, in order to testify against them and will bring you O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) as a witness upon them all; and We have sent down this Qur’an upon you which is a clear explanation of all things, and a guidance and a mercy and glad tidings to the Muslims.
Indeed Allah decrees the commands of justice and kindness, and of giving to relatives, and forbids from the shameful and evil and rebellion; He advises you so that you may pay heed.
And fulfil the covenant of Allah when you have made the promise, and do not break your oaths after ratifying them, and you have made Allah a Guarantor over you; indeed Allah knows your deeds.
And do not be like the woman broke her thread into bits after she had manufactured it; you make your oaths a phoney excuse between yourselves lest one nation may not be more than the other; Allah just tries you with it; and He will surely clarify for you on the Day of Resurrection, the matters in which you differed.
Had Allah willed He would have made you all one nation, but He sends astray whomever He wills and guides whomever He wills; and you will certainly be questioned regarding your deeds.
And do not make your oaths phoney excuses between yourselves, so that a foot may not slip after being steadfast and you may taste evil because you were preventing from Allah’s way; and lest you be severely punished.
And do not exchange the covenant of Allah to procure an abject price; that which is with Allah is better for you, if you know.
What you have will perish, and that which is with Allah will remain forever; and indeed We shall pay the patiently enduring a recompense which befits the best of their deeds.
Whoever does good deeds – whether a male or female – and is a Muslim, We shall sustain him an excellent life, and shall certainly pay them a recompense which befits the best of their deeds.
And when you recite the Qur’an, seek the refuge of Allah from Satan the outcast.
Indeed he has no power over the believers and who rely only upon their Lord.
Satan’s power is only over those who make friendship with him and ascribe him as a partner (in worship).
And when We replace a verse* by another – and Allah well knows what He sends down – the disbelievers say, “You are just fabricating”; in fact most of them do not know. (* The command of one verse by another.)
Proclaim, “The Holy Spirit* has rightly brought it down from your Lord, to make the believers steadfast, and a guidance and glad tidings for the Muslims.” (* Angel Jibreel – peace and blessings be upon him.)
And indeed We know that they say, “This Qur’an is being taught by some other man”; the one they refer to speaks a foreign language, whereas this is clear Arabic!
Those who disbelieve in the signs of Allah – Allah does not guide them, and for them is a punishment, most painful.
Only those who do not believe in Allah’s signs attribute lies and fabrications; and they themselves are liars.
The one who disbelieves in Allah after accepting faith – except him who is forced to and whose heart is still firmly upon faith – but whoever is wholeheartedly a disbeliever, upon them is the wrath of Allah; and for them is a great punishment.
This is because the worldly life was dearer to them than the Hereafter; and because Allah does not guide such disbelieving people.
These are the ones whose hearts, ears, and eyes Allah has sealed; and they are the neglectful.
So it occurred that they are the losers in the Hereafter.
Then indeed your Lord – for those who migrated after they had been oppressed, and then fought and remained patient – indeed your Lord is then, surely, Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
The day when every soul will come quarrelling against itself, and every soul will be fully repaid for what it did, and they will not be wronged.
And Allah has illustrated an example of a township – which dwelt in peace and security, its provisions coming in abundance from every side – in response the township started being ungrateful of Allah’s favours, therefore Allah made it taste the punishment by covering it with a cloak of starvation and fear, on account of their deeds.
And indeed a Noble Messenger came to them from among them – in response they denied him, and therefore the punishment seized them, and they were unjust.
Therefore eat the lawful and good sustenance Allah has provided you, and be grateful for the blessings of your Lord, if you worship Him.
Only these are forbidden for you – the carrion, and blood, and flesh of swine, and that which has been slaughtered while proclaiming the name of any other besides Allah; so one who is compelled and does not eat out of desire, nor more than what is necessary, then indeed Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
And do not say – the lie which your tongues speak – “This is lawful, and this is forbidden” in order to fabricate a lie against Allah; indeed those who fabricate lies against Allah will never prosper.
A little enjoyment – and for them is a punishment, most painful.
And especially for the Jews We forbade which We related to you earlier; and We did not oppress them, but it is they who wronged themselves.
Then indeed your Lord – for those who unwittingly commit evil and then repent and reform themselves – indeed your Lord is then, surely, Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
Indeed Ibrahim was a leader, obedient to Allah, and detached from all; and he was not a polytheist.
Grateful for His blessings; Allah chose him and guided him to the Straight Path.
And We gave him goodness in this world; and indeed in the Hereafter he is worthy of proximity.
And then We sent you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) the divine revelation that, “Follow the religion of Ibrahim, who was free from all falsehood; and was not a polytheist.”
The Sabbath was made obligatory only upon those who differed in it; and indeed your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning the matter in which they differed.
Call towards the path of your Lord with sound planning and good advice, and debate with them in the best possible way; indeed your Lord well knows him who has strayed from His path, and He well knows the guided.
And if you mete out punishment, then punish similarly as you were afflicted; and if you patiently endure, then indeed patience is better for the patiently enduring.
And O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) patiently endure – and your patience is only due to the guidance of Allah – and do not grieve for them, and do not be disheartened by their deceits.
Indeed Allah is with the pious and the virtuous.
Purity is to Him Who took His bondman in a part of the night from the Sacred Mosque to the Aqsa Mosque around which We have placed blessings, in order that We may show him Our great signs; indeed he is the listener, the beholder. (This verse refers to the physical journey of Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him – to Al Aqsa Mosque and from there to the heavens and beyond.
The entire journey back to Mecca was completed within a small part of the night.)
And We gave Moosa the Book, and made it a guidance for the Descendants of Israel that, “Do not appoint anyone as a Trustee besides Me.”
The descendants of those whom We boarded along with Nooh; he was indeed a grateful bondman.
And We decreed for the Descendants of Israel in the Book that, “You will indeed create great turmoil in the earth twice, and you will surely become very proud.”
So when the first of those promises came, We sent upon you Our extremely militant bondmen – they therefore entered the cities pursuing you; and this was a promise that had to be fulfilled.
We then reversed your attack upon them, and aided you with wealth and sons and increased your numbers.
If you do good deeds, you will for your own good – and if you commit evil, it is for yourself; therefore when the second of those promises came – so the enemy maim your faces, and enter the mosque as they had entered it the first time, and destroy until they ruin all they could capture.
It is likely that your Lord may have mercy on you; and if you repeat the mischief, We will repeat the punishment; and We have made hell a prison for the disbelievers.
Indeed this Qur’an guides to the most Straight Path, and gives glad tidings to the believers who do good deeds, that for them is a great reward.
And those who do not believe in the Hereafter – We have kept prepared for them a punishment, most painful.
And man prays for evil like the way he seeks goodness; and man is very hasty.
And We created the night and the day as two signs – We therefore kept the sign of the night indistinct, and the sign of the day visible – so that you may seek the munificence of your Lord, and know the calculation of the years, and the accounting; and We have explained all things in detail, distinctively.
And We have attached the destiny of every man to his neck; and We shall bring forth a register for him on the Day of Resurrection, which he will find open.
It will be said, “Read your ledger; this day you are sufficient to take your own account.”
Whoever came to guidance, has come for his own good; and whoever went astray, has strayed for his own ruin; and no burdened soul will bear another’s burden; and We never punish until We have sent a Noble Messenger.
And when We will to destroy a township We send the commands to its prosperous people, thereupon they do not obey them, and so the Word is proved upon it – We therefore destroy and ruin it.
And many a generation We did destroy after Nooh!
And Allah is Sufficient, Aware of the sins of His bondmen, the Beholder.
Whoever desires this fleeting one, We may give him quickly – whatever We will, to whomever We will; and then assign hell for him; for him to enter it condemned, pushed around.
And whoever desires the Hereafter and strives for it accordingly, and is a believer – so only their effort has borne fruit.
We provide help to all – to these and to those, by the bestowal of your Lord; and there is no constraint on the bestowal of your Lord.
Observe how We have given superiority to some over others; and indeed the Hereafter is the greatest in rank and the highest in excellence.
O listener, do not set up another God with Allah, for you will then remain seated condemned, helpless.
And your Lord has ordained that you do not worship anyone except Him, and treat your parents with kindness; if either of them or both reach old age in your presence, do not say “Uff”* to them and do not rebuff them, and speak to them with the utmost respect. (* Any expression of disgust.)
And lower your wing humbly for them, with mercy, and pray, “My Lord! Have mercy on them both, the way they nursed me when I was young.”
Your Lord is Well Aware of what is in your hearts; if you are worthy, then indeed He is Oft Forgiving for those who repent.
And give the relatives their rights, and to the needy, and to the traveller; and do not waste needlessly.
Indeed those who needlessly waste are brothers of the devils; and the devil is very ungrateful to his Lord.
And if you turn away from these*, expecting the mercy of your Lord, for which you hope, then speak to them an easy word. (* The companions of the Holy Prophet, who sought his assistance.)
And do not keep your hand tied to your neck nor open it completely, lest you remain seated – reproached, weary.
Indeed your Lord eases the livelihood and restricts it, for whomever He wills; He Well Knows, Beholds His bondmen.
And do not kill your children, fearing poverty; We shall provide sustenance to them as well as to you; indeed killing them is a great mistake.
And do not approach adultery – it is indeed a shameful deed; and a very evil way.
And do not wrongfully kill any living being which Allah has forbidden; and for whoever is slain wrongfully, We have given the authority to his heir, so he should not cross limits in slaying; he will surely be helped.
And do not approach the wealth of the orphan except in the best possible way, till he reaches adulthood; and fulfil the promise; indeed the promise will be asked about.
And correctly measure when you measure, and weigh correctly with the scales; this is better, and has a better outcome.
And do not pursue the matter you do not have the knowledge of; indeed the ear, and the eye, and the heart – each of these will be questioned.
And do not walk haughtily on the earth; you can never split the earth, nor be as high as the hills.
Of all this related before, the evil among it is disliked by your Lord.
This is part of the divine revelations of wisdom that your Lord has sent down to you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him); and O listener, do not set up another God with Allah, for you will then be thrown into hell – rebuked, rebuffed.
Has your Lord chosen sons for you, and created daughters for Himself from among the angels?
Indeed you utter a profound word!
And We have explained in this Qur’an in various ways, for them to understand; and it increases nothing except their hatred towards it.
Proclaim (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “If there were other Gods besides Him” – as they utter – “then they would have certainly found a way towards* the Owner of the Throne!”. (* To fight against Him.)
Purity and Supremacy are to Him from what they utter, a Great Supremacy!
The seven heavens and the earth and all those in them say His Purity; and there is not a thing that does not proclaim His purity with praise, but you do not understand their proclamation of purity; indeed He is Most Forbearing, Oft Forgiving.
And when you read the Qur’an O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings upon him), We created an invisible barrier between you and those who do not believe in the Hereafter.
And We placed covers upon their hearts so they may not understand it, and deafness in their ears; and when you mention your Only Lord in the Qur’an, they flee turning their backs in hatred.
We know well why they listen when they lend ears to you, and when they discuss among themselves, when the unjust say, “You have not followed except a man who is under a magic spell.”
See the kind of examples they invent for you! They therefore strayed, so cannot find a path.
And they say, “When we have become bones and decomposed, will we really be raised up anew?”
Proclaim, “Become stones or iron.”
“Or some other creation which you deem great”; so they will now say, “Who will create us again?”; proclaim, “He Who created you for the first time”; so now they will mockingly shake their heads at you, and question, “When is this going to occur?”; say, “It could perhaps be soon.”
“The day when He will call you and you will come praising Him, thinking you have stayed only a little.”
And tell My bondmen to speak that which is the best; undoubtedly Satan sows discord among them; indeed Satan is man’s open enemy.
Your Lord knows you well; if He wills He may have mercy upon you, or if He wills, He may punish you; and We have not sent you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) as a guardian over them.
And your Lord knows well all those who are in the heavens and the earth; and indeed among the Prophets We gave excellence to some above others, and We gave the Zaboor to Dawud.
Proclaim, “Call upon those whom you assume besides Allah – so they do not have any power to relieve the misfortune from you nor to avert it.”
The devoted bondmen whom these disbelievers worship, themselves seek the means of proximity from their Lord, that who among them is the closest (to his Lord), and hope for His mercy and fear His punishment; indeed the punishment of your Lord is to be feared.
And there is no such dwelling but which We shall destroy before the Day of Resurrection, or punish it severely; this is written in the Book.
And We remained constrained from sending such signs, because the former people denied them; and We gave the Thamud the she-camel for enlightenment, so they oppressed it; and We do not send such signs except to warn.
And when We proclaimed to you, “Indeed all mankind is within the control of your Lord”; and We did not create the spectacle* which We showed you except to try mankind, and the Tree** which is cursed in the Qur’an; and We warn them – so nothing increases for them except extreme rebellion. (* The Ascent of the Holy Prophet to the heavens and beyond, which the disbelievers denied as just a dream. ** The Zakkum tree which will grow in hell and be the food for its inhabitants.)
And recall when We ordered the angels that, “Prostrate before Adam” – so they all prostrated except Iblis; he said, “Shall I prostrate before one whom You have created from clay?”
He said, “Behold this* – the one whom You have honoured above me – if You give me respite till the Day of Resurrection, I will surely crush his descendants, except a few.” (* Prophet Adam.)
He said, “Be gone – therefore whoever among them follows you – so hell is the recompense for you all, a sufficient punishment.”
“And mislead those whom you can among them with your voice, and raise an army against them with your cavalry and infantry, and be their partner in wealth and children, and give them promises”; and Satan does not promise them except with deception.
“Indeed My bondmen* – you do not have any power over them”; and your Lord is Sufficient as a Trustee. (* The chosen virtuous bondmen)
Your Lord is He Who sails the ship upon the seas for you, so that you may seek His munificence; indeed He is Most Merciful upon you.
And when calamity strikes you upon the sea, all those whom you worship are lost, except Him; then when He rescues you towards land, you turn away; and man is extremely ungrateful.
Are you unafraid that He may bury an edge of the same land along with you, or send a shower of stones upon you, and you find no supporter for yourselves?
Or are you unafraid that He may again take you back to the sea, then send against you a ship-breaking gust of wind, therefore drowning you because of your disbelief – then you may not find for yourself anyone to come after Us for this?
Indeed We have honoured the Descendants of Adam and transported them over land and sea, and gave them good things as sustenance, and made them better than most of Our creation.
On the day when We shall summon every group along with its leader; so whoever is given his register in his right hand – these will read their accounts and their rights will not be suppressed even a thread. (* They will be given the full reward.)
Whoever is blind* in this life will be blind in the Hereafter, and even more astray. (* To the truth – disbelieving.)
And it was close that they were about to mislead you somewhat from the divine revelation We sent to you, for you to attribute something else* to Us; and if it were**, they would have accepted you as a friend. (* Other than the divine revelation. ** Which is impossible.)
And had We not kept you steadfast, possibly you might have inclined to them just a little.
And if it were*, We would then have made you taste a double life and a double death – you would then not find any supporter against Us. (* Which is impossible.)
And indeed it was close that they frighten you in the land for them to oust you from it – and if it were, they would not have stayed after you, but a little.
The tradition of the Noble Messengers We sent before you – and you will not find Our rules changing.
Keep the prayer established, from the declining of the sun until darkness of the night, and the Qur’an at dawn; indeed the angels witness the reading of the Qur’an at dawn.
And forego sleep* in some part of the night – an increase for you**; it is likely your Lord will set you on a place where everyone will praise you***. (* For worship. ** Obligatory only upon the Holy Prophet. *** On the Day of Resurrection.)
And pray, “My Lord! Admit me with the truth and take me out with the truth*, and give me from Yourself a helpful dominance**.” (* Wherever I come or go ** Through spread of Islam.)
And proclaim, “The Truth has arrived and falsehood has vanished; indeed falsehood had to vanish.” (* With the arrival of the Last Prophet – Mohammed peace and blessings be upon him)
And We send down in the Qur’an that which is a cure for the Muslims, and a mercy – and it increases only ruin for the unjust.
And when We bestow favours upon man, he turns away and goes far away towards himself; and when evil touches him he despairs.
Proclaim, “Each one works according to his own pattern; and your Lord well knows him who is more upon guidance.”
They ask you concerning the soul; proclaim “The soul is an entity by the command of my Lord, and you have not received knowledge except a little.”
And if We willed We could have taken away the revelations which We have sent to you – you would then not find anyone who could advocate for you before Us for this.
Except the mercy of your Lord; indeed His munificence upon you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) is extremely great.
Proclaim, “If all mankind and jinns agree to bring an equivalent to the Qur’an, they will not be able to bring its equal – even if they were to help each other.”
And indeed We have illustrated all kinds of examples in the Qur’an for mankind – so most men did not accept, except to be ungrateful.
And they said, “We will not accept faith in you, until you cause a spring to gush forth from the earth for us.”
“Or you have a garden of date-palms and grapes, and you make gushing rivers to flow in it.”
“Or you cause the sky to fall upon us in pieces like you said – or bring Allah and the angels as Witness.”
“Or you have a house of gold, or you ascend up into heaven; and even then we shall not believe in your ascent unless you send down a book upon us, which we may read”; say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “Purity is to my Lord – who am I except a human, sent by Allah?” (* These can be done, only when Allah commands.)
And what prevented people from believing when the guidance came to them, except their saying that, “What! Allah has sent a human as a Noble Messenger?”?
Proclaim, “If there were angels walking peacefully on the earth, We would send down only an angel from heaven, as a Noble Messenger towards them.”
Proclaim, “Allah is Sufficient as Witness between me and you all; indeed He is Well Aware of, the Beholder of His bondmen.”
And only he whom Allah guides, is upon guidance; and whomever He sends astray – you will therefore not find for them any supporters besides Him; and We shall raise them by their faces on the Day of Resurrection – blind, dumb and deaf; their destination is hell; whenever it is about to extinguish, We will inflame it more for them.
This is their reward because they disbelieved in Our signs and said, “When we are bones and decomposed, will we really be created again and raised up again?”
Do they not see that Allah Who has created the heavens and the earth is Able to create people similar to them, and has set a term for them in which there is no doubt?
So the unjust do not accept without being ungrateful.
Proclaim, “If you owned the treasures of the mercy of my Lord, you would hoard them too for fear that they may get spent; and man is a big miser.”
And indeed We gave Moosa nine clear signs, therefore ask the Descendants of Israel when he came to them – in response Firaun said, “O Moosa – I think you are under a magic spell.”
He said, “You certainly know that these have not been sent down except by the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the eye-openers* for the hearts; and I think that you, O Firaun, will surely be ruined.” (* The signs which enlighten the hearts.)
He therefore wished to expel them from the earth, so We drowned him and his companions, all together.
And after him, We said to the Descendants of Israel, “Reside in this land – then when the promise of the Hereafter comes, We will bring you all huddled together.”
And We sent down the Qur’an with the truth, and it has come down only for the truth; and We did not send you except as a Herald of glad tidings and warnings.
And We sent down the Qur’an in parts, that you may gradually recite it to the people, and We sent it down slowly in stages.
Proclaim, “Whether you accept faith in it or not”; indeed those who received knowledge before the Qur’an came, fall down prostrate on their faces when it is recited to them.
And they say, “Purity is to our Lord – indeed the promise of our Lord had to come true.”
And they fall down on their faces weeping, and this Qur’an increases their humility. (Command of prostration # 4).
Proclaim, “Pray calling (Him) Allah or calling (Him) the Most Gracious; whichever name you call with – they are all His magnificent names; and do not offer your prayers very loudly or very softly, and seek a way between them.”
And say, “All praise is to Allah, Who has not chosen a son for Himself, and none is His partner in kingship, and none is His supporter due to weakness, and say ‘Allah is Great’ to proclaim His greatness.”
All praise is to Allah Who sent down the Book upon His bondman, and has not kept any deviation in it.
A just Book, to warn of Allah’s severe punishment, and to give glad tidings to the believers who do good deeds, that for them is an excellent reward.
In which they will abide forever.
And to warn those who say “Allah has chosen a child.”
They do not have any knowledge of it – nor did their forefathers; profound is the word that comes out of their mouths; they only speak a lie.
Possibly you may risk your life by grieving (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) for them if they do not believe in this narration.
We have indeed placed all that is on the earth as its adornment in order that We may test them, who among them has the best deeds.
And indeed We shall one day make all that is on it a barren plain.
Did you know that the People of the Cave and People close to the Woods, were Our exceptional signs?
When the young men took refuge in the Cave – then said, “Our Lord! Give us mercy from Yourself, and arrange guidance for us in our affair.”
We then thumped upon their ears in the Cave for a number of years. (* Put them to sleep.)
We then awakened them to see which of the two groups more accurately tells the period they had stayed.
We shall narrate their account to you accurately; they were young men who believed in their Lord, and We increased the guidance for them.
And We made their hearts steadfast when they stood up and said, “Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth – we shall not worship any other deity except Him – if it were, we have then said something excessive.”
“These – the people of ours – have set up Gods besides Allah; why do they not bring a clear proof regarding them?
And who is more unjust than one who fabricates a lie against Allah?”
“And when you have disassociated yourself from them and all what they worship besides Allah – so take refuge in the Cave – your Lord will spread His mercy for you and arrange ease for you in your affairs.”
And O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) you will see the sun that when it rises it shifts away to the right of their cave, and when it sets it shifts away to their left, and they are in the open ground of that cave; this is from among the signs of Allah; whomever Allah guides – only he is therefore guided; and whomever He sends astray – you will never find for him a friend who guides.
And you may think they are awake, whereas they are asleep; and We turn them over to the right and the left – and their dog is on the threshold of the cave, with its paws outstretched; O listener, were you to look at them closely, you would turn back running away from them, and be filled with their dread.
And similarly We awakened them so that they may enquire about each other; a speaker among them said, “How long have you stayed here?” Some among them said, “We have stayed a day or part of a day”; the others said, “Your Lord well knows how long you have stayed; therefore send one of you to the city with this silver coin – he may then check which food available there is purer, in order to bring some of it for you to eat – and he must be courteous and not inform anyone about you.”
“Indeed if they come to know about you, they will stone you or turn you back to their religion – and if so, you will never prosper.”
And this is how We made them known for people to know that the promise of Allah is true and that there is no doubt concerning the Last Day; when the people began disputing among themselves regarding them, they said, “Construct a building over their cave”; their Lord well knows them; those who dominated in this matter said, “We promise we will build a mosque over them.”
So the people will now say, “They are three, their dog is the fourth”; and some will say, “They are five, their dog is the sixth” – just blind guesses; and some will say, “They are seven, and their dog is the eighth”; proclaim (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “My Lord well knows their number – no one knows them except a few”; therefore do not debate concerning them except what has occurred, and do not ask any of the People of the Book(s) anything concerning them.
And never say about anything that, “I will do this tomorrow.”
Except “If Allah wills”; and remember your Lord when you forget, and say, “It is likely that my Lord will guide me to a more accurate way of virtue than this.”
And they stayed in their Cave for three hundred years* and nine more*. (* 300 according to the Solar calendar and 309 according to the Lunar calendar.)
Say, “Allah well knows how long they stayed; for Him only are the hidden of the heavens and the earth; how well He sees and hears! They do not have any supporter besides Him; and He does not associate anyone in His command.”
And recite the Book of your Lord which has been divinely revealed to you; there is none who can change His Words; and you will never find a refuge besides Him.
And restrain yourself along with those who pray to their Lord morning and evening, seeking His pleasure; and may not your sight fall on anything besides them; would you desire the adornment of the life of this world? And do not follow him whose heart We have made neglectful of Our remembrance – the one who has followed his own desires and his matter has crossed the limits.
And proclaim, “The Truth is from your Lord”; so whoever wills may accept faith, and whoever wills may disbelieve – We have indeed prepared for the disbelievers a fire the walls of which will surround them; if they plead for water, their plea will be answered with water like molten metal which shall scald their faces; what an evil drink it is; and what an evil destination is hell!
Indeed those who believed and did good deeds – We do not waste the reward of those whose deeds are good.
For them are everlasting Gardens of Eden, beneath which rivers flow – in it they will be given bracelets of gold to adorn, and shall wear green clothes made of fine silk and gold embroidery, reclining upon thrones in it; what an excellent reward; and what an excellent abode is Paradise!
And relate to them the account of the two men – to one We gave two gardens of grapes, and covered them with date-palms and kept farms between them.
Both the gardens gave yields and gave no shortfall in it – and We made a river to flow between the two.
And he had fruit; he therefore said to his companion – and he used to debate with him – “I exceed you in wealth, and am more powerful in respect of men.”
He went into his garden and wronging himself said, “I do not think that this will ever perish.”
“I do not think that the Last Day will ever be established – and even if I return to my Lord I will surely find a haven better than this garden.”
His companion debating with him answered, “What! You disbelieve in Him Who has created you from dust, then from a drop of liquid, and then created you as a complete man?”
“But I just say that only Allah is my Lord, and I do not ascribe anyone as a partner to my Lord.”
“And why was it not that you would have said when you entered your garden, ‘Whatever Allah wills – we do not have any strength except with the help of Allah’ – if you had observed me lesser than you in wealth and children.”?
“So it is likely that my Lord will give me a garden better than yours, and send bolts of lightning from the skies on your garden – it therefore turns into a barren plain.”
“Or its water may sink into the earth, so you may never be able to find it.”
And his fruits were surrounded – he therefore remained helplessly wringing his hands upon all that he had spent on it – and it lay fallen on its canopy – and he says, “If only I had not ascribed any partner to my Lord!”
And he had no group to help him against Allah, nor was he capable of taking revenge.
Here brought to light is that the authority is only for Allah, the True; the reward He bestows is the best, and believing in Him has the best outcome.
And relate to them the example of the life of this world – like water which We sent down from the sky, therefore vegetation of the earth grew forth in abundance with it to become dry hay which the winds scatter; and Allah is the Controller of all things.
Wealth and sons are ornaments of the life of this world; and good deeds that last – their reward is better before your Lord, and are better in respect of hope.
And the Day when We move the hills and you see the earth flattened plain, and We shall raise all of them together – so not leaving out any one of them.
And everyone shall be presented before your Lord in rows; “Indeed you have come to Us exactly as We had created you for the first time – in fact you thought that We shall never appoint a promised time for you!”
And the Book shall be placed – and you will see the guilty dreading what is written in it and saying, “Woe to us – what sort of a Book is this that it has not left out any small sin nor a great one, which it has not included!”
And they found all that they did confronting them; and your Lord does not wrong any one.
And recall when We commanded the angels that, “Prostrate before Adam” – so they all prostrated, except Iblis; he was of the jinn, he therefore rebelled against his Lord’s command; “What!
You choose him and his offspring as your friends instead of Me, whereas they are your enemies?”
And what an evil alternative did the unjust get.
Neither did I make them witness the creations of the heavens and the earth, nor witness their own creation; nor does it befit My Majesty to choose misleaders as aides.
And the Day when He will proclaim, “Call those partners of Mine whom you had assumed” – so they will call out to them – they will not answer them, and We shall create a field of destruction between them.
And when the guilty see hell, they will be certain of falling into it, and will find no place to escape from it.
And We have indeed illustrated all kinds of examples for mankind in this Qur’an; and man is the most quarrelsome of all.
And what prevented men from accepting faith when guidance came to them, and from asking forgiveness from their Lord except that the tradition of the former nations come upon them or that they confront various kinds of punishments?
And We do not send the Noble Messengers except as Heralds of glad tidings and warnings; and the disbelievers debate by means of falsehood to drive away the Truth with it, and they took My signs and warnings they were given, as a mockery!
And who is more unjust than one who, when reminded of the signs of his Lord, turns away from them and forgets what his hands have sent forward?
We have put covers on their hearts so as not to understand the Qur’an, and deafness in their ears; and even if you call them to guidance, they will never attain the right path.
And your Lord is the Oft Forgiver, the Merciful; if He seized them for their deeds, He would soon send the punishment upon them; but for them is an appointed time from which they will not find any refuge.
And these towns – We destroyed them when they committed injustice, and We had set an appointed time for their destruction.
And recall when Moosa said to his assistant, “I will not give up until I reach the place where the two seas meet or until I have progressed for ages.”
And when they reached the place where the two seas meet, they forgot about their fish, and it took its way into the sea, making a tunnel. (The dead fish came alive and went into the water.)
So when they had gone beyond that place, Moosa said to his assistant, “Bring our breakfast – we have indeed faced great exertion in this journey of ours.”
He said, “Just imagine – when we had taken shelter near the rock, so indeed I forgot the fish; and none but Satan caused me to forget to mention it; and the fish took its way into the sea – its amazing!”
Said Moosa, “This is exactly what we wanted”; so they came back retracing their steps.
So they found a bondman* from amongst Our (chosen) bondmen, to whom We had given mercy from Us, and had bestowed the inspired knowledge from Ourselves. (* Hazrat Khidr – peace be upon him.)
Moosa said to him, “May I stay with you upon the condition that you will teach me the righteousness that you have been taught?”
He said, “You will never be able to patiently stay with me.”
“And how will you bear something which your knowledge does not encompass?”
Said Moosa, “Allah willing, you will soon find me patient and I will not do anything against your instructions.”
He said, “Therefore if you stay with me, do not ask me about anything until I myself mention it to you.”
So they both set out; until when they had boarded the boat, the chosen bondman ruptured the boat; said Moosa, “Did you make a hole in the boat in order to drown its passengers?
You have indeed done an evil thing.”
He said, “Did I not say that you will never be able to patiently stay with me?”
Said Moosa, “Do not apprehend me upon my forgetting, and do not impose difficulty on me in my task.”
So they set out again; until when they met a boy, the chosen bondman slew him – Moosa said, “Did you slay an innocent soul not in retribution for another?
You have indeed done an extremely evil thing.”
He said, “Did I not tell you that you will never be able to patiently stay with me?”
Said Moosa, “If I ask you anything after this, do not stay with me; indeed your condition from me is fulfilled.”
So they both set out again; until they came to the people of a dwelling – they asked its people for food – they refused to invite them – then in the village they both found a wall about to collapse, and the chosen bondman straightened it; said Moosa, “If you wished, you could have taken some wages for it!”
He said, “This is the parting between you and me; I shall now tell you the interpretation of the matters you could not patiently bear.”
“In respect of the boat – it belonged to the poor people who worked on the river, so I wished to flaw it – and behind them was a king who would capture every sound ship.”
“And in respect of the boy – his parents were Muslims and we feared that he may incite them to rebellion and disbelief.”
“So we wished that their Lord may bestow them a child – better, purer and nearer to mercy.”
“And in respect of the wall – it belonged to two orphan boys of the city, and beneath it was their treasure, and their father was a virtuous man; therefore your Lord willed that they should reach their maturity and remove their treasure; by the mercy of your Lord; and I have not done this at my own command; this is the interpretation of the matters you could not patiently bear.” (* Hazrat Khidr was given the knowledge of the hidden – as in all three explanations he gave).
And they ask you regarding Zul-Qarnain; say, “I shall recite his story to you.”
Indeed We gave him authority in the land and bestowed him the means of everything.
He therefore pursued a purpose.
To the extent that when he reached the setting-place of the sun, he found it setting in a muddy spring, and found a nation there; We said, “O Zul-Qarnain – either punish them or choose kindness for them.”
He submitted, “Regarding one who has done injustice, we shall soon punish him – he will then be brought back to his Lord, Who will punish him severely.”
“And regarding one who believed and did good deeds – so his reward is goodness; and we shall soon give him an easy command.”
He again pursued a purpose.
To the extent that when he reached the rising-place of the sun, he found it rising upon a nation for which We had not kept any shelter from it.
So it is; and Our knowledge encompasses all that he possessed.
He again pursued a purpose.
Until, when he came between two mountains, he found before them a nation that did not appear to understand any speech.
They said, “O Zul-Qarnain – indeed Yajuj and Majuj* are spreading chaos in the land – so shall we assign for you a consideration upon the condition that you set up a wall between us and them?” (* Gog and Magog.)
He said, “That which my Lord has given me control over is better, therefore help me with strength – I shall set up a barrier between you and them.”
“Give me sheets of iron”; until when he had raised the wall equal to the edge of the two mountains, he said, “Blow”; to the extent that he made it ablaze – he said, “Bring me molten copper to pour upon it.”
Therefore Yajuj and Majuj were neither able to surmount it, nor could they pierce it.
He said, “This is the mercy of my Lord; then when the promise of my Lord arrives, He will blow it to bits; and my Lord’s promise is true.”
And on that day We shall release them in groups surging like waves one after another, and the Trumpet will be blown – so We shall gather them all together. (* Gog and Magog will come out during the time of Eisa (Jesus – when he comes back to earth) and cause great destruction in the land.)
And We shall bring hell in front of the disbelievers.
The ones whose eyes were covered from My remembrance, and who could not bear to hear Truth.
Do the disbelievers assume that they will be able to choose My bondmen as supporters other than Me?
Indeed We have prepared hell to welcome the disbelievers.
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “Shall we inform you whose are the most failed works?”
“Of those whose efforts are lost in (pursuit of) the life of this world, and they think that they are doing good deeds.”
The people who disbelieved in the signs of their Lord and in the meeting with Him, therefore all their deeds are in vain –We shall therefore not establish any weighing for them on the Day of Resurrection.
This is their reward – hell – because they disbelieved, and made a mockery of My verses and My Noble Messengers.
Indeed those who believed and did good deeds – their welcome are the Gardens of Paradise.
They will abide in it for ever, never wanting to shift from it.
Proclaim, “If the sea became ink for the Words of my Lord, the sea would indeed be used up and the Words of my Lord would never – even if we bring another like it for help.”
Proclaim, “Physically I am a human* like you – my Lord sends divine revelations to me – that your God is only One God; so whoever expects to the meet his Lord must perform good deeds and not ascribe anyone as a partner in the worship of his Lord.” (* Human but not equal to you, in fact the greatest in spiritual status.)
Kaf-Ha-Ya-A’in-Sad. (* Alphabets of the Arabic language – Allah and to whomever He reveals know their precise meanings.)
This is the remembrance of the mercy of your Lord upon His bondman Zakaria.
When he softly prayed to his Lord.
He submitted, “O my Lord – my bones have become weak and old age shines forth from my head, and O my Lord, I have never been disappointed in my prayer to you.”
“And I fear my relatives after me and my wife is barren therefore bestow upon me from Yourself one who will take up my work.”
“He being my successor and the heir of the Descendants of Yaqub (Jacob); and my Lord, make him a cherished* one.” (* Make him a Prophet among the Descendants of Israel.)
“O Zakaria! We give you the glad tidings of a son whose name is Yahya (John) – before him, We have not created anyone of this name.”
He submitted, “My Lord – how can I have a son whereas my wife is barren and I have reached infirmity due to old age?”
He (the angel) said, “So it is; your Lord says, ‘This is easy for Me – in fact I created you before this, at a time when you did not exist.’”
He said, “My Lord, give me a sign”; He said, “Your token is that you will not speak to people for three nights, although in proper health.”
He therefore emerged upon his people from the mosque, and told them through gestures, “Keep proclaiming the Purity (of your Lord) morning and evening.”
“O Yahya – hold the Book firmly”; and We gave him Prophethood in his infancy.
(Prophet Yahya was only 2 years old at that time.)
And compassion from Ourselves, and chastity; and he was extremely pious.
And was good to his parents and not forceful, nor disobedient.
And peace is upon him the day he was born, and the day he will taste death, and the day he will be raised alive.
And remember Maryam in the Book; when she went away from her family to a place towards east.
So there she screened herself from them; We therefore sent Our Spirit towards her – he appeared before her in the form of a healthy man. (Angel Jibreel – peace be upon him.)
She said, “I seek the refuge of the Most Gracious from you – if you fear God.”
He said, “I am indeed one sent by your Lord; so that I may give you a chaste son.”
She said, “How can I bear a son? No man has ever touched me, nor am I of poor conduct!”
He said, “So it is; your Lord has said, ‘This is easy for Me’; and in order that We make him a sign for mankind and a Mercy from Us; and this matter has been decreed.”
So she conceived him, and she went away with him to a far place.
Then the pangs of childbirth brought her to the base of the palm-tree; she said, “Oh, if only had I died before this and had become forgotten, unremembered.”
(The angel) Therefore called her from below her, “Do not grieve – your Lord has made a river flow below you.”
“And shake the trunk of the palm-tree towards you – ripe fresh dates will fall upon you.” (This was a miracle – the date palm was dry and it was winter season.)
“Therefore eat and drink and appease your eyes; so if you meet any person then say, ‘I have pledged a fast (of silence) to the Most Gracious – I will therefore not speak to any person today.’”
So carrying him in her arms, she brought him to her people; they said, “O Maryam, you have indeed committed a great evil!”
“O sister of Haroon, neither was your father an evil man nor was your mother of poor conduct!”
Thereupon she pointed towards the child; they said, “How can we speak to an infant who is in the cradle?”
The child proclaimed, “I am Allah’s bondman; He has given me the Book and made me a Herald of the Hidden (a Prophet).”
“And He has made me blessed wherever I be; and ordained upon me prayer and charity, as long as I live.”
“And has made me good to my mother and not made me forceful, ill-fated.”
“And peace is upon me the day I was born, and on the day I shall taste death, and on the day I will be raised alive.”
This is Eisa (Jesus), the son of Maryam; a true statement, in which they doubt.
It does not befit Allah to appoint someone as His son – Purity is to Him!
When He ordains a matter, He just commands it, “Be” – and it thereupon happens.
And said Eisa, “Indeed Allah is my Lord and your Lord – therefore worship Him; this is the Straight Path.”
Then groups among them differed; so ruin is for the disbelievers from the witnessing of a Great Day.
Much will they listen and much will they see, on the Day when they come to Us, but today the unjust are in open error.
And warn them of the Day of Regret when the matter will have been decided; and they are in neglect, and they do not accept faith.
Indeed We shall inherit the earth and all that is on it, and only towards Us will they return.
And remember Ibrahim in the Book; he was very truthful, a Herald of the Hidden (a Prophet).
When he said to his father,* “O my father – why do you worship one which neither hears nor sees, and cannot benefit you in any way?” (* His uncle Azar.)
“O my father, indeed a knowledge has come to me which did not come to you – therefore follow me, I will show you the Straight Path.”
“O my father, do not be a bondman of the devil; indeed the devil is disobedient towards the Most Gracious.”
“O my father, I fear that a punishment from the Most Gracious may reach you, so you would become a companion of the devil.”
He said, “What! You turn away from my Gods, O Ibrahim?
If you do not desist, I will certainly stone you, and keep no relation with me for a long while.”
He said, “Stop it – peace be upon you; I shall seek forgiveness for you from my Lord; indeed He is very kind to me.”
"And I shall remain separated from you and all that you worship other than Allah and shall worship my Lord; possibly, by worshipping my Lord, I will not be amongst the unfortunate.”
So when he had separated from them and what they worshipped other than Allah, We bestowed him Ishaq and Yaqub; and We made each of them a Herald of the Hidden.
And We gave them Our mercy, and assigned for them a true and high repute.
And remember Moosa in the Book; he was indeed a chosen one, and he was a Noble Messenger, a Herald of the Hidden.
We called him from the right side of the mountain Tur, and brought him close to reveal Our secret.
And with Our mercy We bestowed upon him his brother Haroon, a Prophet.
And remember Ismail in the Book; he was indeed true to his promise and was a Noble Messenger, a Prophet.
He used to command his people to offer prayer and give charity, and was liked by his Lord.
And remember Idrees in the Book; he was indeed very truthful, a Prophet.
And We lifted him to a high position. (Living with soul & body in heaven, after his death.)
It is these upon whom Allah has bestowed favour among the Prophets, from the descendants of Adam; and from those whom We boarded along with Nooh; and from the descendants of Ibrahim and Israel; and from those whom We guided and chose; when the verses of the Most Gracious were recited to them, they fell down, prostrating and weeping. (* Command of Prostration # 5.)
And after them came the unworthy successors who squandered prayer and pursued their own desires, so they will soon encounter the forest of Gai in hell.
Except those who repented and accepted faith and did good deeds – so these will enter heaven, and they will not be deprived* in the least. (* Of their due reward.)
Everlasting Gardens of Eden, which the Most Gracious has promised to His bondmen in the unseen; indeed His promise will come.
They will not hear any lewd talk in it, but only Peace; and in it for them is sustenance, every morning and evening.
It is the Paradise that We will bequeath to those among Our bondmen who remain pious.
(Said Angel Jibreel to Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon them) “And we angels do not come down except by the command of your Lord; to Him only belongs all that is ahead of us and all that is behind us and all that is between them; and your Lord is not forgetful.”
Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them – therefore worship Him and be firm in His worship; do you know any other of the same name as His?
And says man, “When I am dead, will I soon be brought forth alive?”
Does not man remember that We created him before this, and he was non existent?
So by your Lord, We shall assemble them and the devils – all of them – and bring them around hell, fallen on their knees.
We shall then pick out from every group the one who was most arrogant towards the Most Gracious.
Moreover, We well know those who most deserve to be burned in hell.
And there is none among you who shall not pass over hell; this is an obligatory affair, binding upon your Lord. (Allah will make everyone pass over the back of hell – on a thin bridge.)
We shall then rescue the pious – and leave the unjust in it, fallen on their knees.
And when Our clear verses are recited to them, the disbelievers say to the Muslims, “Which group has a better home, and a better alliance?”
And many a generation We did destroy before them, who exceeded them in wealth and pomp!
Proclaim, “For one in error – so the Most Gracious may give him respite; to the extent that when they see the thing which they are promised – either the punishment or the Last Day; so then they will come to know for whom is the evil rank and whose army is weak.”
And Allah will increase the guidance for those who have received guidance; and good deeds that remain have the best reward before your Lord, and the best outcome.
So have you seen him who denied Our signs and says, “I shall certainly be given wealth and children?”
Has he seen the Hidden, or has he made a pact with the Most Gracious?
Never; We shall now record what he says and give him a prolonged punishment.
And it is We only Who shall inherit what he says (belongs to him), and he will come to Us, alone.
And they have chosen Gods besides Allah, so that they may provide them strength!
Never; soon they will deny ever worshipping them, and will turn into their opponents.
Did you not see that We sent devils upon the disbelievers, so they excite them abundantly?
So do not be impatient for them (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him); We are only completing their number.* (* The number of days left for them or their evil deeds.)
On the day when We shall assemble the righteous towards the Most Gracious, as guests.
And drive the guilty towards hell, thirsty.
People do not own the right to intercede, except those* who have made a covenant with the Most Gracious. (* The Holy Prophets and virtuous people will be given the permission to intercede. Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him – will be the first to intercede.)
And the disbelievers said, “The Most Gracious has chosen an offspring.”
You have indeed brought an extremely grave speech!
The heavens are close to being torn apart by it, and the earth being split asunder, and the mountains succumbing and falling down.
Due to their ascribing of an offspring to the Most Gracious.
And it does not befit the Most Gracious to choose an offspring!
All those who are in the heavens and the earth will come to the Most Gracious as His bondmen.
He knows their number and has counted each one of them.
And each one of them will come before Him on the Day of Resurrection, alone.
Indeed those who believed and did good deeds – the Most Gracious will appoint love for them. (In the hearts of other believers.)
We have therefore made this Qur’an easy upon your tongue, (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) for you to announce glad tidings with it to those who fear, and warn those who are quarrelsome.
And many a generation We did destroy before them; do you see any one of them or hear their faintest sound?
Ta-Ha.* (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) (Alphabets of the Arabic language – Allah and to whomever He reveals know their precise meanings.)
We have not sent down this Qur’an upon you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) for you to fall into hardship! (Either because he used to pray at length during the night or because he was distressed due to the disbelievers not accepting faith.)
Except as a reminder for one who fears.
Sent down by One Who created the earth and the lofty heavens.
The Most Gracious Who, befitting His Majesty, took to the Throne (of control).
To Him only belongs all whatever is in the heavens and all whatever is in the earth, and all whatever is between them, and all whatever is beneath this wet soil.
And if you speak aloud – so He surely knows the secret and that which is more concealed.
Allah – there is no worship except for Him; His only are the best names.
And did the news of Moosa reach you?
When he saw a fire and said to his wife, “Wait – I have seen a fire – perhaps I may bring you an ember from it or find a way upon the fire.”
So when he came near the fire, it was announced, “O Moosa!”
“Indeed I am your Lord, therefore take off your shoes; indeed you are in the holy valley of Tuwa!”
“And I have chosen you, therefore listen carefully to what is divinely revealed to you.”
“Indeed it is Me, Allah – there is no God except I – therefore worship Me and keep the prayer established for My remembrance.”
“The Last Day will surely come – it was close that I hide it from all – in order that every soul may get the reward of its effort.”
(He revealed it to His Prophets, so that people may fear and get ready. The exact time is not revealed to the people.)
“Therefore never let one, who does not accept faith in it and follows his own desires, prevent you from accepting this, so then you become ruined.”
“And what is this in your right hand, O Moosa?”
He said, “This is my staff; I support myself on it, and I knock down leaves for my sheep with it, and there are other uses for me in it.”
He said, “Put it down, O Moosa!
So Moosa put it down – thereupon it became a fast moving serpent.
He said, “Pick it up and do not fear; We shall restore it to its former state.”
“And put your hand inside your armpit – it will come out shining white, not due to any illness – one more sign.”
“In order that We may show you Our great signs.”
“Go to Firaun, he has rebelled.”
Said Moosa, “My Lord, open up my breast for me.”
“And make my task easy for me.”
“And untie the knot of my tongue.”
“In order that they may understand my speech.”
“And appoint for me a viceroy from among my family.”
“That is Haroon, my brother.”
“Back me up with him.”
“And make him a partner in my task.”
“In order that we may profusely proclaim Your Purity.”
“And profusely remember You.”
“Indeed You see us.”
He said, “O Moosa, you have been granted your prayer.”
“And indeed We had bestowed upon you a favour one more time.”
“When We inspired in your mother’s heart whatever was to be inspired.”
“That, ‘Put him into a chest and cast it into the river, so the river shall deposit it on to a shore – therefore one who is an enemy to Me and you, shall pick him up’; and I bestowed upon you love from Myself; and for you to be brought up in My sight.”
“When your sister went, then said, ‘Shall I show you the people who may nurse him?’ And We brought you back to your mother in order to soothe her eyes and that she may not grieve; and you killed a man, so We freed you from sorrow, and tested you to the maximum; you therefore stayed for several years among the people of Madyan; then you came (here) at an appointed time, O Moosa.”
“And I created you especially for Myself.”
“You and your brother, both go with My signs, and do not slacken in My remembrance.”
“Both of you go to Firaun; he has indeed rebelled.”
“And speak to him courteously, that perhaps he may ponder or have some fear.”
They both submitted, “Our Lord – indeed we fear that he may oppress us or deal mischievously.”
He said, “Do not fear – I am with you, All Hearing and All Seeing.”
“Therefore go to him and say, ‘We are the sent ones of your Lord, therefore let the Descendants of Israel go with us, and do not trouble them; we have indeed brought to you a sign from your Lord; and peace be upon him who follows the guidance.’
‘It has indeed been revealed to us that the punishment is upon the one who denies and turns away.’”
Said Firaun, “So who is the Lord of you both, O Moosa?”
He said, “Our Lord is One Who gave everything its proper shape, then showed the path.”
Said Firaun, “What is the state of the former generations?”
He said, “Their knowledge is with my Lord, (recorded) in a Book; my Lord neither strays nor forgets.”
The One Who has made the earth a bed for you and kept operative roads for you in it and sent down water from the sky; so with it We produced different pairs of vegetation.
Eat, and graze your cattle; indeed in this are signs for people of intellect.
From the earth We have created you, and to it We shall return you, and from it We shall raise you again.
And indeed We showed him all Our signs – so he denied them and did not accept.
He said, “Have you come to us in order to expel us from our land by your magic, O Moosa?”
“So we will also produce before you a similar magic, therefore set up an agreed time between us and you, from which neither we nor you shall turn away, at a level place.”
Said Moosa, “Your meeting is the day of the festival, and that the people be assembled at late morning.”
So Firaun went away and gathered his schemes,* then came. (* 72000 magicians and their materials.)
Moosa said to them, “Ruin is to you – do not fabricate a lie against Allah, that He may destroy you by a punishment; and indeed one who fabricates lies has failed.”
So they differed with one another in their task, and secretly conferred.
They said, “Undoubtedly these two are magicians for sure, who wish to expel you from your land by the strength of their magic, and destroy your exemplary religion!”
“Therefore strengthen your scheme, and come forth in rows; indeed whoever dominates this day has succeeded.”
They said, “O Moosa, either you throw first – or shall we throw first?”
He said, “Rather, you may throw”; thereupon their cords and their staves, by the strength of their magic, appeared to him as if they were (serpents) moving fast.
And Moosa sensed fear in his heart.
We said, “Do not fear – it is you who is dominant.”
“And cast down which is in your right hand – it will devour all that they have fabricated; what they have made is only a magician’s deceit; and a magician is never successful, wherever he comes.”
Therefore all the magicians were thrown down prostrate – they said, “We accept faith in the One Who is the Lord of Haroon and Moosa.”
Said Firaun, “You accepted faith in him before I permitted you!
He is indeed your leader who taught you magic; I therefore swear, I will cut off your hands and your legs from alternate sides, and crucify you on the trunks of palm-trees, and you will surely come to know among us two, whose punishment is more severe and more lasting.”
They said, “We shall never prefer you above the clear proofs that have come to us from the One Who has created us – therefore carry out what you want to; only in the life of this world will you be able to!”
“Indeed we have accepted faith in our Lord, so that He may forgive us our sins and the magic which you forced us to perform; and Allah is Better, and the Most Lasting.”
Indeed the one who comes guilty to his Lord – so undoubtedly for him is hell; neither dying nor living in it.
And the one who presents himself as a believer before Him, having done good deeds – so for them are the high ranks.
Everlasting Gardens of Eden beneath which rivers flow, abiding in them for ever; and this is the reward of one who became pure.
And We divinely inspired Moosa that, “Journey with My bondmen in a part of the night and strike a dry path in the sea for them, you shall have no fear of Firaun getting to you, nor any danger.”
So Firaun went after them with his army – therefore the sea enveloped them, the way it did.
And Firaun led his people astray, and did not guide them.
O Descendants of Israel, indeed We rescued you from your enemy, and We made a covenant with you on the right side of Mount Tur, and sent down Manna and Salwa upon you.
“Eat the good clean things We have provided you, and do not exceed the limits in respect of it causing My wrath to descend upon you; and indeed the one on whom My wrath descended, has fallen.”
And indeed I am Most Oft Forgiving for him who repented and accepted faith and did good deeds, and then remained upon guidance.
“And why did you come in haste ahead of your people, O Moosa?”
He submitted, “They are here, just behind me – and O my Lord, I hastened towards You, in order to please You.”
He said, “We have therefore tried your people after you came, and Samri has led them astray.”
So Moosa turned back to his people, angry and grieving; he said, “O my people, had not your Lord given you a good promise?
Did a long time pass away for you, or did you wish that your Lord’s wrath come upon you, therefore you broke your promise with me?”
They said, “We did not renege on our promise to you on our own will, but we were made to carry the burdens of ornaments of the people, so we cast them – and similarly did Samri cast.”
He therefore made a calf for them – a lifeless body, making sounds like a cow – so they said, “This is your God and the God of Moosa; whereas Moosa has forgotten.”
So do they not see that it does not answer to any of their speech? And has no power to cause them any harm or benefit?
And undoubtedly Haroon had told them before it that, “O my people – you have needlessly fallen into trial because of this; and indeed your Lord is the Most Gracious, therefore follow me and obey my command.”
They said, “We will continue to squat* before it, till Moosa returns to us.” (* Continue worshipping it.)
Said Moosa, “O Haroon – what prevented you when you saw them going astray?”
“That you did not come after me?
So did you disobey my order?”
He said, “O son of my mother, do not clutch my beard nor the hair on my head; I feared that you may say, ‘You have caused a division among the Descendants of Israel and did not wait for my advice.’”
Said Moosa, “And what is your explanation, O Samri?”
He said, “I witnessed what the people did not witness – I therefore took a handful from the tracks* of the angel, then threw it** – and this is what seemed pleasing to my soul.” (* The marks left behind by the mount of Angel Jibreel. ** Into the mouth of the calf.)
Said Moosa, “Therefore go away, for in this life your punishment is that you exclaim ‘Do not touch!’* And indeed for you is a time appointed, which you cannot break; and look at your deity, in front of which you remained squatting the whole day; we swear we will surely burn it and, smashing it into bits, discharge it into the river.” (* He was cursed with a disease.)
“Your God is only Allah – other than for Whom there is no worship; His knowledge encompasses all things.”
This is how We relate the former tidings to you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him); and We have given you a Remembrance* from Ourselves. (*The Holy Qur’an.)
Whoever turns away from it, will bear a burden on the Day of Resurrection.
They will remain in it forever – what an evil burden it will be for them on the Day of Resurrection!
On the day when the Trumpet is blown and We shall assemble the guilty on that day, blue -eyed.
Whispering secretly among themselves, “You have not stayed on earth but for ten days.”
We know well what they will utter, whereas the wisest among them will say, “You have stayed just for a day.”
They ask you regarding the mountains; proclaim, “My Lord will blow them into bits and scatter them.”
“Therefore leaving the earth just as an empty plain.”
“In which you shall neither see ups nor downs.”
On that day they will run after a caller, there will be no deviation in it; and voices shall become hushed before the Most Gracious, so you will not hear except a faint sound.
On that day no one’s intercession shall benefit except his to whom the Most Gracious has given permission and whose word He has liked. (The Holy Prophets and virtuous people will be given the permission to intercede.
He knows all that is before them and all that is behind them, whereas their knowledge cannot encompass it.
And all faces shall bow before the Living, the All Sustaining; and the one who bore the burden of injustice, has failed.
And the one who does some good deeds, and is a Muslim – he shall have no fear of injustice, nor suffer any loss.
And this is how We revealed it as an Arabic Qur’an, and in different ways gave promises of punishment, that they may fear or it may create some pondering in their hearts.
Therefore Supreme is Allah, the True King; and do not hasten in the Qur’an (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) until its divine revelation has been completed to you; and pray, “My Lord, bestow me more knowledge.”
And indeed before this We made a covenant with Adam, so he forgot, and We did not find its intention (in him).
And when We commanded the angels, “Prostrate before Adam” – so they all prostrated, except Iblis; he refused.
We therefore said, “O Adam, he is your and your wife’s enemy, so may he not get you both out from heaven, so you then fall into hardship.”
“Indeed for you in heaven is that you may never be hungry nor be unclothed.”
“And that you never feel thirsty nor hot sunshine hurt you.”
So the devil incited him, saying, “O Adam, shall I show you the tree of immortality and a kingdom that does not erode?”
So they both ate from it – thereupon their shame became manifest to them, and they started applying on themselves the leaves of heaven; and Adam lapsed in obeying his Lord, so did not reach his goal. (Of achieving immortality)
Then his Lord chose him, and inclined towards him with His mercy, and guided him.
He said, “Both of you go down from heaven, one of you is an enemy to the other; then if the guidance from Me comes to you – then whoever follows My guidance, will not go astray nor be ill-fated.”
“And the one who turned away from My remembrance – for him is a confined existence, and We shall raise him blind on the Day of Resurrection.”
He will say, “O my Lord, why have You raised me blind, whereas I was sighted?”
He will say, “Similarly did Our signs come to you but you forgot them; and in the same way, nobody will heed you today.”
And this is how We reward him who transgresses and does not accept faith in the signs of his Lord; and indeed the punishment of the Hereafter is the most severe and more lasting.
So did they not gain guidance from (knowing) how many generations We have destroyed before them, among whose dwellings they walk?
Indeed in it are signs for men of intellect.
And had not a command of your Lord been passed, then the punishment would have gripped them – and had a term not been appointed.
Therefore (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), patiently forbear upon their speech, and praising your Lord proclaim His Purity, before the sun rises and before it sets; and proclaim His Purity at some times of the night and at the two ends of the day, in the hope that you be pleased. (*With the great reward from your Lord)
And O listener, do not extend your eyes towards what We have given to disbelieving couples to enjoy – the bloom of the worldly life – so that We may test them with it; and the sustenance of your Lord is the best, and more lasting.
And command your household to establish prayer, and yourself be steadfast in it; We do not ask any sustenance from you; We will provide you sustenance; and the excellent result is for piety.
And the disbelievers said, “Why does he not bring to us a sign from his Lord?”; did not the explanation of what is in the former Books, come to them?
And had We destroyed them with some punishment before the advent of a Noble Messenger, they would have certainly said, “Our Lord, why did You not send a Noble Messenger to us, so we would have followed Your signs, before being humiliated and disgraced?”
Proclaim, “Each one is waiting; so you too wait; very soon you will come to know who are the people of the right path, and who has attained guidance.”
The people’s reckoning is near, whereas they are in neglect, turned away!
Whenever a new advice comes to them from their Lord, they do not listen to it except while playing.
Their hearts are involved in play; and the unjust secretly conferred, “What is he, except another a human like you?!
So do you follow magic although you have perceived?”
And the Prophet said, “My Lord knows all that is spoken in the heavens and in the earth; and He only is the All Hearing, the All Knowing."
Rather they said, “These are confused dreams, but in fact he has fabricated it – but in fact he is a poet; so he must bring us some sign, like those who were sent before.”
There is not a township before them which did not believe which We have not destroyed; so will they believe?
And We did not send (Prophets) before you except men, to whom We sent divine revelations – therefore, O people, ask the people of knowledge if you do not know.
And We did not create them without bodies so they would not eat food – nor that they abide on earth forever.
We then fulfilled the promise to them, therefore rescued them and whomever We willed, and destroyed the transgressors.
We have indeed sent down towards you a Book, in which is your repute; so do you not have sense?
And many a township did We destroy, for they were unjust, and We created other nations after them.
And when they tasted Our punishment, they immediately started fleeing from it.
The angels said to them, “Do not flee and return to the comforts that were given to you and to your homes, perhaps you will be questioned.”
They cried, “Woe to us, we were indeed unjust!”
So they kept saying this until We made them cut off, extinguished.
And We have not created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, unnecessarily.
If We willed to choose a pastime, We could have chosen it from Ourselves – if We wanted to.
But in fact We hurl the truth upon falsehood, so it scatters its brains – thereupon it vanishes; and for you is the ruin due to the matters you fabricate.
And to Him only belong all those who are in the heavens and in the earth; and those with Him are not conceited towards worshipping Him, nor do they tire.
They say His Purity night and day, and do not slacken.
Have they appointed from the earth, Gods that create something?
If other than Allah, there were Gods* in the heavens and the earth, they would be destroyed; therefore Purity is to Allah, Owner of the Throne, from the matters that they fabricate. (* Which is not possible. ** The heavens and the earth.)
He is not questioned whatever He does, whereas they will all be questioned.
Or have they set up other Gods besides Allah?
Say, “Bring your proof; this is the remembrance of those with me and those before me”; but in fact most of them do not know the Truth, so they turn away.
And We did not send any Noble Messenger before you, but We divinely revealed to him that, “There is no God except I (Allah), therefore worship Me alone.”
And they said, “The Most Gracious has chosen a son – Purity is to Him!
In fact they are honourable bondmen.”
They do not speak before He has, and they act only at His command.
He knows what is before them and what is behind them, and they do not intercede except for him whom He likes, and they fear with awe of Him. (The Holy Prophets and virtuous people will be given the permission to intercede.
And the one among them who says, “I am a God beside Allah” – We shall reward him with hell; this is how We punish the unjust.
Did not the disbelievers observe that the heavens and the earth were together, so We parted them, and we made every living thing from water?
So will they not accept faith?
And We have placed mountains as anchors in the earth so that it may not shake with them; and We kept wide roads in it, so that they may find guidance.
And We have made the sky a roof, protected; and they turn away from its signs.
And it is He Who created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon; each one floats in an orbit.
And before you, We did not appoint on earth a never-ending life for any human; will they, if you depart, become immortal?
Every living being must taste death; and We test you with harm and with good – a trial; and to Us only you have to return.
And when the disbelievers see you, they do not appoint you except as an object of mockery; “Is he the one who speaks ill of your Gods?”; whereas they deny the remembrance of the Most Gracious Himself!
Man has been created hasty; very soon I shall show you My signs, do not be impatient.
And they say, “When will this promise occur, if you are truthful?
If only the disbelievers realised the time when they will not be able to stop the fire from their faces and from their backs – and nor are they to be helped.
In fact it will suddenly come upon them, therefore shocking them, and they will not be able to repel it nor will they be given respite.
And indeed the Noble Messengers before you were mocked at, but their mockery ruined the mockers themselves.
Proclaim, “Who guards you night and day from the Most Gracious?”
In fact they have turned away from the remembrance of their Lord.
Do they have some Gods who protect them from Us?
Neither can they save themselves nor save their friends from Us.
But in fact We have given these (disbelievers) and their fathers a benefit to the extent that life became long for them; so do they not see that We are reducing the land from its borders?
So will these be victorious?
Proclaim (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) “I warn you only with the divine revelation; and the deaf do not hear the call when warned.”
And if a whiff of your Lord’s punishment were to touch them, they would certainly say, “Woe to us – we were indeed unjust!”
And We shall set up the scales of justice on the Day of Resurrection – therefore no soul will be wronged in the least; and if a thing is equal to a grain of mustard seed, We will bring it; and We are Sufficient to (take) account.
And indeed We gave Moosa and Haroon the Judgement* and a light and an advice for the pious. (* The Holy Book Taurat.)
Those who fear their Lord without seeing and who apprehend the Last Day.
This is a blessed remembrance, sent down by Us; so do you deny it?
And indeed We bestowed Ibrahim with guidance from the beginning, and We were Aware of him.
When he said to his father and his people, “What are these idols before whom you squat (worshipping)?”
They said, “We found our forefathers worshipping them.”
He said, “Indeed you all – you and your forefathers – were in open error.”
They said, “Have you brought the Truth to us, or are you just making fun?”
He said, “In fact, your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the One Who created them; and I am of those who testify to it.”
“And, by oath of Allah, I shall seek to harm your idols after you have gone away and turned your backs.”
He shattered them all, except the biggest among them, that perhaps they may question it.
They said, “Who has done this to our Gods?
He is indeed cruel!”
Some among them said, “We heard a youth speak ill of them – the one called Ibrahim.”
They said, “Therefore bring him in front of the people, perhaps they may testify.”
They said, “Did you do this to our Gods, O Ibrahim?”
Said he, “Rather, their chief may have done it; so question them, if they can speak.”
So they turned towards their own selves and (inwardly) said, “Indeed you yourselves are unjust.”
Again they were inverted upon their heads; saying, “You know well that these do not speak.”
He said, “What! You worship, instead of Allah, one that neither benefits you nor harms you?”
“Disgrace be upon you and all the idols whom you worship instead of Allah; so do you not have sense?”
They said, “Burn him and help your Gods, if you want to.”
We said, “O fire, become cool and peaceful upon Ibrahim.”
And they wished to cause him harm, so We made them the greatest of losers.
And We rescued him and Lut towards the land which We have blessed for the entire world.
And We bestowed him Ishaq, and Yaqub the grandson; and We made all of them worthy of Our proximity.
And We made them leaders who guide by Our command, and We sent them the divine revelation to do good deeds and to keep the prayer established and to give charity; and they used to worship Us.
And We gave Lut the kingdom and knowledge, and We rescued him from the township that committed vile deeds; indeed those evil people were disobedient.
And We admitted him into Our mercy; indeed he is among those who deserve Our proximity.
And before this when Nooh called Us – We therefore heard his prayer and rescued him and his household from the great calamity.
And We helped him against the people who denied Our signs; indeed they were evil people, We therefore drowned them all.
And remember Dawud and Sulaiman, when they were deciding the dispute of a field, when some people’s sheep had strayed into it at night; and We were Present at the time of their deciding.
And We explained the case to Sulaiman; and to both We gave the kingdom and knowledge; and subjected the hills to proclaim the Purity along with Dawud, and (also subjected) the birds; and these were Our works.
And We taught him to make a garment for you, to protect you from your hurt; so will you be thankful?
And We subjected the fast wind for Sulaiman, which moved by his command towards the land in which We have placed blessings; and We know everything.
And among the devils, were those who dived (in water) for him and did works other than this; and We had kept them restrained.
And remember Ayyub (Job), when he called his Lord that, “Hardship has afflicted me, and You are the Most Merciful of all those who have mercy.”
We therefore heard his prayer and removed the adversity that had afflicted him, and We gave him his family and in addition bestowed along with them a similar number, by mercy from Ourselves – and an advice for the people who worship.
And remember Ismail, and Idrees, and Zul-Kifl; they were all patiently enduring.
And We admitted them into Our mercy; indeed they are among those who deserve Our proximity.
And remember Zun-Noon,* when he left in anger, assuming that We would not restrict him – he therefore called out in the realms of darkness, saying, “There is no God except You, Purity is to You; I have indeed committed a lapse.” (* Prophet Yunus – peace and blessings upon him)
We therefore heard his prayer and rescued him from grief; and similarly We shall rescue the Muslims.
And remember Zakaria, when he prayed to his Lord, “O my Lord – do not leave me alone, and You are the Best Inheritor.
We therefore heard his prayer; and bestowed him Yahya, and cured his wife for him; indeed they used to hasten to perform good deeds, and pray to Us with hope and fear; and used to weep before Us.
And remember the woman who maintained her chastity, We therefore breathed Our Spirit into her and made her and her son a sign for the entire world.
Indeed this religion of yours, is one religion; and I am your Lord, therefore worship Me.
And others have shattered their works into pieces among themselves; all have to return to Us.
So whoever does some good deeds, and is a believer, then his efforts will not be ignored; and We are recording it.
And it is forbidden for any township which We have destroyed, that they may return. (Once the disbelievers face death, their return to earth is impossible.)
Till the time when Yajuj and Majuj are released, and they will be flowing down from every height.
And the True Promise has come near – thereupon the eyes of the disbelievers will become fixed, staring wide; saying “Woe to us – we were in neglect of this, but in fact we were unjust.”
“Indeed you* and all that you worship** besides Allah, are the fuel of hell; in it you must go.” (* All disbelievers ** Idols and disbelievers who claimed to be Gods.
The Prophets like Eisa and Uzair who were worshipped are exempt from this, and so are Maryam, and trees and the moon etc.)
“Had these been Gods they would not go into hell; and they have to remain in it.”
They will bray in it and not be able to hear anything in it.
Indeed those to whom Our promise of goodness has been made, have been kept far away from hell.
And they will not hear its faintest sound; and they will forever abide in whatever their hearts desire.
The greatest fear will not aggrieve them, and the angels will welcome them; saying “This is your day, which you were promised.”
The day when We shall roll up the heavens as the recording angel rolls up the register of deeds; We shall make him similar to Our making him the first time; this is a promise upon Us; We certainly have to do it.
And indeed We wrote, after the reminder in the Zaboor that, “My virtuous bondmen will inherit the earth.”
This Qur’an is sufficient for people who are devout.
And We did not send you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) except as a mercy for the entire world. (Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him – is the Prophet towards all mankind.)
Proclaim, “It is divinely revealed to me that your God is the only One God – Allah; do you therefore become Muslims?”
Then if they turn away, proclaim, “I have proclaimed a war against you on equal terms; and what do I know whether the promise which is given to you, is close or far?”
“Indeed Allah knows whatever is said, and knows all what you conceal.”
“And what do I know – it may be a trial for you, and an enjoyment for a time.”
And the Prophet submitted, “My Lord – render the true judgement”; “And only the help of Our Lord, the Most Gracious, is sought against all what you fabricate.”
O people, fear your Lord; indeed the earthquake of the Last Day is a tremendous thing.
On the day when you will witness it, every nursing mother will forget her nurseling and every pregnant one will discharge her burden, and you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) will see people as if they are drunk, whereas they will not be intoxicated, but the fact is that Allah’s punishment is very severe.
And among people are some who argue concerning Allah without knowing, and blindly follow every rebellious devil.
(The devil) Upon whom is decreed that whoever befriends him, he will certainly mislead him and show him the path to hell.
O people, if you doubt your revival on the Day of Resurrection, then ponder that We created you from dust, then from a drop of liquid, then from a clot, then from a piece of flesh formed and without form, so that We show you Our signs for you; and We keep whomever We want inside the mothers’ wombs up to an appointed time, then extract you as infants, then in order that you reach your puberty; and among you is one who dies earlier, and among you is one put to the most abject age, so after having knowledge, knows nothing; and you see the earth desolate, then when We sent down water upon it, it freshened up and developed and produced beautiful pairs of all kinds.
This is because Allah only is True and because He will revive the dead, and because He is Able to do all things.
And because the Last Day will come, there is no doubt in it – and because Allah will revive those who are in the graves.
And there is one who argues concerning Allah without having knowledge nor any proof nor a clear text.
With his neck turned away from the truth, in order to deceive from the way of Allah; for him is disgrace in this world and on the Day of Resurrection We shall make him taste the punishment of fire.
“This is the recompense of what your hands have sent ahead, and Allah does not oppress His bondmen."
And there are some men who worship Allah upon an edge; then if some good occurs to them, they are content; and if some trial comes, they turn way upon their faces; a loss of this world and the Hereafter; and this is the complete loss.
They worship such, beside Allah, which neither harms them nor benefits them; this only is the extreme error.
They worship one from whom harm is expected more than the benefit; indeed what an evil master and indeed what an evil friend!
Indeed Allah will admit those who believed and did good deeds, into Gardens beneath which rivers flow; indeed Allah does whatever He wills.
Therefore whoever assumes that Allah will not assist His Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) in this world and the Hereafter, should extend a rope upwards and hang himself, and then see whether his scheme has taken away what he envies.
And so it is, that We sent down this Qur’an – clear verses – and that Allah guides whomever He wills.
Indeed the Muslims, and the Jews, and the Sabeans, and the Christians and the fire worshippers and the polytheists – indeed Allah will decide between all of them on the Day of Resurrection; indeed Allah witnesses all things.
Did you not see that for Allah prostrate those who are in the heavens and in the earth, and the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and the hills, and the trees, and the beasts, and many among mankind; and there are many upon whom the punishment has been decreed; and he whom Allah disgraces – there is none to give him honour; indeed Allah may do whatever He wills.
(Command of Prostration # 6)
These are the two groups who fought concerning their Lord; so those who disbelieved – garments of fire have been fashioned for them; and boiling water will be poured onto their heads.
With which will melt what is in their bellies, and their skins.
And for them are rods of iron.
Whenever they wish to come out of it due to suffocation, they will be returned to it again and it will be commanded, “Taste the punishment of fire!”
Indeed Allah will admit those who believed and did good deeds into Gardens beneath which rivers flow – in it they will be made to wear armlets of gold, and pearls, and in it their garment is silk.
And they were guided to sacred speech; and they were shown the path of the Most Praiseworthy.
Indeed those who have disbelieved and prevent from the way of Allah and from this Sacred Mosque, which We have appointed for all mankind – its resident and the foreigner have the same rights in it; and whoever wrongfully intends injustice in it – We shall make him taste a painful punishment.
And remember when We showed Ibrahim the right place of the Sacred House (mosque) and commanded that, “Do not ascribe anything as a partner to Me, and keep My House clean for those who encircle it and those who stay in it (for worship) and those who bow and prostrate.”
“And publicly announce the pilgrimage to all people – they will come to you, on foot and on every lean she-camel, coming from every far distant journey.” (The announcement by Prophet Ibrahim reached each and every soul.)
In order that they may gain their benefit, and mention the name of Allah on the appointed days as He has bestowed the sustenance to them – the inarticulate animals; therefore eat from them yourself and feed the distressed destitute.
They must then remove their dirt and fulfil their pledges and go around the Free House.
So it is; and whoever reveres the sacred things of Allah – that is then a goodness for him in the sight of his Lord; the inarticulate animals are lawful to you except those the forbidding of which is recited to you, therefore shun the filth of idols, and avoid false speech.
Devoting yourself to Allah, not ascribing any partner to Him; and whoever ascribes partners to Allah is as if he has fallen from the sky and the birds snatch him or the wind blows him away to a far-off place.
So it is; and whoever reveres the symbols of Allah – this is then part of the piety of the hearts.
In the cattle are benefits for you up to a fixed time and then they are to be brought to the Free House.
And for every nation We have appointed a sacrifice, that they may mention the name of Allah over the inarticulate animal which He has provided them; so (remember) your God is One God, therefore submit only to Him; and give glad tidings (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) to the humble.
Those whose hearts fear when Allah is mentioned, and those who patiently endure whatever befalls them, and those who keep the prayer established, and who spend part of what We have provided to them.
And the large sacrificial animals – the camels and the cows – We have made them among the symbols of Allah, there is goodness for you in them; therefore mention the name of Allah over them with their one leg tied and standing on three feet; then when their flanks have fallen, eat from it yourself and feed the one who patiently awaits, and the beggar; this is how We have given them in your control, so that you be grateful.
Never does their flesh nor their blood reach Allah, but your piety successfully reaches Him; this is how We have given them in your control so that you may speak His Greatness for guiding you; and O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) give glad tidings to the virtuous.
Indeed Allah repels the afflictions of the Muslims; indeed Allah does not like any extremely disloyal ingrate.
Permission is granted to those against whom the disbelievers wage war, as they are being wronged; and indeed Allah is Able to assist them.
Those who were unjustly expelled from their homes just because they said, “Allah is Our Lord”; and had Allah not repelled some men by means of other men, the abbeys, churches, synagogues and mosques – in which the name of Allah is profusely mentioned – would definitely be demolished; and indeed Allah will assist the one who helps His religion; indeed surely Allah is Almighty, Dominant.
The people who, if We give them control in the land, would keep the prayer established and pay charity and enjoin virtue and forbid from evil; and for Allah only is the result of all works.
If they belie you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), then indeed the people of Nooh, and the tribes of A’ad and Thamud have belied before them.
And (so did) the people of Ibrahim and the people of Lut.
And the people of Madyan; and Moosa was belied, so I gave the disbelievers respite and then seized them, so how (dreadful) was My punishment!
And many a township did We destroy, for they were oppressors – so they now lie flat on their roofs, and many a well lying useless and many a palace in ruins.
So have they not travelled in the land, to have hearts with which to understand and ears to hear with?
So it is not the eyes that are blind, but it is the hearts in the bosoms, that are blind.
And they ask you for the punishment – they are impatient – and Allah will not make His promise untrue; and indeed a single day before Allah is like a thousand years in your calculation.
And to many a township did I give respite although they were oppressors; then I seized them; and towards Me is the return.
Proclaim, “O mankind, I am for you only a clear Herald of Warning.”
So those who believed and did good deeds, for them are forgiveness, and an excellent sustenance.
And those who strive in Our signs with the intention of disputing, are the people of fire.
And all the Noble Messengers or Prophets whom We sent before you – it occurred with all of them – that whenever they recited (the message) Satan included a bit (from his own speech) in their recitation to the people; so Allah obliterates what Satan includes and then Allah fortifies His verses; and Allah is All Knowing, Wise.
So that He may make what the devil includes a trial for those in whose hearts is a disease, and those whose hearts are hardened; indeed the unjust are extremely quarrelsome.
And so that the people given the knowledge may know that it is the truth from your Lord, in order that they may accept faith in it, therefore their hearts may humble before Him; and indeed Allah will guide the believers on the Straight Path.
And the disbelievers will always be in doubt of it, to the extent that the Last Day will suddenly come upon them, or will come upon them the punishment of a day the result of which is not at all good for them.
For Allah only is the kingship on that day; He will judge between them; so those who believed and did good deeds are in Gardens of content.
And those who disbelieved and denied Our signs – for them will be a disgraceful punishment.
And those who left their homes and belongings in Allah's cause and were then killed or died – Allah will therefore indeed provide for them an excellent sustenance; and indeed the sustenance bestowed by Allah is the best.
He will certainly admit them to a place they will love; and indeed Allah is All Knowing, Most Forbearing.
So it is; and whoever retaliates similarly to the affliction he was made to suffer, and then he is wronged again – so Allah will definitely assist him; indeed Allah is Oft Pardoning, Oft Forgiving.
This is because Allah inserts the night into a part of the day and inserts the day into a part of the night, and because Allah is All Hearing, All Seeing.
This is because Allah only is the Truth, and what they worship other than Him, is itself falsehood, and because Allah only is the Supreme, the Great.
Did you not see that Allah sent down water from the sky, so the earth became green at morn?
Indeed Allah is Pure, Aware.
To Him only belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth; and indeed Allah only is the Perfect (Not Needing Anything), the Most Praiseworthy.
Did you not see that Allah has given in your control all that is in the earth – and the ship that moves upon the sea by His command?
And He restricts the heavens that it may not fall on to the earth except by His command; indeed Allah is Most Compassionate, Most Merciful upon mankind.
And it is He Who gave you life, then will cause you to die, and will then revive you; indeed man is very ungrateful.
For each nation We have made the rules of worship for them to follow – so never should they quarrel with you in this matter – and call them towards your Lord; indeed you are upon the Straight Path.
And if they quarrel with you, say, “Allah well knows your evil deeds.”
Allah will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection concerning what you dispute.
Did you not realise that Allah knows all that is in the heavens and in the earth?
Indeed all this is in a Book; indeed this is easy for Allah.
And they worship those instead of Allah regarding whom He has not sent down any proof, and those regarding whom they themselves do not have any knowledge; and there are no supporters for the unjust.
And when Our clear verses are recited to them, you will see traces of anger in the faces of the disbelievers; possibly they may attack those who recite Our verses to them; say, “Shall I show you what is worse than your current state?
That is the fire!
Allah has promised it to the disbelievers; and what a wretched place to return!”
O people, an example is being illustrated therefore listen to it attentively; “Those whom you worship besides Allah can never create a fly even if they all come together for it; and if a fly took away something from them, they cannot retrieve that from it; how weak are the seeker and the sought!”
They did not realise the importance of Allah as was His right; indeed Allah is Almighty, Dominant.
Allah chooses the Noble Messengers from the angels, and from men; indeed Allah is All Hearing, All Seeing.
He knows all that is before them and all that is behind them; and towards Allah is the return of all matters.
O People who Believe, bow and prostrate yourselves, and worship your Lord, and do good deeds in the hope of attaining salvation.
And fight in Allah's cause as is the true manner of fighting; He has preferred you and has not kept any hardship upon you in religion; the religion of your father Ibrahim; Allah has named you Muslims – in the previous Books and in this Qur’an, so that the Noble Messenger be your guardian and witness, and you be witness against other people; therefore keep the prayer established and give charity, and hold fast to the rope of Allah; He is your Master; so what an excellent Master and what an excellent Supporter!
Successful indeed are the believers.
Those who humbly cry in their prayers.
And who do not incline towards indecent matters.
And who pay the (obligatory) charity.
And who guard their private organs.
Except from their wives or the legal bondwomen that they possess, for then there is no blame upon them.
So whoever desires more than these two – they are crossing the limits.
And those who keep proper regard for their trusts and their pledges.
And who guard their prayers.
They are the inheritors.
Those who will get the inheritance of Paradise; they will abide in it forever.
Indeed We created man from a chosen soil.
Then made him a drop of fluid in a secure shelter.
We then turned the drop of fluid into a clot of blood, then the clot into a small lump of flesh, then the lump into bones, then covered the bones with flesh; then developed it in a different mould; therefore Most Auspicious is Allah, the Best Creator.
Then after that, certainly all of you are to die.
Then you will all be raised on the Day of Resurrection.
And indeed We have created seven paths above you; and We are not unmindful of the creation.
And We sent down water from the sky in proper measure, then stored it in the earth; and indeed We are Able to take it away!
So with it We produced gardens of date-palms and grapes for you, in which is abundant fruit for you and you eat therefrom.
And created the tree that comes forth from Mount Sinai – that grows containing oil and curry for the eaters.
And indeed in the cattle is a lesson for you; We give you to drink what is in their bellies, and there are many benefits for you in them, and in them is your food.
And you are carried on them and on the ship.
And indeed We sent Nooh towards his people – he therefore said, “O my people!
Worship Allah, you do not have any other God except Him; so do you not fear?”
So the disbelieving chieftains of his people said, “He is just a human like you, he wishes to become your leader; and had Allah willed, He would have sent down angels; We did not hear this in the case of our forefathers.”
“He is not but a man insane, therefore wait for some time.”
Submitted Nooh, “My Lord! Help me as they deny me.”
So We sent him the divine revelation that, “Make the ship in front of Our sight, and by Our command – then when Our command comes and the oven overflows, embark in it two of every couple, and from your household except those upon whom the Word has been decreed; and do not speak to Me in respect of these unjust people; they will surely be drowned.”
“And when you and those with you have safely boarded the ship say, ‘All praise is to Allah Who has rescued us from the unjust.’”
And pray, “My Lord! Cause me to alight at a blessed place – and You are the Best of all who bring to settle.”
Indeed, surely in this are signs and indeed surely, We were examining.
Then after them, We created another generation.
So We sent among them a Noble Messenger from among them (saying), “Worship Allah, you do not have any other God except Him; so do you not fear?”
And said the leaders of his people, who disbelieved and denied the confronting of the Hereafter – and We had given them comfort in the worldly life – that, “He is nothing but a human like you, he eats from what you eat and drinks from what you drink.”
“If you were to obey a human like yourselves, then surely you are losers!”
“Does he promise you that when you die and turn into dust and bones, you will be raised again?”
“How remote, (really) how remote is the promise you are given!”
“There is nothing except our life of this world, we die and we live, and we are not to be raised.”
“He is just a man who has fabricated a lie against Allah, and we are not going to believe him.”
He said, “My Lord! Help me as they deny me.”
Said Allah, “They will soon wake up at morn, regretting.”
So the true Scream seized them – We therefore made them like rotten hay; so away with the unjust people!
Then after them, We created other generations.
No nation can go before its term ends nor stay back.
We then sent our Noble Messengers, one after another; whenever a nation’s Noble Messenger came to it they denied him, We therefore united the succeeding with the old, and made them history; so far removed be the people who do not believe!
We then sent Moosa and his brother Haroon, with Our signs and a clear proof.
Towards Firaun and his court members – in response they were haughty, and they were in dominance.
They therefore said, “Shall we believe in two humans like ourselves, whereas their nation is servile to us?”
So they denied them – therefore became of those who were destroyed.
And indeed We gave Moosa the Book, that they may attain guidance.
And We made the son of Maryam (Prophet Eisa) and his mother a sign, and We gave them shelter on a height, a place to stay and visible springs.
“O Noble Messengers, eat good clean things, and do good deeds; I know all that you do.”
“And indeed this religion of yours is one religion only and I am your Lord, therefore fear Me.”
But their nations broke their tasks into pieces; every group happy with what it has.
So leave them in their intoxication till a time.
Do they assume that the wealth and sons which We provide them –
Are quickly giving them goodness?
In fact, they do not know.
Indeed those who are overwhelmed due to the fear of their Lord –
And those who believe in the signs of their Lord –
And those who do not ascribe any partner to their Lord –
And those who give what they give and their hearts fear for they have to return to their Lord.
These people hasten to perform goodness, and it is they who shall reach it first.
And We do not burden any soul beyond its capacity, and with Us is a Book* that speaks the truth, and they will not be wronged. (* The preserved tablet or the record of one’s deeds.)
On the contrary, their hearts are in neglect of this and their works are different than those of the believers, the works that they are doing.
To the extent that when We seized the wealthy among them with punishment, they immediately began imploring.
“Do not implore this day; you will not be helped by Us.”
“My verses were recited to you, so you used to turn back on your heels.”
“Priding yourself in serving the Sacred Mosque; at night you utter indecent stories in it, while discarding the truth.”
Have they not pondered the matter, or did that come to them, which did not come to their forefathers?
Or is it that they did not recognise their Noble Messenger, therefore they consider him alien?
Or they say, “He is afflicted by a demon”; in fact he brought the Truth to them, and most of them dislike the Truth.
And had the Truth followed their desires, then indeed the heavens and the earth and all those who are in them would be destroyed; in fact We brought to them a thing in which lay their repute, so they are turned away from their own repute.
Do you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) ask any fee from them?
So the reward of your Lord is the best; and He is the Best Provider of Sustenance.
And indeed you call them to the Straight Path.
And indeed those who do not believe in the Hereafter are deviated from the Straight Path.
And if We have mercy upon them and remove the calamity which has befallen them, they would still stubbornly persist, wandering in their rebellion.
And indeed We grasped them with punishment, so neither did they submit themselves to their Lord, nor do they cry humbly.
To the extent that when We opened the gate of a severe punishment for them, they thereupon lie despairingly in it.
And it is He Who has created ears and eyes and hearts for you; very little is the right you acknowledge.
And it is He Who has spread you in the earth, and towards Him you are to be raised.
And it is He Who gives life and causes death, and for Him are the alternations of night and day; so do you not have sense?
On the contrary, they said the same as what the former people used to say.
They say, “Will we, when we die and turn into dust and bones, be raised again?”
“Indeed this promise was given to us and before us to our forefathers – this is nothing but stories of earlier people.”
Say O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “To Whom does the earth and all that is in it belong to, if you know?”
Thereupon they will say, “To Allah”; proclaim, “Therefore why do you not ponder?”
Say, “Who is the Lord of the seven heavens, and the Lord of the Tremendous Throne?”
Thereupon they will say, “Such greatness is only that of Allah”; say, “So why do you not fear?”
Say, “In Whose hand is the control over all things, and He provides refuge, and none can provide refuge against Him, if you know?”
Thereupon they will say, “Such greatness is only that of Allah”; say, “Then by what magic are you deceived?”
In fact We brought the Truth to them, and indeed they are liars.
Allah has not chosen any child, nor any other God along with Him – were it so, each God would have taken away its creation, and each one would certainly wish superiority over the other; Purity is to Allah above all the matters they fabricate.
The All Knowing, of every hidden and the visible – so Supremacy is to Him over their ascribing of partners (to Him).
Pray, “My Lord! If You show me the promise they are given,”
“Therefore my Lord, do not group me with the unjust.”
And indeed We are Able to show you the promise they are given.
Repel evil with the best deeds; We well know the matters that they fabricate.
And submit, “My Lord! I seek Your refuge from the instigation of the devils.”
“And my Lord, (I seek) Your refuge from their coming to me.”
Until, when death comes to one* of them, he says, “O my Lord, send me back!” (The disbelievers)
“Perhaps I may do some good deeds in what I have left behind”; this is just a word that he utters from his mouth; and confronting them is a barrier until the day in which they will be raised.
So when the Trumpet is blown – so there will neither be any relationship among them* that day, nor will they ask about one another. (The disbelievers)
Therefore the ones whose scales prove heavy – they are the successful.
And the ones whose scales prove light – it is they who put their lives into ruin, remaining in hell forever.
The fire shall scorch their faces, and they will remain dejected in it.
“Were not My verses recited to you, so you used to deny them?”
They will say, “Our Lord! Our ill-fate overcame us, and we were the astray people.”
“Our Lord, remove us from hell – then if we do the same, we are the unjust.”
Allah will say, “Remain rebuked in it, and do not speak to Me.”
"Indeed there was a group among My bondmen who said, 'Our Lord! We have accepted faith, therefore forgive us and have mercy on us, and You are the Best Among The Merciful.' ”
“So you took them for a mockery until your mocking at them made you forget My remembrance, and you used to laugh at them!”
“Indeed this day I have rewarded them for their endurance, so that it is they who are the successful.”
He will say, “How long did you stay on earth, counting by the number of years?
They will say, “We stayed a day or part of a day, so ask those who keep count.”
He will say, “You stayed but only a little, if you knew.”
So do you think that We have created you needlessly, and that you do not have to return to Us?
So Most Supreme is Allah, the True King; there is no God except Him; Lord of the Throne of Honour.
And the one who worships any other God along with Allah – of which he does not have any proof – his account is with his Lord; indeed there is no salvation for the disbelievers.
And (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) say, “My Lord! Forgive and have mercy, and You are the Best of all the Merciful.
This is a chapter which We have sent down and decreed its commands, and in which We have sent down clear verses, in order that you may ponder.
The adulteress and the adulterer – punish each one of them with a hundred lashes; and may you not have pity on them in the religion to Allah, if you believe in Allah and the Last Day; and a group of believers must witness their punishment.
The adulterer shall not marry except an adulteress or a polytheist woman, and none shall marry an adulteress except an adulterer or a polytheist; and this is forbidden for the believers.
And those who accuse chaste women and do not bring four witnesses to testify – punish them with eighty lashes and do not ever accept their testimony; and it is they who are the wicked.
Except those who repent after this and reform themselves; so indeed Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
And those who accuse their wives and do not have witnesses except their own statements – for such the testimony is that he bear the testimony four times by the name of Allah that he is truthful.
And the fifth time, that the curse of Allah be upon him if he is a liar.
And the punishment shall be averted from the woman if she bears the testimony four times by the name of Allah, that the man is a liar.
And the fifth time, that the wrath of Allah be upon her if the man is truthful.
And were it not for Allah’s munificence and His mercy upon you and that Allah is the Acceptor of Repentance, the Wise – He would then have unveiled you.
Indeed those who have brought this great accusation are a group from among you; do not consider it bad for you; on the contrary, it is good for you; for each man among them is the sin that he has earned; and for the one among them who played the greatest part in it – for him is a terrible punishment.
Why was it not that the believing men and women, when you heard it, thought good of their own people, and had said, “This is a clear accusation”?
Why did they not bring four witnesses upon it?
Since they did not bring witnesses, they themselves are liars before Allah.
And were it not for Allah’s munificence and His mercy upon you in the world and in the Hereafter, a terrible punishment would have reached you for the discussions you fell into.
When you rumoured with your tongues after hearing such matters, and uttered with your mouths about which you had no knowledge, and you considered it light; and that, in the sight of Allah, is very great.
And why was it not that, when you heard it, you would have said, “It does not befit us to speak regarding this; Purity is to You, O Allah – this is a great accusation.”
Allah advises you never to speak like this again, if you have faith.
And Allah clearly explains the verses for you; and Allah is All Knowing, Wise.
Indeed those who wish that slander should spread among the Muslims – for them is a painful punishment in this world and in the Hereafter; and Allah knows, and you do not know.
And were it not for Allah’s munificence and His mercy upon you, and that Allah is Forgiving, Most Merciful – you would have tasted its outcome.
O People who Believe!
Do not follow the footsteps of the devil; and whoever follows the footsteps of the devil – so he will only bid the indecent and the evil; and were it not for Allah’s munificence and His mercy upon you, none of you would ever become pure – but Allah purifies whomever He wills; and Allah is All Hearing, All Knowing.
And may not those who possess superiority (in wealth) among you and possess capacity, swear not to give to the relatives and to the needy, and to immigrants in Allah's cause; and they should forgive and forbear; do you not like that Allah may forgive you?
And Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
Indeed those who accuse the innocent virtuous, believing women – upon them is a curse in this world and in the Hereafter; and for them is a terrible punishment.
On the day when their tongues and their hands and their feet will testify against them, regarding what they used to do.
On that day Allah will give them their true punishment, and they will know that Allah only is the Clear Truth.
Vile women for vile men, and vile men for vile women; and virtuous women for virtuous men, and virtuous men for virtuous women; such are innocent of what these people say; for them are forgiveness, and an honourable sustenance.
O People who Believe! Do not enter the houses except your own until you obtain permission and have conveyed peace upon its inhabitants; this is better for you, in order that you may ponder.
And if you do not find anyone in them, even then do not enter without the permission of their owners; and if it is said to you, “Go away” then go away – this is much purer for you; and Allah knows your deeds.
There is no sin upon you to enter houses not made especially for someone’s habitation, and you have permission for its use; and Allah knows what you disclose and what you hide.
Command the Muslim men to keep their gaze low and to protect their private organs; that is much purer for them; indeed Allah is Aware of their deeds.
And command the Muslim women to keep their gaze low and to protect their chastity, and not to reveal their adornment except what is apparent, and to keep the cover wrapped over their bosoms; and not to reveal their adornment except to their own husbands or fathers or husbands’ fathers, or their sons or their husbands’ sons, or their brothers or their brothers’ sons or sisters’ sons, or women of their religion, or the bondwomen they possess, or male servants provided they do not have manliness, or such children who do not know of women’s nakedness, and not to stamp their feet on the ground in order that their hidden adornment be known; and O Muslims, all of you turn in repentance together towards Allah, in the hope of attaining success.
(It is incumbent upon women to cover themselves properly.)
And enjoin in marriage those among you who are not married, and your deserving slaves and bondwomen; if they are poor, Allah will make them wealthy by His munificence; and Allah is Most Capable, All Knowing.
And those who do not have the means to get married must keep chaste till Allah provides them the resources by His munificence; and the bondwomen in your possession who, in order to earn something, seek a letter of freedom from you – then write it for them if you consider some goodness in them; and help them in their cause with Allah’s wealth which He has bestowed upon you; and do not force your bondwomen into the dirty profession, while they wish to save themselves, in order to earn some riches of the worldly life; and if one forces them then indeed Allah, upon their remaining compelled, is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
And indeed We have sent down towards you clear verses, and some account of those who preceded you, and advice for the pious.
Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth; the example of His light is like a niche in which is a lamp; the lamp is in a glass; the glass is as if it were a star shining like a pearl, kindled by the blessed olive tree, neither of the east nor of the west – it is close that the oil itself get ablaze although the fire does not touch it; light upon light; Allah guides towards His light whomever He wills; and Allah illustrates examples for mankind; and Allah knows everything. (The Holy Prophet is a light from Allah)
In the houses (mosques) which Allah has commanded to erect and in which His name is taken – praising Allah in them at morn and evening,
(Are) Those men, whom neither any bargain nor any trade distracts from the Remembrance of Allah and from establishing the prayer and from paying the charity – they fear the day when the hearts and the eyes will be overturned.
In order that Allah may reward them for their best deeds and by His munificence, bestow upon them an increased reward; and Allah gives sustenance to whomever He wills, without account.
And those who disbelieved – their deeds are like a mirage in the wasteland, so the thirsty may believe it to be water; to the extent that when he came close to it, he found it is nothing and found Allah close to him, so He filled his account; and Allah is Swift At Taking Account.
Or like realms of darkness on a deep sea, which is covered by a wave, the wave covered by another wave, and above it is a cloud; layers of darkness upon darkness; if he removes his hand it does not seem visible; and the one to whom Allah does not provide light – there is no light for him anywhere.
Have you not seen that all those who are in the heavens and the earth praise Allah, and the birds with their wings spread (also praise Him)?
Each one has learnt its prayers and its words of praise; and Allah knows their deeds.
And for Allah only is the kingship of the heavens and the earth; and towards Allah is the return.
Have you not seen that Allah slowly transports the clouds, then gathers them together, then heaps them together, so you see the rain coming forth from between them?
And from the sky He sends down hail from the mountains of ice, then sends them upon whomever He wills, and averts them from whomever He wills; it is close that the flash of its lightning take away the eyesight.
Allah alternates the day and the night; indeed in this is a lesson for those who can perceive.
And Allah created every animal on earth, from water; so among them is a kind that moves upon its belly; and among them is a kind that moves upon two legs; and among them a kind that moves upon four legs; Allah creates whatever He wills; indeed Allah is Able to do all things.
And We indeed sent down clear verses; and Allah may guide whomever He wills to the Straight Path.
And they say, “We have accepted faith in Allah and His Noble Messenger, and we obey”; then after that a group among them turns away; and they are not Muslims.
And when called towards Allah and His Noble Messenger in order that the Noble Messenger may judge between them, thereupon a group among them turns away.
And if the judgement is in their favour, they come towards it willingly.
Are their hearts diseased, or do they have doubts, or do they fear that Allah and His Noble Messenger will oppress them?
In fact they themselves are the unjust.
The saying of the Muslims when they are called towards Allah and His Noble Messenger in order that the Noble Messenger judge between them is that they submit, “We hear and we obey”; and it is they who have attained the goal.
And whoever obeys the command of Allah and His Noble Messenger, and fears Allah, and practices piety – so it is they who are the successful.
And they swore by Allah most vehemently in their oaths that if you order them, they will go forth to holy war; say, “Do not swear; obedience according to the law is required; indeed Allah knows what you do.”
Proclaim, “Obey Allah and obey the Noble Messenger; so if you turn away, then the Noble Messenger is bound only for what is obligatory upon him, and upon you is the duty placed upon you”; and if you obey the Noble Messenger, you will attain guidance; and the Noble Messenger is not liable except to plainly convey.
Allah has promised those among you who believe and do good deeds, that He will certainly give them the Caliphate in the earth the way He gave to those before them; and that He will certainly establish for them their religion which He has chosen for them, and will turn their prior fear into peace; they must worship Me and not ascribe anything as a partner to Me; and whoever is ungrateful after this – it is they who are the disobedient.
And keep the prayer established and pay the obligatory charity and obey the Noble Messenger, in the hope of attaining mercy.
Do not ever think that the disbelievers can escape from Our control in the land; and their destination is the fire; and indeed what a wretched outcome!
O People who Believe! The slaves you possess and those among you who have not attained adulthood, must seek your permission on three occasions; before the dawn prayer, and when you remove your garments in the afternoon, and after the night prayer; these three times are of privacy for you; other than these three times, it is no sin for you or for them; moving about around you and among each other; and this is how Allah explains the verses for you; and Allah is All Knowing, Wise.
And when the boys among you reach adulthood, then they too must seek permission like those before them had sought; this is how Allah explains His verses for you; and Allah is All Knowing, Wise.
And the old women residing in houses who do not have the desire of marriage – it is no sin upon them if they discard their upper coverings provided they do not display their adornment; and avoiding even this is better for them; and Allah is All Hearing, All Knowing.
There is no restriction upon the blind nor any restraint upon the lame nor any constraint upon the sick nor on any among you if you eat from your houses, or the houses of your fathers, or the houses of your mothers, or the houses of your brothers, or the houses of your sisters, or the houses of your fathers’ brothers, or the houses of your fathers’ sisters, or the houses of your mothers’ brothers, or the houses of your mothers’ sisters, or from the houses you are entrusted the keys of, or from the house of a friend – there is no blame upon you if you eat together or apart; therefore when you enter the houses, say greetings to your people – the excellent prayer at the time of meeting, from Allah, blessed and pure; this is how Allah explains the verses to you in order that you may understand.
The believers are only those who accept faith in Allah and His Noble Messenger and when they are present with the Noble Messenger upon being gathered for some task, do not go away until they have taken his permission; indeed those who seek your permission, are those who believe in Allah and His Noble Messenger; so if they seek your permission for some affair of theirs, give the permission to whomever you wish among them, and seek Allah’s forgiveness for them; indeed Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
Do not presume among yourselves the calling of the Noble Messenger equal to your calling one another; Allah knows those among you who sneak away by some pretext; so those who go against the orders of the Noble Messenger must fear that a calamity may strike them or a painful punishment befall them.
(To honour the Holy Prophet – peace and blessings be upon him – is part of faith. To disrespect him is blasphemy.)
Pay heed!
Indeed to Allah only belong whatsoever is in the heavens and in the earth; He knows the condition you are in; and on the Day when they are returned to Him, He will then inform them of whatever they did; and Allah knows all things.
Most Auspicious is He Who has sent down the Furqan (the Criterion – the Holy Qur’an) upon His chosen bondman for him to be a Herald of Warning to the entire world. (Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him – is the Prophet towards all mankind.)
The One to Whom belongs the kingship of the heavens and of the earth, and has not chosen a child, and has no partner in His kingship, and He has created everything and kept it in proper measure.
And people have appointed other Gods besides Him, those who do not create anything but are themselves created, and those who do not have the power to harm or benefit themselves, and who do not have any authority over death or life nor over resurrection.
And the disbelievers said, “This is nothing but a slur he has fabricated and others have helped him upon it”; so indeed the disbelievers have stooped to injustice and lie.
And they said, “These are stories of the former people, which he has written down, so they are read to him morning and evening.”
Proclaim (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “It is sent down by Him Who knows all the secrets of the heavens and the earth; indeed He Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful."
And they said, “What is the matter with this (Noble) Messenger, that he eats food and walks in the markets?
Why was not an angel sent down along with him, to give warning along with him?”
“Or that he should have obtained a hidden treasure, or should have had a garden from which to eat”; and the unjust said, “You do not follow but a man under a magic spell.”
O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) see how they invent examples for you – they have therefore gone astray, unable find a road.
Most Auspicious is He Who, if He wills, may make it much better for you – Gardens beneath which rivers flow, and may create high palaces for you.
In fact they deny the Last Day; and We have kept prepared a blazing fire for those who deny the Last Day.
When it will see them from afar, they will hear its raging and roaring.
And when they are thrown into a narrow place in it, bound in chains, they will pray for death in it.
It will be said “Do not pray this day for one death – and pray for many deaths.”
Say, “Is this better or the Everlasting Gardens which are promised to those who fear?
That is their reward and their outcome.”
“In it for them is all that they may desire, abiding in it for ever; a promise incumbent upon your Lord, that is prayed for.”
And on the day when He will assemble them and all what they worship instead of Allah – then will say to those deities, “Did you mislead my bondmen or did they themselves forget the path?”
They will submit, “Purity is to You – it was not rightful for us to appoint any Master besides You; but You gave them and their forefathers usage to the extent that they forgot Your Remembrance; and they were indeed the people who destroy themselves.”
“So the deities have belied what you state – so now you can neither avert the punishment nor help yourself; and whoever among you is unjust, We shall make him taste a terrible punishment.”
And all the Noble Messengers We sent before you were like this – eating food and walking in the markets; and We have made some of you a test for others; so will you, O people, patiently endure?
And O dear Prophet, your Lord is All Seeing.
And those who do not expect to meet Us said, “Why were the angels not sent down to us or we been able to see our Lord?”
Indeed they thought too highly of themselves and they turned extremely rebellious.
The day when they will see the angels – that day will not be of any happiness for the guilty – and they will cry, “O God, erect a barrier between us and them!”
And We turned all the deeds they had performed into scattered floating specks of dust.
And for the People of the Garden on that day is a better destination and account, and a better place of afternoon rest.
And the day when the sky will be split asunder with clouds and the angels will be sent down in full.
The true kingship on that day belongs to the Most Gracious; and that is hard for the disbelievers.
And the day when the unjust will gnaw his hands, saying, “Alas, if only I had chosen a way along with the (Noble) Messenger (of Allah)!”
“Woe to me – alas, if only I had not taken that one for a friend.”
“He indeed led me astray from the advice that had come to me”; and Satan deserts man, leaving him unaided.
And the Noble Messenger submitted, “O my Lord – indeed my people took this Qur’an as worthy of being abandoned.”
And this is how We had appointed guilty people as enemies to every Prophet; and Allah is Sufficient, to guide and to aid.
And the disbelievers say, “Why was the Qur’an not sent down to him all at once?”
This is how We sent it in stages, in order to strengthen your heart with it and We read it slowly, in stages.
And they will never bring you an example, but We shall bring you a true narration and better than it.
Those who will be dragged on their faces towards hell – theirs is the worst destination and they are the most astray.
And indeed We gave Moosa the Book and appointed with him his brother Haroon as a deputy.
We therefore said, “Go, both of you, to the people who have denied Our signs”; then ruining the people, We destroyed them completely.
And the people of Nooh – when they denied the Noble Messengers, We drowned them and made them a sign for mankind; and We have kept prepared a painful punishment for the unjust.
And the tribes of A’ad and the Thamud, and the people of the Wells, and many a generation between them.
And We illustrated examples to each one of them; and ruining them, annihilated them all.
And indeed they have visited the township upon which had rained a harmful rain; so were they not seeing it?
In fact, they never expected to be raised again.
And when they see you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) they take you but as a mockery, “Is this the one whom Allah sent as a (Noble) Messenger?”
“Possibly he would have misled us away from our Gods had we not been firm upon them”; soon they will know, when they see the punishment, who was astray from the path.
Did you see the one who chose his own desires as his God?
So will you accept the responsibility of guarding him?
Or do you think that most of them hear or understand something?
They are not but like the cattle – in fact more astray from the path than them!
O dear Prophet, did you not see your Lord, how He spread the shade?
And if He willed, He could have made it still; then We made the sun a proof upon it.
We then gradually withdraw it towards Us.
And it is He Who made the night a veil for you, and the sleep a rest, and made the day for getting up.
And it is He Who sent the winds giving glad tidings before His mercy; and We sent down purifying water from the sky.
In order that We may revive a dead city with it, and give it to the many beasts and men that We have created, to drink.
And indeed We kept cycles of water among them that they may remember; so most men did not accept, except to be ungrateful.
If We willed, We could have sent a Herald of Warning to every village.
So do not listen to the disbelievers and, with this Qur’an, fight a great war against them.
And it is He Who caused the two joint seas to flow- one is palatable, very sweet, and the other is salty, very bitter; and kept a veil between them and a preventing barrier.
And it is He Who created man from water, then appointed relatives and in-laws for him; and your Lord is All Able.
And they worship such, other than Allah, which neither benefit nor hurt them; and the disbeliever helps the devil instead of his Lord.
And We have not sent you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) except as a Herald of glad tidings and warnings.
Proclaim, “I do not ask any fee from you for this, except that whoever wills may take the way to his Lord.”
And trust the Living One Who will never die, and praising Him proclaim His Purity; and He is Sufficient upon the sins of His bondmen, All Aware.
The One Who created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six days, then befitting His Majesty, established Himself upon the Throne (of control); the Most Gracious – therefore ask the one who knows, concerning Him!
And when it is said to them, “Prostrate to the Most Gracious” – they say, “And what is the Most Gracious?
Shall we prostrate to whatever you command us?” And this command only increases the hatred in them.
(Command of Prostration # 7)
Most Auspicious is He Who created lofty towers in the sky and placed a lamp in it, and the luminous moon.
And it is He Who created the alternation of the night and day for one who wishes to remember or intends to give thanks.
And the bondmen of the Most Gracious who walk upon the earth humbly, and when the ignorant address them they answer, “Peace”. (Good –bye)
And who spend the night prostrating and standing, for their Lord.
And who submit, “Our Lord – avert the punishment of hell from us; indeed its punishment is a permanent neck-shackle.”
Indeed it is a most wretched abode.
And those who, when spending, neither exceed the limits nor act miserly, and stay in moderation between the two.
And those who do not worship any other deity along with Allah, and do not unjustly kill any living thing which Allah has forbidden, nor commit adultery; and whoever does this will receive punishment.
The punishment shall be increased for him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will remain in it forever, with humiliation.
Except one who repents and accepts faith and does good deeds – so Allah will turn their evil deeds into virtues; and Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
And whoever repents and does good deeds – so he has inclined towards Allah with repentance as was required.
And those who do not give false testimony, and when they pass near some indecency, they pass by it saving their honour.
And those who, when they are reminded of the signs of their Lord, do not fall deaf and blind upon them.
And who submit, “Our Lord, soothe our eyes with our wives and our children, and make us leaders of the pious.”
They will be rewarded the highest position in heaven, the recompense of their patience, and they will be welcomed with honour and greetings of peace.
They shall abide in it forever; what an excellent abode and place of stay.
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) “You have no value before My Lord if you do not worship Him; so you have denied – therefore the punishment that remains, will occur.”
Ta-Seen-Meem. (Alphabets of the Arabic language – Allah, and to whomever he reveals, know their precise meanings.)
These are verses of the clear Book.
Possibly you may risk your life (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) by grieving, because they did not believe.
If We will, We can send down on them a sign from the sky so that their leaders would remain bowed before it.
And never does a new advice come to them from the Most Gracious, but they turn away from it.
Indeed they have denied, so now soon coming upon them are the tidings of what they used to scoff at.
Have they not seen the earth, that how many honourable pairs We have created in it?
Indeed in this is a sign; and most of them will not accept faith.
And indeed your Lord – indeed only He is the Almighty, the Most Merciful.
And (remember) when your Lord said to Moosa, “Go to the unjust people.”
“The nation of Firaun; will they not fear?”
He said, “My Lord, I fear that they will deny me.”
“I feel hesitant, and my tongue does not speak fast, therefore make Haroon also a Noble Messenger.”
“And they have an accusation against me, so I fear that they may kill me.”
He said, “Not like this (any more); both of you go with Our signs, We are with you, All Hearing.”
“Therefore approach Firaun then proclaim, ‘We both are Noble Messengers of the Lord Of The Creation.’
‘That you let the Descendants of Israel go with us.’”
Said Firaun, “Did we do not raise you amongst us, as a child?
And you spent many years of your life among us!”
“And you committed the deed of yours that you committed, and you were ungrateful.”
Said Moosa, “I did that at a time when I was unaware of the consequences.” (In anger – See verse 28:15)
“I therefore went away from you as I feared you – so my Lord commanded me and appointed me as one of the Noble Messengers.”
“And is this some great reward for which you express favour upon me – that you have enslaved the Descendants of Israel?”
Said Firaun, “And what is the Lord Of The Creation?
Said Moosa, “Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them; if you believe.”
Said Firaun to those around him, “Are you not listening with attention?”
Said Moosa, “Your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers preceding you.”
Said Firaun, “This (Noble) Messenger of yours, who has been sent towards you, has no intelligence!”
He said, “The Lord of the East and the West and all that is between them; if you have sense.”
Said Firaun, “If you ascribe any one else as a God other than me, I will surely imprison you.”
Said Moosa, “Even if I bring to you something clear?”
Said Firaun, “Then bring it, if you are of the truthful.”
So Moosa put down his staff and it became a visible serpent.
And he drew forth his hand, thereupon it shone bright before the beholders.
Said Firaun to the court members around him, “He is indeed an expert magician.”
“He wishes to expel you out of your land by his magic; so what is your advice?”
They said, “Stop him and his brother, and send gatherers to the cities.”
“To bring to you every expert great magician.”
So the magicians were gathered at a set time on a day appointed.
And it was said to the people, “Have you (also) gathered?”
The people said, “Perhaps we may follow the magicians if they are victorious.”
So when the magicians came, they said to Firaun, “Will we get some reward if we are victorious?”
He said, “Yes, and you will then become close to me.”
Moosa said to them, “Cast whatever you intend to cast.”
So they threw down their ropes and their staves and exclaimed, “By the honour of Firaun, indeed victory is ours!”
Therefore Moosa put forth his staff – so it immediately began swallowing all their fabrications.
The magicians therefore fell down prostrate.
They said, “We have accepted faith in the Lord Of The Creation.”
“The Lord of Moosa and Haroon.”
Said Firaun, “You accepted faith in him before I permitted you!
He is indeed your leader who taught you magic; so now you will come to know; I swear, I will certainly cut off your hands and your feet from alternate sides, and crucify all of you.”
They said, “No harm (in it), we will return to our Lord.”
“We hope that our Lord will forgive us our mistakes, as we are the first to believe.”
And We sent the divine revelation to Moosa that, “Journey along with My bondmen within the night, for you will be pursued.”
So Firaun sent gatherers into the cities.
They announced “These people are a small group.”
“And indeed they have angered all of us.”
“And indeed we are an alert army.”
We therefore got them out from the gardens and water springs.
And from treasures and nice houses.
So it was; and We made the Descendants of Israel its inheritors.
So the Firaun’s people followed them at sunrise.
And when the two groups saw each other, those with Moosa said, “They have caught us.”
Said Moosa, “Never!
Indeed my Lord is with me, He will now show me the way.”
So We sent the divine revelation to Moosa that, “Strike the sea with your staff”; thereupon the sea parted; so each part was like a huge mountain.
And We brought the others close to that place.
And We saved Moosa and all those with him.
Then drowned the others.
Indeed in this is surely a sign, and most of them were not Muslims.
And indeed your Lord – only He is the Almighty, the Most Merciful.
And recite to them the news of Ibrahim.
When he said to his father and his people, “What do you worship?”
They said, “We worship idols, and we keep squatting in seclusion before them.”
He said, “Do they hear you when you call?”
“Or do they benefit you or harm you?”
They said, “In fact we found our forefathers doing likewise.”
He said, “Do you see these – (the idols) whom you worship?”
“You and your forefathers preceding you.”
“They are all my enemies, except the Lord Of The Creation.”
“The One Who created me, so He will guide me.”
“And the One Who feeds me and gives me to drink.”
“And when I fall ill, so it is He Who heals me.”
“And He will give me death, then resurrect me.”
“And the One Who, upon Whom I pin my hopes, will forgive me my mistakes on the Day of Judgement.”
“My Lord, bestow me the command and join me with those who deserve your proximity.”
“And give me proper fame among the succeeding generations.”
“And make me among the inheritors of the Gardens of serenity.”
“And forgive my father* – he is indeed astray.” (His paternal uncle)
“And do not disgrace me on the day when everyone will be raised.”
“The day when neither wealth will benefit nor will sons.”
“Except he who presented himself before Allah, with a sound* heart.” (Intact or unblemished.)
And Paradise will be brought close for the pious.
And hell will be revealed for the astray.
And it will be said to them, “Where are those whom you used to worship?”
“Instead of Allah?
Will they help you or retaliate?”
So they and all the astray were flung into hell.
And all the armies of Iblis. (Satan)
And they will say, and they will be quarrelling in it:
“By oath of Allah, we were indeed in open error.”
“When we considered you equal to the Lord Of The Creation.”
“And none misled us but the guilty.”
“So now we do not have any intercessors.” (The believers shall have intercessors, the disbelievers none).
“Nor a caring friend.”
“So if only were we to go back, in order to become Muslims!”
Indeed in this is a sign; and most of them were not believers.
And indeed your Lord – only He is the Almighty, the Most Merciful.
The people of Nooh denied the Noble Messengers.
When their fellowman Nooh said to them, “Do you not fear?”
“I am indeed a trustworthy Noble Messenger of Allah to you.”
“Therefore fear Allah, and obey me.”
“And I do not ask from you any fee for it; my reward is only upon the Lord Of The Creation.”
“Therefore fear Allah, and obey me.”
They said, “Shall we believe in you, whereas the abject people are with you?”
He said, “What do I know what their deeds are?”
“Indeed their account is only upon my Lord, if you perceive.”
“And I will not repel the Muslims.”
“I am not but clearly a Herald of Warning.”
They said, “O Nooh, if you do not desist you will surely be stoned.”
He said, “My Lord, my people have denied me.”
“Therefore make a decisive judgement between me and them, and rescue me and the believers along with me.”
So We saved him and those with him in a laden ship.
Then after it, We drowned the rest.
Indeed in this is a sign; and most of them were not believers.
And indeed your Lord, only He is the Almighty, the Most Merciful.
(The tribe of) A’ad denied the Noble Messengers.
When their fellowman Hud said to them, “Do you not fear?”
“I am indeed a trustworthy Noble Messenger of Allah to you.”
“Therefore fear Allah and obey me.”
“And I do not ask from you any fee for it; my reward is only upon the Lord Of The Creation.”
“What! You build a structure on every height, to laugh at the passers-by?”
“And prefer strong palaces, that perhaps you may live for ever?”
“And when you apprehend someone, you seize him mercilessly?”
“Therefore fear Allah, and obey me.”
“Fear Him Who has aided you with the things you know.”
“He aided you with cattle and sons.”
“And with gardens and water-springs.”
“Indeed I fear upon you the punishment of a Great Day.”
They said, “It is the same for us, whether you advise us or not be of the preachers.”
“This is nothing but the tradition of former people.”
“And we will not be punished.”
In response they denied him – We therefore destroyed them; indeed in this is a sign; and most of them were not believers.
And indeed your Lord – only He is the Almighty, the Most Merciful.
The Thamud tribe denied the Noble Messengers.
When their fellowman Saleh said to them, “Do you not fear?”
“I am indeed a trustworthy Noble Messenger of Allah to you.”
“Therefore fear Allah and obey me.”
“And I do not ask from you any fee for it; my reward is only upon the Lord Of The Creation.”
“Will you be left peacefully in these favours over here?”
“In gardens and water springs?”
“And fields and palm-trees, with delicate tendrils?”
“And you carve out dwellings in the mountains, with skill?”
“Therefore fear Allah and obey me.”
“And do not follow those who exceed the limits.”
“Those who spread turmoil in the earth, and do no reform.”
They said, “You are under a magic spell.”
“You are just a human like us; therefore bring some sign if you are truthful.”
He said, “This is the she-camel – one day shall be her turn to drink, and on the other appointed day, shall be your turn.”
“And do not touch her with evil intentions for the punishment of the Great Day will seize you.”
So they hamstrung her, and in the morning could only regret.
The punishment therefore seized them; indeed in this is a sign; and most of them were not believers.
And indeed your Lord – only He is the Almighty, the Most Merciful.
The people of Lut denied the Noble Messengers.
When their fellowman Lut said to them, “Do you not fear?”
“I am indeed a trustworthy Noble Messenger of Allah to you.”
“Therefore fear Allah and obey me.”
“And I do not ask from you any fee for it; my reward is only upon the Lord Of The Creation.”
“What! Among all the creatures, you commit the immoral acts with men?”
“And leave the wives your Lord has created for you?
In fact you are people who exceed the limits.”
They said, “O Lut, if you do not desist, you will be expelled.”
He said, “I am disgusted with your works.”
“My Lord, rescue me and my family from their deeds.”
We therefore rescued him and his entire family.
Except one old woman, who stayed behind.
We then destroyed the others.
And We showered a rain upon them; so what a wretched rain for those who were warned!
Indeed in this is a sign; and most of them were not Muslims.
And indeed your Lord – only He is the Almighty, the Most Merciful.
The People of the Woods denied the Noble Messengers.
When Shuaib said to all of them, “Do you not fear?”
“I am indeed a trustworthy Noble Messenger of Allah to you.”
“Therefore fear Allah and obey me.”
“And I do not ask from you any fee for it; my reward is only upon the Lord Of The Creation.”
“Measure in full, and do not be of those who reduce.”
“And weigh with a proper balance.”
“And do not give the people their goods diminished, and do not roam the earth causing turmoil.”
“And fear Him Who created you and the earlier creations.”
They said, “You are under a magic spell.”
“You are just a human like us, and indeed we consider you a liar.”
“Therefore cause a part of the sky to fall upon us, if you are of the truthful.”
He said, “My Lord is Well Aware of what you do.”
In response they denied him – therefore the punishment of the day of the tent* seized them; that was indeed a punishment of a Great Day.
(The clouds formed a tent and rained fire upon them).
Indeed in this is a sign; and most of them were not Muslims.
And indeed your Lord – only He is the Almighty, the Most Merciful.
And indeed this Qur’an has been sent down by the Lord Of The Creation.
The Trustworthy Spirit brought it down. (Angel Jibreel – peace be upon him.)
Upon your heart, for you to convey warning.
In plain Arabic language.
And indeed it is mentioned in the earlier Books.
And was this not a sign for them, that the scholars of the Descendants of Israel may recognise this Prophet?
And had We sent it down upon a person other than an Arab,
In order that he read it to them, even then they would not have believed in it.
This is how We have made (the habit of) denying embedded in the hearts of the guilty.
They will not believe in it to the extent that they see the painful punishment.
So it will come upon them suddenly, whilst they will be unaware.
They will therefore say, “Will we get some respite?”
So do they wish to hasten Our punishment?
Therefore observe, that if We give them some comforts for some years, –
And then the promise that is given to them, does come upon them-
So of what benefit will be the comforts that they were using?
And never did We destroy a township which did not have Heralds of warning, –
To advise; and We never oppress.
And this Qur’an was not brought down by the devils.
They are unworthy of it, nor can they do it.
Indeed they have been banished from the place of hearing.
Therefore do not worship another deity along with Allah, for you will be punished.
And O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), warn your closest relatives.
And spread your wing of mercy for the believers following you.
So if they do not obey you, then say, “Indeed I am unconcerned with what you do.”
And rely upon (Allah) the Almighty, the Most Merciful.
Who watches you when you stand up.
And watches your movements among those who prostrate in prayer.
Indeed only He is the All Hearing, the All Knowing.
Shall I inform you upon whom do the devils descend?
They descend on every great accuser, extreme sinner. (The magicians)
The devils convey upon them what they heard, but most of them are liars.
And the astray follow the poets.
Did you not see that they keep wandering in every valley?
And they speak what they do not do?
Except those who believed and did good deeds, and profusely remembered Allah, and took revenge after they had been wronged*; and soon the unjust will come to know upon which side they will be overturned**. (* The Muslim poets who praise Allah and the Prophet. ** The disbelievers will be punished.)
Ta-Seen*; these are verses of the Qur’an and the clear Book.
(Alphabets of the Arabic language – Allah, and to whomever he reveals, know their precise meanings.)
A guidance and glad tidings for the believers.
Those who keep the prayer established and pay the charity and are certain of the Hereafter.
Those who do not believe in the Hereafter – We have made their deeds seem good to them, so they are astray.
It is they for whom is the worst punishment, and they will be the greatest losers in the Hereafter.
And indeed you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), are taught the Qur’an from the Wise, the All Knowing.
(Remember) when Moosa said to his wife, “I have sighted a fire; I will soon bring its news to you, or bring for you an ember from it so that you may warm yourselves.”
So when he reached it, it was proclaimed, “Blessed is he who is in the location of the fire (Moosa) and those who are close to it (the angels); and Purity is to Allah, the Lord Of The Creation.”
“O Moosa, I am indeed, in truth, Allah the Almighty, the Wise.”
“And put down your staff”; so when he saw it writhing like a serpent, he turned moving away without looking back; We said, “O Moosa, do not fear; indeed the Noble Messengers do not fear in My presence.”
“Except the one* who does injustice and then after evil changes it for virtue – then indeed I am Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.” (Other than the Prophets.)
“And put your hand inside your armpit – it will come out shining white, not due to any illness; a sign among the nine signs towards Firaun and his people; they are indeed a lawless nation.”
Then when Our enlightening signs came to them, they said, “This is clear magic.”
And they denied them – whereas in their hearts they were certain of them – due to injustice and pride; therefore see what sort of fate befell the mischievous!
And We indeed bestowed great knowledge to Dawud and Sulaiman; and they both said, “All praise is to Allah, Who bestowed us superiority over many of His believing bondmen.”
And Sulaiman became Dawud’s heir; and he said, “O people, we have indeed been taught the language of birds, and have been given from all things; this surely is a manifest favour.”
And assembled together for Sulaiman were his armies of jinns and men, and of birds – so they had to be restricted.
Until when they came to the valley of the ants, a she ant exclaimed, “O ants, enter your houses – may not Sulaiman and his armies crush you, unknowingly.”
He therefore smiled beamingly at her speech*, and submitted, “My Lord, bestow me guidance so that I thank you for the favour which You bestowed upon me and my parents, and so that I may perform the good deeds which please You, and by Your mercy include me among Your bondmen who are worthy of Your proximity.” (Prophet Sulaiman heard the voice of the she ant from far away.)
And he surveyed the birds – he therefore said, “What is to me that I do not see the Hudhud (hoopoe), or is he really absent?”
“I will indeed punish him severely or slay him, or he must bring to me some clear evidence.”
So Hudhud did not stay absent for long, and presenting himself submitted, “I have witnessed a matter that your majesty has not seen, and I have brought definite information to you from the city of Saba.”
“I have seen a woman who rules over them, and she has been given from all things, and she has a mighty throne.”
“I found her and her nation prostrating before the sun instead of Allah, and Satan has made their deeds seem good to them thereby preventing them from the Straight Path – so they do not attain guidance.”
“Why do they not prostrate to Allah, Who brings forth the things hidden in the heavens and the earth, and knows all what you hide and all what you disclose?”
“Allah – there is no True God except Him, the Owner of the Great Throne.” (Command of Prostration # 8)
Said Sulaiman, “We shall now see whether you spoke the truth or are among the liars.”
“Go with this letter of mine and drop it upon them – then move aside from them and see what they answer in return.”
The woman said, “O chieftains, indeed a noble letter has been dropped upon me.”
“Indeed it is from Sulaiman, and it is (begins) with ‘Allah – beginning with the name of – the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.’”
“That ‘Do not wish eminence above me, and present yourselves humbly to me, with submission.’”
She said, “O chieftains, advise me in this matter of mine; I do not give a final decision until you are present with me.”
They said, “We possess great strength and are great warriors, and the decision is yours, therefore consider what you will command.”
She said, “Indeed the kings, when they enter a township, destroy it and disgrace its honourable people; and this is what they do.”
“And I shall send a present to them, then see what reply the envoys bring.”
So when the envoy came to Sulaiman, he said, “Are you helping me with wealth?
What Allah has bestowed upon me is better than what He has given you; rather it is you who are delighted at your gift.”
“Go back to them – so we shall indeed come upon them with an army they cannot fight, and degrading them shall certainly drive them out from that city, so they will be humiliated.”
Said Sulaiman, “O court members, which one of you can bring me her throne before they come humbled in my presence?”
An extremely evil jinn said, “I will bring it in your presence before you disperse the assembly; and I am indeed strong and trustworthy upon it.”
Said one who had knowledge of the Book, “I will bring it in your majesty’s presence before you bat your eyelid”; then when he saw it set in his presence*, Sulaiman said, “This is of the favours of my Lord; so that He may test me whether I give thanks or am ungrateful; and whoever gives thanks only gives thanks for his own good; and whoever is ungrateful – then indeed my Lord is the Independent (Not Needing Anything), the Owner Of All Praise.”
(A miracle which occurred through one of Allah’s friends.)
Said Sulaiman, “Disguise her throne in front of her so that we may see whether she finds the way* or becomes of those who remain unknowing.” (*Recognises her throne.)
Then when she came, it was said to her, “Is your throne like this?
She said, “As if this is it!
And we came to know about this incident beforehand and submit (to you).”
And the thing she used to worship instead of Allah prevented her; she was indeed from the disbelieving people.
It was said to her, “Enter the hall”; and when she saw it she thought it was a pool and bared her shins*; said Sulaiman, “This is only a smooth hall, affixed with glass”; she said, “My Lord, I have indeed wronged myself, and I now submit myself along with Sulaiman to Allah, the Lord Of The Creation.” (* In order to cross it)
And indeed We sent to the Thamud, their fellowman Saleh that, “Worship Allah”, thereupon they became two parties quarrelling.
He said, “O my people, why do you hasten upon the evil before the good?
Why do you not seek forgiveness from Allah? Perhaps there may be mercy upon you.”
They said, “We consider you an evil omen, and your companions”; he said, “Your evil omen is with Allah – in fact you people have fallen into trial.”
And there were nine persons in the city who used to cause turmoil in the land and did not wish reform.
Swearing by Allah they said to one another, “We will indeed attack him and his family at night, and then say to his heir, ‘We were not present at the time of slaying of this household, and indeed we are truthful.’”
So they devised a scheme, and We made our secret plan, and they remained neglectful.
Therefore see what was the result of their scheming – We destroyed them and their entire nation.
So these are their houses fallen flat, the recompense of their injustice; indeed in this is a sign for people who know.
And We rescued those who accepted faith and used to fear.
And (remember) Lut when he said to his people, “What! You stoop to the shameful whereas you can see?”
“What! You lustfully go towards men, leaving the women?!
In fact, you are an ignorant people.”
Therefore the answer of his people was nothing except that they said, “Expel the family of Lut from your township; these people wish purity!”
We therefore rescued him and his family, except his wife; We had decreed that she is of those who will remain behind.
And We showered a rain upon them; so what a wretched rain for those who were warned!
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “All praise is to Allah, and peace upon His chosen bondmen; is Allah better or what you ascribe as His partners?”
Or He Who created the heavens and the earth, and sent down water from the sky for you; so We grew delightful gardens with it; you had no strength to grow its trees; is there a God along with Allah?!
In fact they are those who shun the right path.
Or He Who made the earth for habitation, and placed rivers within it, and created mountains as anchors for it, and kept a barrier between the two seas?
Is there a God along with Allah?!
In fact, most of them are ignorant.
Or He Who answers the prayer of the helpless when he invokes Him and removes the evil, and makes you inheritors of the earth?
Is there a God along with Allah?!
Very little do they ponder!
Or He Who shows you the path in the darkness of the land and the sea, and He Who sends the winds before His mercy, heralding glad tidings?
Is there a God along with Allah?!
Supremacy is to Allah above all that they ascribe as partners!
Or He Who initiates the creation, then will create it again, and He Who provides you sustenance from the skies and the earth?
Is there a God along with Allah?!
Proclaim, “Bring your proof, if you are truthful!”
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “None in the heavens and the earth know the hidden by themselves, except Allah; and they do not know when they will be raised.”
Has their knowledge advanced so much as to know the Hereafter? On the contrary, they are in doubt concerning it; in fact they are blind towards it.
And the disbelievers said, “Will we, when we and our forefathers have turned into dust, be removed again?”
“Indeed this promise was given to us, and before us to our forefathers – this is nothing but stories of former people.”
“Proclaim, (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “Travel in the land and see what sort of fate befell the guilty.”
And do not grieve upon them, nor be distressed because of their scheming.
And they say, “When will this promise come, if you are truthful?”
Say, “It could be that a part of what you are impatient for is (already) after you.”
Indeed your Lord is Most Munificent upon mankind, but most men do not give thanks.
And indeed your Lord knows what is hidden in their bosoms, and what they disclose.
And all the hidden secrets of the heavens and the earth are (written) in a clear Book. (The Preserved Tablet)
Indeed this Qur’an narrates to the Descendants of Israel most of the matters in which they differ.
And indeed it is a guidance and a mercy for the Muslims.
Indeed your Lord judges between them with His command; and He is the Almighty, the All Knowing.
Therefore rely on Allah; you are indeed upon the clear Truth.
Indeed the dead* do not listen to your call nor do the deaf* listen to your call, when they flee turning back. (The dead and deaf implies the disbelievers.)
And you will not guide the blind out of their error; and none listen to you except those who accept faith in Our signs, and they are Muslims.
And when the Word (promise) appears upon them, We shall bring forth for them a beast from the earth to speak to them – because the people were not accepting faith in Our signs. (This beast will rise from the earth, when the Last Day draws near.)
And the Day when We will raise from every nation an army that denies Our signs – so the former groups will be held back for the latter to join them.
Until when they all come together, He will say, “Did you deny My signs whereas your knowledge had not reached it, or what were the deeds you were doing?”
And the Word has appeared upon them because of their injustice, so now they do not speak.
Did they not see that We created the night for them to rest in, and created the day providing sight?
Indeed in this are signs for the people who have faith.
And the Day when the Trumpet is blown – so all those who are in the heavens and the earth will be terrified, except whomever Allah wills; and everyone has come to Him, in submission.
And you will see the mountains presuming them fixed whereas they will be moving like the clouds; this is Allah’s making, Who created all things with wisdom; indeed He is Informed of what you do.
Whoever brings a good deed – for him is a reward better than it; and they will be safe from the terror on that Day.
And whoever brings evil – so their faces will be dipped into the fire; what reward will you get, except what you did?
“I (Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) have been commanded to worship the Lord of this city, Who has deemed it sacred, and everything belongs to Him; and I have been commanded to be among the obedient.”
“And to recite the Qur’an”; so whoever attained the right path, has attained it for his own good; and whoever goes astray – so say, “Indeed I am only a Herald of Warning.”
And proclaim, “All praise is to Allah – He will soon show you His signs so you will recognise them”; and (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) your Lord is not unaware of what you, O people, do.”
Ta-Seen-Meem. (Alphabets of the Arabic language – Allah and to whomever he reveals, know their precise meanings.)
These are verses of the clear Book.
We shall narrate to you the true tidings of Moosa and Firaun, for the people who have faith.
Indeed Firaun had achieved dominance in the earth and made its people subservient to him – seeing a group among them weak, he used to kill their sons and spare their women; he was indeed very mischievous.
And We willed to favour those who were weak in the earth, and to make them leaders and to make them the inheritors (of the land and wealth of Firaun’s people).
And to give them control in the land, and to show Firaun and Haman and their armies what they fear from them.
And We inspired the mother of Moosa that, “Suckle him; then when you fear for him, cast him into the river and do not fear nor grieve; We shall indeed return him back to you and make him one of the Noble Messengers.”
So the family of Firaun picked him up, in order that he become their enemy and a sorrow upon them; indeed Firaun and Haman and their armies were guilty.
And Firaun’s wife said, “This child is the comfort of my eyes and yours*; do not kill him; perhaps he may benefit us, or we may adopt him as our son” – and they were unaware.
(Had Firaun also said the same, Allah would have granted him faith.)
And in the morning, the heart of Moosa’s mother became impatient; and she would have almost certainly given away his secret had We not strengthened her heart, so that she may have faith in Our promise.
And she said to his sister, “Go after him” – she therefore observed him from far, and they were not aware.
And We had already forbidden suckle-nurses for him, so she said, “Shall I show you a household that will nurse this child of yours, and they are his well-wishers?”
So We returned him to his mother in order to soothe her eyes and not grieve, and to know that Allah’s promise is true – but most people do not know.
And when he reached his maturity and full strength, We gave him wisdom and knowledge; and this is how We reward the virtuous.
And he entered the city when its inhabitants were sleeping unaware in the afternoon – he therefore found two men fighting; one was from Moosa’s group, and the other from among his enemies; so the one who was of Moosa’s group pleaded to Moosa for help against him who was of his enemies – therefore Moosa punched him thereby finishing him; he said, “This act was from the devil*; indeed he is an open enemy, a misleader.” (* The act of oppressing the man from Bani Israel).
He said, “My Lord! I have indeed wronged my soul* therefore forgive me” – He therefore forgave him; indeed only He is the Oft Forgiving, the Most Merciful. (* By getting angry.)
He said, “My Lord! The way You have bestowed favour upon me, so never will I be a supporter of the guilty.”
So he was in the city at morning fearing, waiting to see what happens – thereupon he sighted the one who had appealed to him the day before, crying out to him for help; Moosa said to him, “Indeed you are clearly astray.”
So when Moosa wished to apprehend the man who was an enemy to them both, he said, “O Moosa! Do you wish to kill me the way you killed a man yesterday?
You only wish to become a strict ruler in the land, and not to make reform.”
And a man came running from the outer part of the city; he said, “O Moosa!
Indeed the court members are considering killing you, therefore go away – I surely am your well-wisher.”
So he left the city in fear, waiting to see what happens; he said, “My Lord!
Rescue me from the unjust people.”
And when he turned his attention towards Madyan he said, “It is likely that my Lord will show me the right path.”
And when he came to the water of Madyan he found a group of men, watering their animals; and away from them he found two women restraining their animals; he said, “What is the matter with you?”
They said, “We do not water our animals till all the shepherds water and take away their animals; and our father is very old.”
Therefore Moosa watered their animals for them, and then turned towards the shade and said, “My Lord! I am in need of the sustenance you may send down for me.”
So one of the two women approached him, walking shyly; she said, “My father is calling you, in order to give you wages because you watered our animals for us”; when Moosa came to him and had told him the story, he said, “Do not fear, you are safe from the unjust people.”
One of the two women said, “O my father! Employ him – indeed a strong and trustworthy employee is better.”
He said, “I wish to give you one of these two daughters of mine in marriage, the bridal money being that you work for me for eight years; then if you complete ten years, it will be from you; and I do not wish to put you in hardship; Allah willing, you will probably find me of the righteous.”
Said Moosa, “This is agreed between me and you; there shall be no claim upon me if I fulfil any of these two terms; and Allah is the Trustee upon this word of ours.”
So when Moosa completed his term and was travelling with his wife, he saw a fire in the direction of the Mount (Sinai); he said to his wife “Stay here – I have sighted a fire in the direction of the mount – perhaps I may bring you some news from it, or an ember so that you may warm yourselves.”
And when he reached the fire, he was called out to from the right side of the valley in the blessed field, from the tree, “O Moosa! Indeed I am truly Allah, the Lord Of The Creation.”
“Put down your staff”; so when Moosa saw it writhing like a serpent, he turned moving away without looking back; “O Moosa!
Come forth and do not fear; indeed you are in peace.”
“Put your hand inside your armpit – it will come out shining white, not due to any illness; and put your hand on your chest to remove the fear – so these are two proofs from your Lord to Firaun and his court members; indeed they are a lawless people.”
He submitted, “My Lord! I killed a soul among them and I fear they will kill me.”
“And my brother Haroon – he is more eloquent than I am in speech, therefore in order to help me, appoint him as a Noble Messenger so that he confirms me; I fear that they will deny me.”
He said, “We will soon strengthen your arm with your brother, and give you both dominance, so they will not be able to harm you; due to Our signs; you both, and those who will follow you, will be victorious.”
Therefore when Moosa came to them with Our clear signs they said, “This is nothing but invented magic, and we never heard anything like this among our forefathers.”
And said Moosa, “My Lord well knows him who has brought guidance from Him, and for whom will be the abode the Hereafter; indeed the unjust never attain success.”
And Firaun said, “O court members! I do not know of any other God for you, except myself; therefore, O Haman, build a lofty palace for me by baking concrete in order that I may sneak a look at the God of Moosa – and according to me, he is indeed a liar.”
And he and his soldiers wrongfully sought greatness in the land, and assumed they would never be brought back to Us.
We therefore seized him and his armies, and hurled them into the sea; therefore see what sort of fate befell the unjust!
And We made them leaders of the people of hell, inviting towards the fire; and they will not be helped on the Day of Resurrection.
And We set a curse after them in this world; and evil is for them on the Day of Resurrection.
And We indeed gave Moosa the Book after We had destroyed the former generations, having enlightenment for mankind, and a guidance and a mercy, for them to accept advice.
And you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) were not on the western side of the Mount when We sent the command of Prophethood to Moosa, and you were not present. (Yet you narrate the account very clearly to the Jews and Christians.)
However, We created generations and ages passed by upon them; and nor were you dwelling with the people of Madyan reciting Our verses to them – however it is We Who made the Noble Messengers.
And nor were you beside the Mount when We proclaimed – however it is a mercy from your Lord* so that you may warn a nation towards whom no Herald of Warning came before you, in the hope of their heeding advice. (*That He has bestowed knowledge of the hidden to you)
Otherwise, if some disaster befell them because of what their own hands have sent forward they would say, “Our Lord! Why did you not send a Noble Messenger towards us, so we may have followed Your signs and accepted faith?”
So when the Truth* from Us came to them, they said, “Why has he not been given what was given to Moosa?”
Had they not disbelieved in what was earlier given to Moosa?
They said, “They are two magicians, who support each other”; and said, “We disbelieve in both of them.” (* Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him).
Proclaim (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “Therefore bring a Book from Allah which is better guiding than these two – I will follow it – if you are truthful.”
So if they do not accept your challenge, then know that they only follow their desires; and who is more astray than one who follows his desires away from the guidance of Allah?
Indeed Allah does not guide the unjust.
And We indeed sent down the Word continuously for them, so that they may ponder.
Those to whom We gave the Book before it, accept faith in it. (Some scholars among Jews / Christians).
And when these verses are recited to them, they say, “We accept faith in it – indeed it is the Truth from our Lord – and indeed we had surrendered even before this.”
They will be given double the reward, the recompense of their patience – and they repel evil with good, and spend part of what We have provided them.
And when they hear indecent speech, they ignore it and say, “For us are our deeds and for you are your deeds; peace be to you (good bye); we are not interested in the ignorant.”
Indeed it is not such that you can guide whomever you love, but Allah guides whomever He wills; and He well knows the people upon guidance.
And they say, “If we follow the guidance along with you, people would snatch us away from our land”; did We not establish them in a safe Sacred Land, towards which are brought fruits of all kinds – the sustenance from Us?
But most of them do not know.
And how many towns did We destroy which had stooped to self indulgence!
So here lie their dwellings, uninhabited after them except a little; and only We are the Inheritors.
And never does your Lord destroy towns until He sends a Noble Messenger to their principal town, reciting Our verses to them; and We never destroy towns unless its people are unjust.
And whatever you have been given, is a usage in the life of this world and its adornment; and that which is with Allah is better and more lasting; so do you not have sense?
So is he whom We have given a good promise – he will therefore get it – equal to him whom We gave the usage of the life of this world to enjoy, and who will then be brought captive on the Day of Resurrection?
On the day when He will call to them – He will therefore proclaim, “Where are those partners of Mine, whom you had assumed?”
Those against whom the Word will have proved true will say, “Our Lord!
These are they whom we led astray; we led them astray the way we ourselves went astray; we are unconcerned with them and we incline towards You – they never worshipped us!”
And it will be said to them, “Call unto your ascribed partners” – so they will call unto them and they will not listen to them, and they will behold the punishment; if only they had obtained guidance!
And on the Day when He will call to them and proclaim, “What answer did you give to the Noble Messengers?”
So on that Day the tidings will be blinded* for them, therefore they will not ask one another. (* They will forget at that moment).
So whoever repented and accepted faith and did good deeds, so it is likely that he will be among the successful.
And your Lord creates whatever He wills, and chooses; they do not have any power to choose; Purity and Supremacy are to Allah above their ascribing partners (to Him).
And your Lord knows what is hidden in their breasts, and what they disclose.
And He is Allah – there is no God except Him; only His is the praise in this world and in the Hereafter; and only His is the command, and it is towards Him that you will be returned.
Proclaim, “What is your opinion – if Allah makes it night continuously for you till the Day of Resurrection then, other than Allah, who is the God who could bring you light?
So do you not heed?”
Say, “What is your opinion – if Allah makes it day continuously for you till the Day of Resurrection then, other than Allah, who is the God who could bring you night for you to rest during it?
So do you not perceive?”
And with His mercy He made the night and day for you, so that you may rest during the night and seek His munificence during the day, and for you to be thankful.
On the day when He will call to them – He will therefore proclaim, “Where are those partners of Mine, whom you had assumed?”
And We shall proclaim taking out a witness from each group, “Bring your proof” – so they will realise that the Truth (Right) is for Allah, and they will lose all that they had fabricated.
Indeed Qaroon was from the people of Moosa – he then oppressed them; and We gave him so many treasures that their keys were a heavy burden for a strong group; when his people said to him, “Do not show off – indeed Allah does not like the boastful.”
“And seek the abode of the Hereafter with the wealth that Allah has given you, and do not forget your part in this world, and do favours (to others) the way Allah has favoured you, and do not seek to cause turmoil in the earth; indeed Allah does not like the mischievous.”
He said, “I got this only due to a knowledge I have”; and does he not know that before him Allah destroyed the generations who were stronger than him and more in number?
And there is no questioning of the guilty regarding their sins.
He therefore came before his people in his pomp; said those who desired the worldly life, “If only we were to get what Qaroon has been given – he is indeed very fortunate.”
And said those who were given the knowledge, “Woe to you – the reward of Allah is better for one who accepts faith and does good deeds; and only those who are patient will receive it.”
We therefore buried him and his house into the earth; so he had no group to help save him from Allah; nor could he take revenge.
And those who had the day before desired his status, said in the morning, “It is strange – Allah expands the sustenance for whomever He wills among His bondmen, and restricts it; if Allah had not been gracious to us He would have buried us too; strangely, the disbelievers do not prosper.”
This abode of the Hereafter – We make it for those who do not wish greatness in the land nor turmoil; and the Hereafter is only for the pious.
Whoever brings virtue, for him is better than it; and whoever brings evil – so those who commit evil will not be repaid except to the extent of their deeds.
Indeed He Who has ordained the Qur’an upon you, will surely bring you back to where you wish; proclaim, “My Lord well knows him who came with guidance, and him who is in open error.”
And you held no expectations of the Book being sent down upon you, except that it is a mercy from your Lord – therefore never support the disbelievers. (You did not crave for it but trusted in the mercy of your Lord).
And never may they prevent you from the verses of Allah after they have been sent down upon you, and call towards your Lord, and never be among those who ascribe partners (to Him).
And do not worship any other God along with Allah; there is no God except Him; all things are destructible except His Entity; only His is the command, and it is towards Him that you will be returned.
Alif-Lam-Meem. (Alphabets of the Arabic language – Allah and to whomever He reveals, know their precise meanings.)
Do men fancy that they will be left just upon their declaring, “We believe”, and they will not be tested?
We indeed tested those before them – so Allah will surely test the truthful, and will surely test the liars.
Or do they who commit evil deeds imagine that they can escape from Us?
What an evil judgement they impose!
Whoever expects to meet Allah – then indeed the time appointed by Allah will come; and He is the All Hearing, the All Knowing.
And whoever strives in Allah's cause, strives only for his own benefit; indeed Allah is Independent of the entire creation.
And those who accepted faith and did good deeds – We will indeed relieve their sins and reward them for the best of their deeds.
And upon man We ordained kindness towards parents; and if they strive to make you ascribe a partner with Me, about which you do not have any knowledge, then do not obey them; towards Me only is your return and I will tell you what you used to do.
And those who accepted faith and did good deeds – We shall indeed include them among the virtuous.
And some people say, “We believe in Allah” – so if they are afflicted with some adversity in Allah’s way, they consider the chaos created by men as the punishment from Allah; and if the help comes from your Lord, they will surely say, “Indeed we were with you”; does not Allah well know what is in the hearts of the entire creation?
And indeed Allah will make known the believers, and indeed He will expose the hypocrites.
And the disbelievers said to the Muslims, “Follow our path and we will bear your sins”; whereas they will not bear anything from their sins; they are indeed liars.
And they will surely bear their own burdens and some other burdens along with their own; and they will undoubtedly be questioned on the Day of Resurrection concerning what they had fabricated.
And indeed We sent Nooh to his people – he therefore stayed with them for a thousand years, less fifty; so the flood seized them, and they were unjust.
And We rescued him and the people aboard the ship, and made the ship a sign for the entire world.
And (remember) Ibrahim – when he said to his people, “Worship Allah and fear Him; that is better for you, if you knew!”
“You worship only idols instead of Allah, and only forge a clear lie; indeed those whom you worship instead of Allah do not control your sustenance – therefore seek your sustenance from Allah, and worship Him, and be grateful to Him; it is towards Him that you will be returned.”
“And if you deny, then many nations have denied before you; and the Noble Messenger is not responsible except to plainly convey (the message).”
Have they not seen how Allah initiates the creation, then will create it again?
Indeed that is easy for Allah.
Proclaim (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “Travel in the land and see how He creates for the first time, then Allah brings forth the next development; indeed Allah is Able to do all things.”
He punishes whomever He wills and has mercy upon whomever He wills; and towards Him only you are to return.
Neither can you escape (from His control) in the earth nor in the sky; and for you, other than Allah, there is neither a friend nor a supporter.
And those who did not believe in My signs and in meeting Me, are those who have no hope of My mercy, and for them is a painful punishment.
So his people could not answer him except to say, “Kill him or burn him” – so Allah rescued him from the fire; indeed in this are signs for people who believe.
And Ibrahim said, “You have chosen only idols instead of Allah, with whom your friendship is only in the life of this world; then on the Day of Resurrection you will deny and curse each other; and the destination for all of you is hell, and you do not have supporters.”
So Lut believed in him; and Ibrahim said, “I migrate towards my Lord; indeed only He is the Almighty, the Wise.”
And We bestowed Ishaq and Yaqub to him, and kept the Prophethood and the Book among his descendants, and We gave him his reward in the world; and in the Hereafter he is indeed among those who deserve Our proximity.
And We rescued Lut when he said to his people, “You indeed commit the shameful; such that no one in the creation has ever done before you.”
“What! You commit the immoral with males, and cut off the roads; and you speak evilly in your gatherings?”
So his people had no answer except to say, “Bring the punishment of Allah upon us if you are truthful!”
He submitted, “My Lord! Help me against these mischievous people.”
And when Our sent angels came with glad tidings to Ibrahim, they said, “We will surely destroy the people of that town; indeed its inhabitants are unjust.”
He said, "Lut is in it!”; they said, “We know very well who all are there; we shall rescue him and his family, except his wife; she is of those who will stay behind.”
And when Our sent angels came to Lut, he was unhappy at their arrival and was depressed – and they said, “Do not fear or grieve; we will surely rescue you and your family, except your wife, who is of those who will stay behind.”
“We will indeed cause a punishment from the sky to descend upon the inhabitants of this town – the recompense of their disobedience.”
And We have undoubtedly kept a part of it as a clear sign for people of intellect.
And We sent towards Madyan, their fellowman Shuaib – he therefore said, “O my people! Worship Allah, and anticipate the Last Day, and do not roam the earth spreading turmoil.”
In response they denied him – thereupon the earthquake seized them – so at morning they remained lying flattened in their homes.
And We destroyed the A’ad and the Thamud, and you already know their dwellings; Satan made their deeds appear good to them and prevented them from the path, whereas they could perceive.
And (We destroyed) Qaroon, Firaun and Haman; and indeed Moosa came to them with clear signs, so they were arrogant in the land, and they could never escape from Our control.
So We caught each one upon his sin; so among them is one upon whom We sent a shower of stones; and among them is one who was seized by the Scream; and among them is one whom We buried in the earth, and among them is one whom We drowned; it did not befit Allah’s Majesty to oppress them, but they were wronging themselves.
The example of those who choose masters other than Allah is like that of the spider; it makes the web its house; and indeed the weakest house of all is that of the spider; if only they knew.
Allah knows what they worship instead of Him; He is the Almighty, the Wise.
And We illustrate these examples for mankind; and none except the knowledgeable understand them.
Allah created the heavens and the earth with the truth; indeed in this is a sign for the Muslims.
O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), recite from the Book which has been sent down to you, and establish the prayer; indeed the prayer stops from indecency and evil; and indeed the remembrance of Allah is the greatest; and Allah knows all what you do.
And O Muslims, do not argue with the People given the Book(s) except in the best manner – except (with) those among them who oppress, and say, “We believe in what has been sent down towards us and what has been sent towards you – and ours and your God is One, and we have submitted ourselves to Him.”
And this is how We sent down the Book to you O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him); so those to whom We gave the Book believe in it; and some of these (polytheists) accept faith in it; and none except the disbelievers reject Our signs.
And you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) were not reading any Book before it, nor writing with your right hand – if it were, the people of falsehood would surely have doubted.
In fact they are clear verses in the hearts of those who have been given knowledge; and none deny Our verses except the unjust.
And they said, “Why did not signs come down to him from his Lord?”
Say, “Signs are only with Allah; and I am purely a Herald of plain warning.”
Is it not enough for them that We have sent down the Book upon you, which is read to them?
Indeed in it are mercy and advice for the Muslims.
Proclaim (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “Allah is Sufficient as a Witness between me and you; He knows all what is in the heavens and in the earth; and those who accepted faith in falsehood and denied faith in Allah – it is they who are the losers.”
And they urge you to hasten the punishment; and if a time had not been fixed, the punishment would have certainly come upon them; and it will indeed come upon them suddenly whilst they are unaware.
They urge you to hasten the punishment; and indeed hell has encompassed the disbelievers.
The day when the punishment will envelop them from above them and from below their feet, and He will say, “Taste the flavour of your deeds!”
O My bondmen who believe! Indeed My earth is spacious – therefore worship Me alone.
Every soul must taste death; then it is to Us that you will return.
And those who believed and did good deeds – indeed We will, surely, place them on high positions in Paradise beneath which rivers flow, abiding in it for ever; what an excellent reward of the performers!
Those who patiently endured and who rely only upon their Lord.
And many creatures walk upon the earth that do not carry their own sustenance; Allah provides the sustenance to them and to you; and only He is the All Hearing, the All Knowing.
And if you ask them, “Who created the heavens and the earth, and subjected the sun and the moon?”, they will surely say, “Allah”; so where are they reverting?
Allah eases the sustenance for whomever He wills among His bondmen, and restricts it for whomever He wills; indeed Allah knows all things.
And if you ask them, “Who sent down the water from the sky, and with it revived the earth after its death?”, they will surely say, “Allah”; proclaim, “All praise is to Allah”; in fact most of them do not have any sense.
And this worldly life is nothing but pastime and game; indeed the abode of the Hereafter – that is indeed the true life; if only they knew.
And when they board the ships they pray to Allah, believing purely in Him; so when He delivers them safely to land, they immediately begin ascribing partners (to Him)!
In order to be ungrateful for Our favours; and to use the comforts; therefore they will soon come to know.
Did they not observe that We have created a refuge in the Sacred Land, and people around them are snatched away?
So do they believe in falsehood and are ungrateful for the favours of Allah?
And who is more unjust than one who fabricates lies against Allah, or denies the truth* when it comes to him?
Is there not a place in hell for disbelievers? (* The Holy Prophet and / or the Holy Qur’an).
And those who strove in Our way – We shall surely show them Our paths; and indeed Allah is with the virtuous.
Alif-Laam-Meem. (Alphabets of the Arabic language – Allah, and to whomever He reveals, know their precise meanings.)
The Romans have been defeated.
In the nearby land, and after their defeat they will soon be victorious.
Within a few (up to nine) years time; only for Allah is the command, before and after; and the believers will rejoice on that day.
With the help of Allah; He helps whomever He wills; and only He is the Almighty, the Most Merciful.
The promise of Allah; Allah does not renege on His promise, but most people do not know.
They know only the visible worldly life; and are totally neglectful of the Hereafter.
Have they not inwardly pondered – that Allah has not created the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them, except with truth and a fixed term?
And indeed many people deny the meeting with their Lord.
And did they not travel in the land to see what sort of fate befell those before them?
They were stronger than them, and they cultivated the land and inhabited it more than them, and their Noble Messengers came to them with clear proofs; so it did not befit Allah’s Majesty to oppress them, but it was they who used to wrong themselves.
Then the fate of those who committed evil to the extreme was that they denied the signs of Allah and used to mock at them.
Allah initiates the creation, then will create it again – then it is to Him that you will return.
And on the Last Day– when it is established, the guilty* will lose all hope. (* The disbelievers.)
And the partners they ascribed will not be their intercessors – and they will deny their partners.
And on the Last Day – that day they will all separate.
So those who believed and did good deeds – they will be hosted in the Garden.
And those who disbelieved, and denied Our signs and confronting the Hereafter – they will be hauled into the punishment.
So proclaim the Purity of Allah when you witness the night and the morning.
And only His is the praise in the heavens and the earth – and before the day ends and at noon.
He brings forth the living from the dead, and brings forth the dead from the living, and He revives the earth after its death; and this how you will be raised.
And among His signs is that He created you from dust, and therefore you are human beings spread in the earth.
And among His signs is that He created spouses for you from yourselves for you to gain rest from them, and kept love and mercy between yourselves; indeed in this are signs for the people who ponder.
And among His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the differences in your languages and colours; indeed in this are signs for people who know.
And among His signs is your sleeping during the night and day, and your seeking His munificence; indeed in this are signs for people who heed.
And among His signs is that He shows you the lightning, instilling fear and hope, and sends down water from the sky, so revives the earth after its death; indeed in this are signs for people of intellect.
And among His signs is that the heavens and the earth remain established by His command; then when He calls you – from the earth – you will thereupon emerge.
And to Him only belong all those who are in the heavens and the earth; all are submissive to Him.
And it is He Who initiates the creation, and will then create it again – and this, according to you, should be easier for Him!
And for Him only is the Supreme Majesty in the heavens and the earth; and only He is the Almighty, the Wise.
He illustrates an example for you from your own selves; do you have for yourselves, among the bondmen you possess, partners in the sustenance We have bestowed upon you, thereby you become equal in respect of it – you fearing them the way you fear each other?
This is how We illustrate detailed signs for the people of intellect.
Rather the unjust followed their own desires, without knowledge; so who can guide one whom Allah has sent astray?
And they do not have supporters.
Therefore set your attention for obeying Allah, devoted solely to Him; the foundation set by Allah, upon which He created man; do not change what Allah has created; this is the proper religion – but most people do not know.
Inclining towards Him – and fear Him, and keep the prayer established, and never be of the polytheists.
Those who broke their religion into several parts and became different groups; every group is happy with what it has.
And when some affliction reaches men, they pray to their Lord inclining towards Him – and when He gives them a taste of His mercy, thereupon a group among them begins setting up partners to their Lord!
In order to be ungrateful for Our bestowal; “Therefore enjoy”; you will soon come to know.
Or have We sent down to them any proof, which therefore tells them of My partners?
And when We give people the taste of mercy they rejoice at it; and if an ill fortune reaches them because of what their hands have sent ahead – thereupon they lose hope!
And did they not see that Allah eases the sustenance for whomever He wills and restricts it for whomever He wills?
Indeed in this are signs for people who believe.
Therefore give the relative his right, and to the needy, and to the traveller; this is better for those who seek the pleasure of Allah; and it is they who are the successful.
And that which you give upon usury, in order that it may increase the creditors’ property, will not increase before Allah; and the charity you give seeking the pleasure of Allah – only that will increase manifold.
It is Allah Who created you and then provided you sustenance, then will cause you to die, and will then give you life again; is there any among your ascribed partners that can do any of these things?
Purity and Supremacy are to Him, above their ascribing of partners (to Him)!
Chaos appears in the land and the sea because of the evil deeds which people’s hands have earned, in order to make them taste the flavour of some of their misdeeds – in order that they may come back.
Proclaim (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “Travel in the land, and see what sort of fate befell the former people; and most of them were polytheists.”
Therefore set your attention for worshipping, before the day from Allah which cannot be averted – on that day people will be split, separated.
Whoever disbelieves, then the calamity of his disbelief is only on him; and those who do good deeds, are preparing for themselves.
In order to reward those who believed and did good deeds, by His munificence; indeed He does not like the disbelievers.
And among His signs is that He sends winds heralding glad tidings, to make you taste His mercy, and so that the ships may sail by His command, and so that you may seek His munificence, and for you to give thanks.
And indeed We sent several Noble Messengers before you, to their nations – so they came to them with clear signs – We therefore took revenge from the guilty; and it is incumbent upon Our mercy, to help the Muslims.
It is Allah Who sends the winds raising the clouds – therefore spreads them in the sky as He wills and shatters them – so you see the rain dropping from inside it; so when He delivers it upon whomever He wills among His bondmen, thereupon they rejoice.
Although they had lost hope before it was sent down upon them.
Therefore observe the result of Allah’s mercy, how He revives the earth after its death; He will indeed resurrect the dead; and He is Able to do all things.
And if We send a wind and they see their fields yellow because of it, then indeed they would become ungrateful after it.
For you do not make the dead hear nor make the deaf hear the call when they flee, turning back. (The disbelievers are referred to as dead and deaf.)
Nor do you guide the blind out of their error; you only make those hear who believe in Our signs, so they have submitted. (The disbelievers are referred to as blind.)
It is Allah Who created you weak, then after weakness gave you strength, then after strength gave you weakness and old age; He creates whatever He wills; and only He is the All Knowing, the Able.
And on the day when the Last Day is established, the guilty will swear that they did not stay except for an hour; this is how they keep straying.
And said those who received knowledge and faith, “You have indeed stayed in the decree of Allah until the Day of Restoration; so this is the Day of Restoration, but you did not know.”
So on that day the unjust will not benefit from their excuses, nor will anyone ask them for compensation.
And indeed We have illustrated all kinds of examples in this Qur’an for mankind; and indeed if you bring a sign to them, the disbelievers will say, “You are upon nothing but falsehood.”
This is how Allah sets seal upon the hearts of the ignorant.
Therefore patiently endure, indeed the promise of Allah is true; and may not those who do not have faith make you impatient.
Alif-Lam-Meem. (Alphabets of the Arabic language – Allah, and to whomever He reveals, know their precise meanings.)
These are verses of the wise Book.
Guidance and mercy for the righteous.
Those who keep the prayer established and pay the charity and accept faith in the Hereafter.
It is they who are on guidance from their Lord, and only they are the successful.
And some people buy words of play, in order to mislead from Allah’s path, without knowledge; and to make it an article of mockery; for them is a disgraceful punishment.
And when Our verses are recited to him he haughtily turns away as if he did not hear them – as if there is deafness in his ears; so give him the glad tidings of a painful punishment.
Indeed those who believed and did good deeds – for them are Gardens of serenity.
In which they will abide; it is a true promise of Allah; and only He is the Almighty, the Wise.
He created the heavens without any supports visible to you, and cast mountains as anchors into the earth so that it may not shake with you, and spread all kinds of beasts in it; and We sent down water from the sky so thereby grew all kinds of refined pairs in it.
Allah has created this – therefore show me what has been created by those other than Him; in fact the unjust are in open error.
And indeed We bestowed wisdom to Luqman (saying) that, “Be grateful to Allah”; and whoever is grateful, is grateful for his own good; and whoever is ungrateful – then indeed Allah is the Absolute, the Most Praiseworthy.
And remember when Luqman said to his son, and he used to advise him, “O my son! Never ascribe anything as a partner to Allah; indeed ascribing partners to Him is a tremendous injustice.”
And We ordained upon man concerning his parents; his mother bore him enduring weakness upon weakness, and his suckling is up to two years – therefore be thankful to Me and to your parents; finally towards Me is the return.
And if they force you, that you ascribe a partner to Me a thing concerning which you do not have knowledge – so do not obey them and support them well in the world; and follow the path of one who has inclined towards Me; then towards Me only is your return, and I shall tell you what you used to do.
“O my son! If the evil deed is equal to the weight of a mustard-seed, and even if it is in a rock, or in the heavens, or wherever in the earth, Allah will bring it forth; indeed Allah knows all the minutest things, the All Aware.”
“O my son! Keep the prayer established, and enjoin goodness and forbid from evil, and be patient upon the calamity that befalls you; indeed these are acts of great courage.”
“And do not contort your cheek while talking to anyone, nor boastfully walk upon the earth; indeed Allah does not like any boastful, haughty person.”
“And walk moderately and soften your voice; indeed the worst voice is the voice of the donkey.”
Did you not see that Allah has made all whatever is in the heavens and all whatever is in the earth, subservient for you and bestowed His favours upon you in full, both visible and hidden?
And some men argue regarding Allah, with neither knowledge, nor guidance, nor a clear Book!
And when it is said to them, “Follow what Allah has sent down”, they say, “On the contrary, we shall only follow that upon which we found our forefathers”; even if the devil was calling them to the punishment of hell?
Whoever submits his face to Allah and is righteous – so he has indeed grasped the firm knot; and towards Allah only is the culmination of all things.
And whoever disbelieves – then do not be aggrieved by his disbelief (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him); they have to return to Us, and We will inform them what they were doing; indeed Allah knows what lies within the hearts.
We shall give them some usage, then making them helpless take them towards a severe punishment.
And if you ask them, “Who created the heavens and the earth?” – they will surely answer, “Allah”; proclaim, “All Praise is to Allah”; in fact most of them do not know.
To Allah only belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and in the earth; indeed Allah only is the Absolute, the Most Praiseworthy.
And if all the trees in the earth were pens, and the seas were its ink, with seven more seas to back it up – the Words of Allah will not finish; indeed Allah is Almighty, Wise.
Creating you all and raising you from the dead are like that of one soul*; indeed Allah is All Hearing, All Knowing.
(He can create you slowly or all at once).
O listener, did you not see that Allah brings the night in a part of the day and brings the day in a part of the night, and that He has subjected the sun and the moon – each one runs for its fixed term – and that Allah is Well Aware of your deeds?
This is because only Allah is the Truth, and all that they worship besides Him are falsehood, and because only Allah is the Supreme, the Great.
Did you not see that the ship sails on the sea by Allah’s grace, so that He may show you some of His signs?
Indeed in this are signs for every greatly enduring, grateful person.
And if a wave comes upon them like mountains, they pray to Allah believing purely in Him; then when He brings them safely to land, some of them remain upon justice; and none will deny Our signs except an extremely unfaithful, ungrateful person.
O mankind! Fear your Lord, and fear the Day in which no father will benefit his child; nor will any good child be of any benefit to the father; indeed Allah’s promise is true; so never may the worldly life deceive you; and never may the great cheat deceive you in respect of Allah’s commands.
Indeed Allah has the knowledge of the Last Day!
And He sends down the rain; and He knows all what is in the mothers’ wombs; and no soul knows what it will earn tomorrow; and no soul knows the place where it will die; indeed Allah is the All Knowing, the Informer.
(He may reveal the knowledge to whomever He wills.)
Alif-Lam-Meem. (Alphabets of the Arabic language – Allah and to whomever He reveals, know their precise meanings.)
The revelation of the Book is, without doubt, from the Lord Of The Creation.
What! They dare say that, “He has fabricated it”?
In fact it is the Truth from your Lord, in order that you warn a nation towards whom no Herald of Warning came before you, in the hope of their attaining guidance.
It is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth, and all what is between them, in six days, then (befitting His Majesty) established Himself over the Throne (of control); leaving Allah, there is neither a friend nor an intercessor for you; so do you not ponder?
He plans (all) the job(s) from the heaven to the earth – then it will return to Him on the Day which amounts to a thousand years in your count.
This is the All Knowing – of all the hidden and the visible, the Most Honourable, the Most Merciful.
The One Who created all things excellent, and Who initiated the creation of man from clay.
Then kept his posterity with a part of an abject fluid.
Then made him proper and blew into him a spirit from Him, and bestowed ears and eyes and hearts to you; very little thanks do you offer!
And they said, “When we have mingled into the earth, will we be created again?”; in fact they disbelieve in the meeting with their Lord.
Proclaim, “The angel of death, who is appointed over you, causes you to die and then towards your Lord you will return.”
And if you see when the guilty will hang their heads before their Lord; “Our Lord! We have seen and heard, therefore send us back in order that we do good deeds – we are now convinced!”
And had We willed We would have given every soul its guidance, but My Word is decreed that I will certainly fill hell with these jinns and men, combined.
“Therefore taste the recompense of your forgetting the confronting of this day of yours; We have abandoned you – now taste the everlasting punishment, the recompense of your deeds!”
Only those believe in Our signs who, when they are reminded of them, fall down in prostration and proclaim the Purity of their Lord while praising Him, and are not conceited. (Command of prostration # 9).
Their sides stay detached from their beds and they pray to their Lord with fear and hope – and they spend from what We have bestowed upon them.
So no soul knows the comfort of the eyes that is kept hidden for them*; the reward of their deeds. (Paradise)
So will the believer ever be equal to the one who is lawless?
They are not equal!
Those who accepted faith and did good deeds – for them are the Gardens of (everlasting) stay; a welcome in return for what they did.
And those who are lawless – their destination is the fire; whenever they wish to come out of it, they will be returned into it, and it will be said to them, “Taste the punishment of the fire you used to deny!”
And We shall indeed make them taste the smaller punishment before the greater punishment, so that they may return.
And who is more unjust than one who is preached to from the verses his Lord, then he turns away from them?
We will indeed take revenge from the guilty.
And indeed We bestowed the Book to Moosa, therefore have no doubt in its acquisition, and made it a guidance for the Descendants of Israel.
And We made some leaders among them, guiding by Our command, when they had persevered; and they used to accept faith in Our signs.
Indeed your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning the matters in which they used to differ.
And did they not obtain guidance by the fact that We did destroy many generations before them, so now they walk in their houses?
Indeed in this are signs; so do they not heed?
And do they not see that We send the water to the barren land and produce crops with it, so their animals and they themselves eat from it?
So do they not perceive?
And they say, “When will this decision take place, if you are truthful?”
Proclaim, “On the Day of Decision*, the disbelievers will not benefit from their accepting faith, nor will they get respite.” (* Of death or of resurrection)
Therefore turn away from them and wait – indeed they too have to wait.
O Herald of the Hidden (the Prophet), continue to fear Allah and never listen to the disbelievers and the hypocrites; indeed Allah is All Knowing, Wise.
And keep following what is sent down to you from your Lord; O people!
Indeed Allah is seeing your deeds.
And trust Allah; and Allah is Sufficient as a Trustee.
Allah has not kept two hearts in the body of any man; nor has He made them your mothers those wives of yours, whom you declare to be your mothers; nor has He made them your sons, whom you have adopted; this is the statement of your mouths; and Allah proclaims the truth and it is He Who shows the path.
Call them with their fathers’ names – this is more suitable in the sight of Allah; and if you do not know their fathers, then they are your brothers in the faith, (and your cousins as humans) and your friends; and there is no sin upon you for what you did unknowingly in the past – however it is a sin what you do with your heart’s intention; and Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
The Prophet is closer to the Muslims than their own lives, and his wives are their mothers; and the relatives are closer to each other in the Book of Allah, than other Muslims and immigrants, except that you may be kind towards your friends; this is written in the Book.
And remember O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) when We took a covenant from the Prophets – and from you – and from Nooh, and Ibrahim, and Moosa, and Eisa the son of Maryam; and We took a firm covenant from them.
So that He may question the truthful regarding their truth; and He has kept prepared a painful punishment for the disbelievers.
O People who believe!
Remember the favour of Allah upon you when some armies came against you, so We sent against them a windstorm and the armies you could not see; and Allah sees your deeds.
When the disbelievers came upon you from above you and from below you, and when the eyes became fixed in stare and the hearts came up to the throats, and you were imagining matters regarding Allah.
That proved be the testing ground for the Muslims, and they were subjected to a severe shake.
And when the hypocrites, and those in whose hearts is a disease, began saying, “Allah and His Noble Messenger have not given us a promise except one of deceit.”
And when a group among said, “O people of Medinah!
This is no place of stay for you, therefore go back to your homes”; and a group among them sought exemption from the Prophet by saying, “Our homes are unprotected” whereas their homes were not unprotected; they willed nothing except to flee.
And if the armies had come upon them from the outskirts of Medinah and demanded disbelief from them, they would certainly have given them their demand and would not have hesitated in it except a little.
And indeed before this they had agreed with Allah that they would not turn their backs; and the covenant of Allah will be questioned about.
Proclaim, “Fleeing will never benefit you if you flee from death or killing, and even then you will not be given the usage of this world except a little.”
Say, “Who is he who can avert the command of Allah from you, if He wills harm for you or wills to have mercy upon you?”
And other than Allah, they will not find any friend or supporter.
Indeed Allah knows those among you who prevent others from the holy war, and those who say to their brothers, “Come towards us”; and they do not come to fight, except a few.
They reduce the help towards you; so when a fearful time comes, you will observe them looking at you with eyes rolling like one enveloped by death; then when the time of fear is over, they begin slandering you with sharp tongues in their greed for the war booty; they have not accepted faith, therefore Allah has nullified their deeds; and this is easy for Allah.
They assume that the armies of the disbelievers have not gone away; and were the armies to come again, their wish would be to go out to the villages seeking information about you; and were they to stay among you even then they would not fight, except a few.
Indeed following the Noble Messenger of Allah is better for you – for one who is confident of Allah and the Last Day, and remembers Allah much.
And when the Muslims saw the armies, they said, “This is what Allah and His Noble Messenger promised us, and Allah and His Noble Messenger have spoken the truth”; and it did not increase anything for them but faith and acceptance of Allah’s will.
Among the Muslims are the men who have proved true what they had covenanted with Allah; so among them is one who has already fulfilled his vow, and among them is one still waiting; and they have not changed a bit.
In order that Allah may reward the truthful for their truthfulness, and punish the hypocrites if He wills, or give them repentance; indeed Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
And Allah turned back the disbelievers in their hearts’ jealousy, gaining no good; and Allah sufficed the Muslims in their fight; and Allah is Almighty, Most Honourable.
And He brought down from their forts, the People given the Book(s) who had supported them, and instilled awe into their hearts – you slay a group among them and another group you make captive.
And He bequeathed you their lands and their houses and their wealth, and land that you have not yet set foot upon; and Allah is Able to do all things.
O Herald of the Hidden!
Say to your wives, “If you desire the worldly life and its adornment – therefore come, I shall give you wealth and a befitting release!”
“And if you desire Allah and His Noble Messenger and the abode of the Hereafter – then indeed Allah has kept prepared an immense reward for the virtuous among you.”
O the wives of the Prophet!
If any among you dares to commit an act contrary to decency, for her will be double the punishment of others; and this is easy for Allah.
And whoever among you remains obedient towards Allah and His Noble Messenger and does good deeds – We shall give her double the reward of others, and have kept prepared for her an honourable sustenance.
O the wives of the Prophet!
You are not like any other women – if you really fear Allah, do not speak softly lest the one in whose heart is a disease have any inclination, and speak fairly.
And remain in your houses and do not unveil yourselves like the unveiling prevalent in the times of ignorance, and keep the prayer established, and pay the charity, and obey Allah and His Noble Messenger; Allah only wills to remove all impurity from you, O the People of the Household, and by cleansing you make you utterly pure. (*The Holy Prophet’s household.)
And remember what is recited in your houses, from Allah’s verses and wisdom*; indeed Allah knows the minutest things, is All Aware. (The Holy Qur’an and the sayings- hadith – of the Holy Prophet.)
Indeed the Muslim men and Muslim women, and the believing men and the believing women, and the men who obey and the women who obey, and the truthful men and the truthful women, and the patient men and the patient women, and the humble men and the humble women, and charitable men and the charitable women, and the fasting men and the fasting women, and the men who guard their chastity and the women who guard their chastity, and the men who profusely remember Allah and the women who profusely remember Allah – for all of them, Allah has kept prepared forgiveness and an immense reward.
And no Muslim man or woman has any right in the affair, when Allah and His Noble Messenger have decreed a command regarding it; and whoever does not obey the command of Allah and His Noble Messenger, has indeed clearly gone very astray.
And O dear Prophet, remember when you said to him upon whom Allah has bestowed favour and you had bestowed favour, “Keep your wife with you, and fear Allah”, and you kept in your heart what Allah willed to make known, and you feared criticism from the people; and Allah has more right that you should fear Him; so when Zaid became unconcerned with her, We gave her to you in marriage, so that there may be no sin upon believers in respect of the wives of their adopted sons when they have become unconcerned with them; and the command of Allah must be carried out.
There is no blame upon the Prophet regarding the matter that Allah has decreed for him; it has been Allah’s tradition in those who passed before; and the command of Allah is a certain destiny.
Those who deliver the messages of Allah and fear Him, and do not fear anyone except Allah; and Allah is Sufficient to take account.
Mohammed (peace and blessings be upon him) is not the father of any man among you – but he is the Noble Messenger of Allah and the Last of the Prophets*; and Allah knows all things. (* Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him – is the Last Prophet. There can be no new Prophet after him).
O People who Believe!
Remember Allah profusely.
And proclaim His Purity, morning and evening.
It is He Who sends blessings upon you*, and so do His angels, so that He may bring you out from darkness into light; and He is Most Merciful upon the Muslims. (* Upon the companions of the Holy Prophet).
For them the salutation upon their meeting* is “Peace”; and an honourable reward is kept prepared for them. (* Upon death / while entering Paradise / meeting with Allah).
O Herald of the Hidden! We have indeed sent you as an observing present witness and a Herald of glad tidings and warning.
And as a caller towards Allah, by His command, and as a sun that enlightens. (The Holy Prophet is a light from Allah.)
And give glad tidings to the believers that for them is Allah’s extreme munificence.
And do not please the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and overlook the pain they cause and rely upon Allah; and Allah suffices as a Trustee.
O People who Believe!
If you marry Muslim women and divorce them without having touched them, so for you there is no waiting period for the women, which you may count; therefore give them some benefit and release them with a proper release.
O Herald of the Hidden! We have indeed made lawful for you the wives to whom you have paid their bridal money, and the bondwomen you possess whom Allah gave you as war booty, and the daughters of your paternal uncles, and the daughters of your paternal aunts, and the daughters of your maternal uncles, and the daughters of your maternal aunts, those who migrated with you; and the believing woman if she gifts her life to the Prophet, if the Prophet desires to take her in marriage; this is exclusively for you, not for your followers; We indeed know what We have enjoined upon the Muslims concerning their wives and the bondwomen they possess – this exclusivity for you is so that you may not have constraints; and Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
Put back in the order whom you wish among them and give your proximity to whomever you wish; and if you incline towards one whom you had set aside, there is no sin upon you in it; this command is closer to their eyes remaining soothed and not grieving, and all of them remaining happy with whatever you give them; and Allah knows what is in the hearts of you all; and Allah is All Knowing, Most Forbearing.
Other women are not permitted for you after these, nor that you change them for other wives even if their beauty pleases you except the bondwomen whom you possess; and Allah is the Guardian over all things.
O People who Believe! Do not enter the houses of the Prophet without permission, as when called for a meal but not to linger around waiting for it – and if you are invited then certainly present yourself and when you have eaten, disperse – not staying around delighting in conversation; indeed that was causing harassment to the Prophet, and he was having regard for you; and Allah does not shy in proclaiming the truth; and when you ask the wives of the Prophet for anything to use, ask for it from behind a curtain; this is purer for your hearts and for their hearts; and you have no right to trouble the Noble Messenger of Allah, nor ever marry any of his wives after him; indeed that is a very severe matter in the sight of Allah. (To honour the Holy Prophet – peace and blessings be upon him – is part of faith. To disrespect him is blasphemy.)
Whether you disclose a thing or keep it hidden – then indeed Allah knows all things.
There is no sin upon your wives in (dealing with) their fathers, or their sons, or their brothers, or their brothers’ sons, or their sisters’ sons or women of their own religion, or their bondwomen; and O women, keep fearing Allah; indeed all things are present in front of Allah.
Indeed Allah and His angels send blessings on the Prophet; O People who Believe!
Send blessings and abundant salutations upon him. (Everlasting peace and unlimited blessings be upon the Holy Prophet Mohammed.)
Indeed those who trouble Allah and His Noble Messenger – upon them is Allah’s curse in the world and in the Hereafter, and Allah has kept prepared a disgraceful punishment for them. (To disrespect / trouble the Holy Prophet – peace and blessings be upon him – is blasphemy.)
And those who unnecessarily harass Muslim men and women, have burdened themselves with slander and open sin.
O Prophet!
Command your wives and your daughters and the women of the Muslims to cover their faces with a part of their cloaks; this is closer to their being recognised and not being harassed; and Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
(It is incumbent upon women to cover themselves properly.)
If the hypocrites, and those in whose hearts is a disease, and the rumour mongers in Medinah do not desist, We shall then surely impel you against them, so then they will not remain your neighbours in Medinah except for a few days.
Accursed – to be caught wherever found and to be slain thoroughly.
The tradition of Allah prevalent among those who passed away before; and you will never find the traditions of Allah changing.
People ask you regarding the Last Day; proclaim, “Its knowledge is only with Allah; and what do you know, the Last Day may really be near!”
Allah has indeed cursed the disbelievers, and has kept prepared for them a blazing fire.
In which they will remain forever; in it they will find neither a protector nor any supporter.
On the day when their faces will be overturned being roasted inside the fire, they will say, “Alas – if only we had obeyed Allah and obeyed His Noble Messenger!”
And they will say, “Our Lord! We followed our chiefs and our elders – so they misled us from the path!”
“Our Lord! Give them double the punishment of the fire and send upon them a mighty curse!”
O People who Believe!
Do not be like the people who troubled Moosa – so Allah freed him from the allegations they had uttered; and Moosa is honourable in the sight of Allah.
O People who Believe!
Fear Allah, and speak rightly.
He will rectify your deeds for you and forgive you your sins; and whoever obeys Allah and His Noble Messenger, has indeed achieved a great success.
We indeed offered the trust to the heavens and the earth and the mountains, but they refused it and were afraid of it – and man accepted it; indeed he is one who puts himself into hardship, is extremely unwise.
In order that Allah may punish the hypocrite men, and the hypocrite women, and the polytheist men, and the polytheist women – and accept the repentance of believing men and believing women; and Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
All praise is to Allah – to Him only belongs all whatever is in the heavens and all whatever is in the earth – and His is the praise in the Hereafter; and He is the Wise, the All Aware.
He knows all that goes into the earth and all that comes out of it, and all that descends from the skies and all that ascends into it; and only He is the Most Merciful, the Oft Forgiving.
And the disbelievers said, “The Last Day will never come upon us”; proclaim, “Surely yes, why not?
By oath of my Lord, it will surely come upon you – the All Knowing of the hidden; nothing is hidden from Him – equal to an atom or less than it or greater – in the heavens or in the earth, but it is in a clear Book.”
So that He may reward those who believed and did good deeds; it is these for whom is forgiveness, and an honourable sustenance.
And those who strove in Our signs in order to defeat – for them is a punishment from the severe painful punishments.
And those who received the knowledge know that what is sent down upon you from your Lord is the truth, and it shows the path of the Most Honourable, the Most Praiseworthy.
And the disbelievers said, “Shall we show you a man who will tell you that ‘When you have disintegrated into the smallest pieces, you are to be created again’?”
“Has he fabricated a lie against Allah, or is he insane?”
Rather those who disbelieve in the Hereafter are in the punishment and extreme error.
So did they not see what is before them and what is behind them in the sky and the earth?
If We will, We can bury them into the earth or cause a part of the sky to fall on them; indeed in this is a sign for every repentant bondman.
And indeed We gave Dawud the utmost excellence from Us; “O the hills and birds, repent towards Allah along with him”; and We made iron soft for him.
“Make large coats of armour and keep proper measure while making; and all of you perform good deeds; I am indeed seeing your deeds.”
And We gave the wind in Sulaiman’s control – its morning journey equal to a month’s course and the evening journey equal to a month’s course; and We sprung a stream of molten copper for him; and from the jinns, who worked before him by the command of his Lord; and those among them who turned away from Our command – We shall make them taste the punishment of the blazing fire.
They made for him whatever he wished – synagogues and statues, basins like ponds, and large pots built into the ground; “Be thankful, O the people of Dawud!”
And few among My bondmen are grateful.
So when We sent the command of death towards him, no one revealed his death to the jinns except the termite of the earth which ate his staff; and when he came to the ground, the truth about the jinns was exposed – if they had known the hidden, they would not have remained in the disgraceful toil.
Indeed for (the tribe of) Saba was a sign in their dwelling-place – two gardens on the right and the left; “Eat the sustenance provided by your Lord and be grateful to Him”; a pure land and an Oft Forgiving Lord!
In response they turned away – We therefore sent upon them a tremendous flood, and in exchange of their two gardens gave them two gardens bearing bitter fruit, and tamarisk, and some berries.
We gave them this reward – the recompense of their ingratitude; and whom do We punish, except the ungrateful?
And We had made several towns upon the road between them and the towns which We had blessed – and kept them according to the length of the journey; “Travel safely in them, by night and by day.”
So they said, “Our Lord!
Make the stage between our journeys longer” and they wronged themselves – We therefore turned them into fables and scattered them completely with adversity; indeed in this are signs for every greatly enduring, most grateful person.
And indeed Iblis made his assumptions regarding them seem true, so they all followed him except the group of Muslims.
And Satan had no control over them at all, except that We willed to reveal as to who believes in the Hereafter and who is in doubt of it; and your Lord is a Guardian over all things.
Proclaim, “Call those whom you assume (as Gods) besides Allah”; they do not own anything equal even to an atom either in the heavens or in the earth, nor do they have any share in them, nor is any one among them an aide to Allah.
And intercession does not benefit before Him, except for one whom He permits; to the extent that when the fear is removed from their hearts by giving permission, they say to each other, “How splendidly has your Lord spoken!”
They say, “All that He has proclaimed is the Truth; and He is the Supreme, the Great.”
Proclaim, “Who provides you sustenance from the sky and the earth?”
Proclaim, “Allah – and indeed either we or you are upon guidance, or in open error.”
Proclaim, “You will not be questioned regarding the sins you assume we have committed, nor will we be questioned regarding your misdeeds.”
Say, “Our Lord will bring us all together, and then judge truthfully between us; and He is the Best Judge, the All Knowing.”
Say, “(Dare you) Show me those whom you have matched with Him – never!
Rather only He is Allah, the Most Honourable, the Wise.”
And O dear Prophet, We have not sent you except with a Prophethood that covers the entire mankind, heralding glad tidings and warnings, but most people do not know. (Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him – is the Prophet towards all mankind.)
And they say, “When will this promise come, if you are truthful?
Proclaim “For you is the promise of a Day which you cannot postpone by one moment nor can you advance it.”
And the disbelievers said, “We shall never believe in this Qur’an nor in the Books that were before it”; and if only you see, when the unjust will be brought before their Lord; they will hurl allegations on one another; those who were subdued will say to those who were conceited, “If it were not for you, we would have certainly accepted faith.”
Those who were conceited will say to those who were subdued, “Did we stop you from the guidance after it came to you?
In fact you yourselves were guilty!”
Those who were subdued will say to those who were conceited, “Rather it was your deceit during night and day, for you commanded us to deny Allah and to set up equals to Him”; and inwardly they began regretting when they saw the punishment; and We placed shackles around the necks of the disbelievers; what recompense will they get except what they used to do?
And whenever We sent a Herald of Warning to any town, its wealthy people said, “We disbelieve in what you have been sent with.”
And they said, “We are greater in wealth and children; we will not be punished!”
Proclaim “Indeed my Lord eases the sustenance for whomever He wills and restricts it for whomever He wills, but most people do not know.”
And your wealth and your children are not capable of bringing you near to Us, but one who believes and did good deeds (is brought close); for them is double the reward – the recompense of their deeds and they are in high positions, in peace.
And those who strive in Our signs in order to defeat, will be brought into the punishment.
Say, “Indeed my Lord eases the sustenance for whomever He wills among His bondmen, and restricts it for whomever He wills; and whatever you spend in Allah's cause, He will restore it; and He is the Best Sustainer.”
And on the day when He will raise them all, and then say to the angels, “Did they worship you?”
They will say, “Purity is to you – only you are our Supporter, not they; in fact they worshipped the jinns; most of them believed only in them.”
So this day you will not have the power to benefit or hurt one another; and We shall say to the unjust, “Taste the punishment of the fire which you used to deny!”
And if Our clear verses are recited to them, they say, “He is nothing but a man who wishes to turn you away from the deities of your forefathers!”; and they say, “This is nothing but a fabricated lie”; and said the disbelievers regarding the truth when it reached them, “This is nothing but obvious magic.”
And We did not give them any Books which they may read, nor did We send to them any Herald of Warning before you.
And those before them had denied – and these have not reached even a tenth of what We had given them – so they denied My Noble Messengers; so how did My rejection turn out?
Proclaim, “I advise you just one thing; that stand up for Allah's sake, in twos and ones, and then think”; there is not a trace of insanity in this companion of yours; he is not but a Herald of Warning for you, before the advent of a severe punishment!
Say, “Whatever fee I might have asked from you upon this, is yours; my reward is only upon Allah; and He is Witness over all things.”
Proclaim, “Indeed my Lord sends down the truth; the All Knowing of all the hidden.”
Proclaim, “The truth has come, and falsehood dare not commence nor return.”
Proclaim, “If I stray, I stray only for my own harm; and if I attain guidance, it is because of what my Lord has sent down to me; indeed He is All Hearing, Close.”
And if only you see, when they will be forced into a terror from which they will be unable to escape, and are seized from a place nearby. (Wherever they go, they are never far).
And they will say, “We accept faith in it”; and how can they attain it from so far away?
(After they have crossed the limit of life allotted to them.)
For they had disbelieved in it before; and they hurl allegations without seeing, from far away.
And a barrier is set between them and what they desire*, as was done for their earlier groups; indeed they are in a doubt that deceives.
(To accept faith or return to earth)
All praise is to Allah, the Maker of the heavens and the earth, Who assigns angels as messengers – who have pairs of two, three, four wings; He increases in creation whatever He wills; indeed Allah is Able to do all things.
No one can withhold the mercy which Allah opens to mankind; and whatever He withholds – so after it, none can release it; and only He is the Most Honourable, the Wise.
O people! Remember the favour of Allah upon you; is there a Creator other than Allah who can provide you sustenance from the sky and the earth?
There is no God except Him; so where are you reverting?
And if they deny you, many Noble Messengers were denied before you; and towards Allah only is the return of all matters.
O people! Allah’s promise is indeed true; therefore do not ever let the worldly life deceive you; nor ever let the great cheat deceive you in respect of Allah’s commands.
Indeed Satan is your enemy, therefore you too take him as an enemy; he only calls his group so that they become the people of hell!
For the disbelievers is a severe punishment; and for those who accepted faith and did good deeds is forgiveness, and an immense reward.
So will one whose misdeeds are made seeming good to him – so he deems them good – be ever equal to the one who is upon guidance?
Therefore indeed Allah sends astray whomever He wills, and guides whomever He wills; so may not your life be lost in despairing after them; Allah knows their deeds very well.
And it is Allah Who sent the winds – so they raise clouds and We then direct it towards a dead city – so with it We revive the earth after its death; and this is how the resurrection will be.
Whoever desires honour – therefore all honour belongs to Allah!* Towards Him only ascends the pure good speech, and He raises high the pious deed; and for those who conspire evil is a severe punishment; and their own conspiracy will be destroyed.
(It is Allah Who bestows honour, to whomever He wills.)
And Allah created you from clay, then a drop of liquid, then made you as couples; and no female conceives or gives birth except with His knowledge; and every aged being that is given the age, and every one whose life is kept short – all this is in a Book; indeed this is easy for Allah.
And the two seas are not alike; this is sweet, very sweet and palatable – and this is salty, bitter; and from each you eat fresh meat and extract the ornament which you wear; and you see the ship cleaving through it, so that you may seek His munificence, and in some way become grateful.
He brings the night in a part of the day and He brings the day in a part of the night; and He has subjected the sun and moon; each one runs to its fixed term; such is Allah, your Lord – only His is the kingship; and those whom you worship instead of Him do not own even the husk of a date-seed.
If you call them, they do not hear your call; and supposedly if they heard it, they cannot fulfil your needs; and on the Day of Resurrection they will deny your ascribed partnership; and none will inform you like Him Who informs.
O people! You are dependant on Allah; and Allah only is the Independent (Absolute, Not Needing Anything), the Most Praiseworthy.
If He wills, He can take you away and bring other creatures.
And this not at all difficult for Allah.
And no burdened soul will carry another soul’s burden; and if a burdened soul calls another to share the burden, no one will carry any part of it, even if he is a close relative; O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), your warning only benefits those who fear their Lord without seeing and who keep the prayer established; and whoever cleansed himself, has cleansed for his own benefit; and towards Allah only is the return.
And the blind and the sighted are not equal!
And neither are darkness and brightness!
And neither are the shadow and the hot sunshine!
And not equal are the living and the dead!
Indeed Allah causes them to listen*, whomever He wills; and you cannot make those who are in the graves** listen. (* Listen to guidance **The disbelievers are referred to as dead, whose fates are sealed.)
You are purely a Herald of Warning.
And O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), We have indeed sent you with the Truth, giving glad tidings and heralding warnings; and there was a Herald of Warning in every group.
And if these disbelievers deny you, those before them had also denied; their Noble Messengers came to them with clear proofs and scriptures and the bright Book.
Then I seized the disbelievers; so how did denial My rejection turn out?
Have you not seen that it is Allah Who causes the water to descend from the sky?
So with it We have grown various colourful fruits; and among the mountains are tracks white and red, of different hues, and others dark black.
And similarly the colours of men and beasts and cattle, are different; among the bondmen of Allah, only the people of knowledge fear Him; indeed Allah is the Most Honourable, Oft Forgiving.
Indeed those who read the Book of Allah, and keep the prayer established, and spend from what We have bestowed upon them in secret and publicly, are hopeful of a trade in which there is never a loss.
In order that He may reward them with goodness in full, and further increase it with His munificence; indeed He is Oft Forgiving, Most Appreciative.
And the Book which We have divinely revealed to you – that is the Truth, confirming the Books which were before it; indeed Allah is Aware of His bondmen, All Seeing.
We then made Our chosen bondmen the inheritors of the Book; so among them is one who wrongs himself; and among them is one who stays on the middle course; and among them is one who, by the command of Allah, surpassed others in good deeds; this is the great favour!
They shall enter the Gardens of everlasting stay (Eden) – in which they shall be given to adorn armlets of gold and pearls; and their garment in it is silk.
And they will say; “All praise is to Allah Who has put away our grief; indeed Our Lord is Oft Forgiving, Most Appreciative.”
“The One Who has, by His munificence, established us in a place of serenity; in which no hardship shall ever reach us nor any fatigue affect us.”
And for those who disbelieved is the fire of hell; neither does their final seizure come that they may die, nor is its punishment lightened for them; this is how We punish every extremely ungrateful person.
And they shall be screaming in it; “Our Lord! Extricate us, so that we may do good deeds, the opposite of what we used to do”; (It will be said to them) “And did We not give you an age long enough, in which anyone who wants to understand would have understood?
And the Herald of Warning did come to you; therefore now taste it – for the unjust do not have any supporter.”
Indeed Allah is All Knowing – of all the hidden things in the heavens and in the earth; indeed He knows what lies within the hearts.
It is He Who has made you the successors of your predecessors in the earth; so whoever disbelieves – (the harm of) his disbelief falls only on him; and for the disbelievers, their disbelief increases nothing in their Lord’s sight except disgust; and for the disbelievers, their disbelief increases nothing for them except ruin.
Proclaim, “Just show me your partners (false deities) whom you worship other than Allah; show me which part of the earth have they created – or do they have any share in the heavens?”
Or have We given them some Book, so they are on its clear proofs?
In fact the unjust do not give promises to each other, except of deceit.
Indeed Allah restrains the heavens and the earth from convulsing; and were they to convulse, who could stop them except Allah?
Indeed He is Most Forbearing, Oft Forgiving.
And they swore by Allah most vehemently in their oaths, that if a Herald of Warning came to them, they would be more upon guidance than any other group; then when a Herald of Warning did come to them, he increased nothing in them except hatred.
Priding themselves in the earth and scheming evil; and the evil scheming falls only upon those who scheme it; so what are they waiting for, except the tradition of the earlier nations?
So you will never find the traditions of Allah changing; and you will never find Allah’s law being avoided.
And did they not travel in the land in order to see what sort of fate befell those who were before them, whereas they exceeded them in strength?
And Allah is not such that anything in the heavens or in the earth can break away from His control; indeed He is All Knowing, Able.
If Allah were to seize people upon their deeds, He would leave no creature walking on the surface of the earth, but He gives them respite till a fixed term; and when their term comes – so indeed Allah is observing all His bondmen!
Yaa-Seen (Alphabets of Arabic language – Allah and to whomever He reveals, know their precise meanings.)
By oath of the wise Qur’an.
You (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) are indeed one of the Noble Messengers.
On the Straight Path.
(The Qur’an is) Sent down by the Almighty, the Most Merciful.
So that you may warn these people whose ancestors were not warned, they are therefore unaware.
Undoubtedly, it (their disbelief) has proved true for most of them, so they will not believe.
We have indeed put shackles around their necks reaching up to the chins, so they remain facing upwards.
And We have set a wall before them and a wall behind them, and covered the top – so they are unable to see anything.
And it is the same for them, whether you warn them or do not warn them – they will not believe.
You warn only him who follows the advice and fears the Most Gracious without seeing; therefore give him glad tidings of forgiveness and an honourable reward.
We will surely bring the dead to life and We record what they send ahead and the signs they will leave behind; and We have accounted all things in a clear Book.
And relate to them the signs of the people of the city – when two emissaries came to them.
When We had sent two towards them and they denied them both, so We fortified them with a third, and they all said, “Indeed we have been sent to you.”
They said, “You are nothing but mortals like us; the Most Gracious has not sent down anything – you are nothing but liars.”
They answered, “Our Lord knows that surely, without doubt, we have been sent towards you.”
“And our duty is nothing but to plainly convey (the message).”
They (the people of the city) said, “We think you are ominous; indeed, if you do not desist, we shall surely stone you to death, and you will surely face a grievous torture at our hands.”
They said, “Your evil omens are with you!
What! You get annoyed for being advised?
In fact you are a people who transgress the limits!”
And from the outermost part of the city came a man running; he said, “O my people!
Obey those who have been sent.”
“Obey those who do not ask any fee from you, and they are on guidance.”
“And what is the matter with me that I should not worship Him Who created me, whereas it is towards Him that you are to return?”
“What! Shall I appoint Gods other than Allah?
So that if the Most Gracious should wish me any harm, their intercession would be of no use to me, nor would they be able to save me?”
“Undoubtedly, I am then in open error.”
“Indeed I have believed in your Lord, so heed me.”
It was said to him, “Enter Paradise”; he said, “If only my people knew!”
“The manner in which my Lord has pardoned me and made me of the honoured ones!”
And after him, We did not send down any army from heaven against his people, nor did We intend to send down an army.
It was just one scream, and with it they were extinguished.
And it was said, “Woe to those bondmen – whenever a Noble Messenger comes to them, they mock at him!”
Have they not seen how many generations We destroyed before them, which will not return to them?
And without exception, all of them will be brought forth before Us.
And a sign for them is the dead earth; We gave it life and We produced from it grain, so they eat from it.
And We have placed in it gardens of dates and grapes, and We have made springs of water in it.
So that they may eat from its fruits, whereas they are not manufactured by their hands!
So will they not be grateful?
Purity is to Him Who created all pairs, from what the earth grows, and of themselves, and from the things they do not know.
And a sign for them is the night; We strip the day out of it, thereupon they are in darkness.
And the sun runs its course for its final destination; this is a command of the Almighty, the All Knowing.
And We have appointed positions for the moon till it returns like an old branch of the date palm.
It is not for the sun to catch up with the moon, nor does the night surpass the day; and each one of them floats in its orbit.
And a sign for them is that We lodged them in a laden ship, while they were in their forefathers backs.
And We have created for them similar ships, in which they now ride.
And if We will, We can drown them, so there would be no help in their distress, nor would they be saved.
Unless by mercy from Us, and as a comfort for a while.
And when it is said to them, “Beware of what is before you and what is behind you, in the hope of your gaining mercy”, they turn away!
And whenever a sign comes to them from the signs of their Lord, they always turn away from it!
And when it is said to them, “Spend in Allah’s cause, from what Allah has provided you”, the disbelievers say regarding the believers, “Shall we feed these, whom if Allah willed, would have fed?
You are not but in open error!”
And they say, “When will this promise be fulfilled, if you are truthful?”
They await just one scream, which will overcome them while they are involved in worldly disputes.
Therefore neither able to make a will, nor returning to their homes.
And the Trumpet will be blown – so they will come forth from the graves, running towards their Lord.
Saying, “O our misfortune!
Who has raised us from our sleep?
This is what the Most Gracious had promised, and the Noble Messengers had spoken the truth!”
It is just one scream, and every one of them will be brought together before Us!
So this day no soul will be wronged in the least; and you will not be compensated except for your deeds.
Indeed this day the dwellers of Paradise are in comfort, with blissful hearts.
They and their wives are in shades, reclining on thrones.
In it (paradise) are fruits for them and whatever they ask for.
Upon them will be “Peace” – a Word from their Merciful Lord!
“And be separated (from others) this day, O you criminals!”
Did I not take a covenant from you that you shall not worship the devil? Undoubtedly, he is your open enemy.”
“And that you shall worship Me?
This is the Straight Path.”
“And he has indeed led a large number of you astray; so did you not have sense?”
“This is hell, which you were promised.”
“Enter it this day – the recompense of your disbelief.”
This day We will set a seal on their mouths, and their hands will speak out to Us and their feet will bear witness to their deeds.
And had We willed, We could have quenched their eyes so they would rush towards the path, unable to see a thing.
And had We willed, We could have disfigured their faces while they were in their homes, therefore unable to go forward or turn back.
And whomever We bring to an old age, We reverse him in creation; so do they not understand?
And We have not taught him (Prophet Mohammed- peace and blessings be upon him) to recite poetry, nor does it befit him; it is nothing but an advice and the bright Qur’an.
To warn the living*, and to prove the Word against disbelievers. (Only the believers are deemed alive in Allah’s sight.)
Did they not see that We have created animals for them from Our handiwork, so they are their owners?
And have subjected the animals for them, so they ride some animals and eat some?
And for them in the animals are numerous different benefits and drinks; so will they not be grateful?
And they have appointed Gods other than Allah, that perhaps they may be helped!
They (the appointed Gods) cannot help them; and they and their armies will come (to Us), as captives.
Therefore (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) do not grieve because of what they (the disbelievers) say; indeed We know what they conceal and what they disclose.
And did not man see that We have created him from a drop of semen?
Yet he is an open quarreller!
And he invents an example for Us, while forgetting his own creation, saying, “Who is such that can revive the bones when they have completely rotted away?”
Proclaim (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “They will be revived by the One Who created them the first time; and He is the All Knowing of every creation.”
“The One Who has created for you fire from the green tree, so you kindle from it.”
And is it not possible for the One Who created the heavens and the earth to create the likes of them? It is surely possible, why not?
And He is the Great Creator, the All Knowing of everything.
And His only task when He intends a thing is to command it, “Be” – and it thereupon happens!
Therefore Purity is to Him in Whose Hand* is the control over all things and it is towards Him that you will be returned. (Used as a metaphor to mean Power).
By oath of those who establish proper ranks.
And by oath of those who herd with a stern warning.
And by oath of the groups that read the Qur’an.
Indeed your God is surely only One.
Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them – and the Lord of the sun’s rising points.
We have indeed adorned the lowest heaven with stars as ornaments.
And to protect it from every rebellious devil.
They cannot listen to the speech of those on higher elevations and they are targeted from every side.
To make them flee, and for them is a never-ending punishment.
Except one who sometimes steals a part, so a blazing flame goes after him.
Therefore ask them (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “Are they a stronger creation, or are other things of our creation, (the angels, the heavens etc.)?”
We have indeed created them from sticky clay.
Rather you are surprised, whereas they keep mocking.
And they do not understand, when explained to.
And whenever they see a sign, they mock at it.
And they say, “This is nothing but clear magic.”
“When we are dead and have turned into dust and bones, will we certainly be raised again?”
“And also our forefathers?”
Proclaim, “Yes, and with disgrace.”
So that is just a single jolt, thereupon they will begin staring.
And will say, “O our misfortune!”
It will be said to them, “This is the Day of Justice.”
“This is the Day of Judgement, which you used to deny!”
“Gather all the unjust persons and their spouses, and all that they used to worship!” –
“Instead of Allah – and herd them to the path leading to hell.”
“And stop them – they are to be questioned.”
“What is the matter with you, that you do not help one another?”
In fact this day they have all surrendered.
And some of them inclined towards others, mutually questioning.
They said, “It is you who used to come to us from our right, in order to sway.”
They will answer, “You yourselves did not have faith!”
“And we did not have any control over you; but in fact you yourselves were rebellious.”
“So the Word of our Lord has proved true upon us; we will surely have to taste (the punishment).”
“We therefore led you astray, for we ourselves were astray!”
So this day they all are partners in the punishment.
This is how We deal with the guilty.
Indeed, when it was said to them, “There is no God except Allah”, they were haughty.
And they used to say, “Shall we forsake our Gods upon the sayings of a mad poet?”
In fact he has brought the Truth, and testified for the Noble Messengers!
“You surely have to taste the painful punishment.”
“And you will not be compensated except for your deeds.”
Except the chosen bondmen of Allah.
For them is the sustenance known to Us.
Fruits; and they will be honoured.
In Gardens of peace.
Facing one another on thrones.
Cups of wine will be presented to them in rounds, from a spring flowing in front of them.
White, delicious for the drinkers.
Neither does it intoxicate, nor give a headache.
And with them are those who do not set gaze upon men except their husbands, the maidens with gorgeous eyes.
As if they were eggs, safely hidden.
So one among them turns to the other, questioning. –
The speaker among them said, “I had a companion.” –
“Who used to tell me, ‘Do you believe it is true?’ –
‘That when we are dead and have turned into dust and bones, that we will either be rewarded or punished?’”
He said (to others on the thrones), “Will you take a glimpse (into hell) below?”
He therefore looked down and saw him amidst the blazing fire.
He said, “By Allah, you had nearly ruined me!”
“And were it not for the munificence of my Lord, I too would have been seized and brought forth (captive)!”
“So are we never to die?” (The people of Paradise will ask the angels, with delight, after the announcement of everlasting life.)
“Except our earlier death, and nor will we be punished?”
“This is, most certainly, the supreme success.”
For such a reward should the workers perform.
So is this welcome better, or the tree of Zaqqum?
We have indeed made that a punishment for the unjust.
Indeed it is a tree that sprouts from the base of hell.
Its fruit like the heads of demons.
So indeed they will eat from it, and fill their bellies with it.
Then after it, indeed for them is the drink of boiling hot water.
Then surely their return is towards hell.
They had indeed found their forefathers astray.
So they hastily follow their footsteps!
And indeed before them, most of the former people went astray.
And indeed We had sent Heralds of warnings among them.
Therefore see what sort of fate befell those who were warned!
Except the chosen bondmen of Allah.
And indeed Nooh prayed to Us – so what an excellent Acceptor of Prayer We are!
And We rescued him and his household from the great calamity.
And We preserved his descendants.
And We kept his praise among the latter generations.
Peace be upon Nooh, among the entire people.
This is how We reward the virtuous.
He is indeed one of Our high ranking, firmly believing bondmen.
We then drowned the others.
And indeed Ibrahim is from his (Nooh’s) group.
When he came to his Lord, with a sound heart. (Free from falsehood).
When he said to his father (paternal uncle) and his people, “What do you worship?”
“What! You desire, through fabrication, Gods other than Allah?”
“So what do you assume regarding the Lord Of The Creation?” (That He will not punish you?)
He then shot a glance at the stars.
He then said, “I feel sick (of you)!”
And they turned their backs on him and went away. (The pagans thought he would transmit the disease).
He then sneaked upon their deities and said, “Do you not eat?”
“What is the matter with you, that you do not say anything?”
He then began striking them with his right hand, unseen by the people.
So the disbelievers came running towards him.
He said, “What! You worship what you yourselves have sculpted?”
“Whereas Allah has created you and your actions?”
They said, “Construct a building (furnace) for him, and then cast him in the blazing fire!”
So they tried to execute their evil scheme upon him – We therefore degraded them. (Allah saved him, by commanding the fire to turn cool).
And he said, “Indeed I shall go to my Lord Who will guide me.”
“My Lord! Give me a meritorious child.”
We therefore gave him the glad tidings of an intelligent son.
And when he became capable of working with him, Ibrahim said, “O my son, I dreamt that I am sacrificing you – therefore now consider what is your opinion”; he said, “O my father!
Do what you are commanded!
Allah willing, you will soon find me patiently enduring!”
Then (remember) when they both submitted to Allah’s command, and Ibrahim lay his son facing downwards. (The knife did not hurt Ismail)
And We called out to him, “O Ibrahim!”
“You have indeed made the dream come true”; and this is how We reward the virtuous.
Indeed this was a clear test.
And We rescued him in exchange of a great sacrifice. (The sacrifice of Ibrahim and Ismail – peace be upon them – is commemorated every year on 10, 11 and 12 Zil Haj).
And We kept his praise among the latter generations.
Peace be upon Ibrahim!
This is how We reward the virtuous.
He is indeed one of Our high ranking, firmly believing bondmen.
And We gave him the glad tidings of Ishaq, a Herald of the Hidden, from among those who deserve Our proximity.
And We sent blessings upon him and Ishaq; and among their descendants – some who do good deeds, and some who clearly wrong themselves.
And We indeed did a great favour to Moosa and Haroon.
And rescued them and their people from the great calamity.
And We helped them, so they were victorious.
And We bestowed the clear Book to both of them.
And guided them to the Straight Path.
And We kept their praise among the latter generations.
Peace be upon Moosa and Haroon!
This is how We reward the virtuous.
Indeed they are two of Our high ranking, firmly believing bondmen.
And indeed Ilyas is one of the Noble Messengers.
When he said to his people, “Do you not fear?”
“What! You worship Baal (an idol) and leave the Best Creator?” –
“Allah – Who is your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers?”
In response they denied him, so they will surely be brought forth as captives.
Except the chosen bondmen of Allah.
And We kept his praise among the latter generations.
Peace be upon Ilyas!
This is how We reward the virtuous.
He is indeed one of Our high ranking, firmly believing bondmen.
And indeed Lut is one of the Noble Messengers.
When We rescued him and his entire household.
Except an old woman, who became of those who stayed behind.
We then destroyed the others.
And indeed you pass over them in the morning. –
And during the night; so do you not have sense?
And indeed Yunus is one of the Noble Messengers.
When he left towards the laden ship.
Then lots were drawn and he became of those who were pushed into the sea.
The fish then swallowed him and he blamed himself. (For not waiting for Allah’s command.)
And were he not one of those who praise. –
He would have remained in its belly till the day when all will be raised.
We then put him ashore on a plain, and he was sick.
And We grew a tree of gourd (as a shelter) above him.
And We sent him towards a hundred thousand people, in fact more.
So they accepted faith – We therefore gave them usage for a while.
Therefore ask them (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), whether the daughters are for your Lord and the sons for them!
Or that have We created the angels as females, while they were present?
Pay heed! It is their slander that they say. –
That “Allah has offspring”; and indeed, surely, they are liars.
“Has he chosen daughters instead of sons?”
“What is the matter with you?
What sort of a judgement you impose!”
“So do you not ponder?”
“Or do you have some clear proof?”
“Then bring forth your Book, if you are truthful!”
And they have appointed a relationship between Him and the jinns; and indeed the jinns surely know that they will be brought forth.
Purity is to Allah from the matters they fabricate.
Except the chosen bondmen of Allah.
Therefore you and all what you worship. (The disbelievers and their deities.)
You cannot make anyone rebel against Him.
Except the one who will go into the blazing fire.
And the angels say, “Each one of us has an appointed known position.”
“And indeed we, with our wings spread, await the command.”
“And indeed we are those who say His purity.”
And indeed the disbelievers used to say, –
“If we had some advice from the earlier generations,” –
“We would certainly be the chosen bondmen of Allah.”
They therefore denied it, so they will soon come to know.
And indeed Our Word has already gone forth for Our bondmen who were sent.
That undoubtedly, only they will be helped.
And surely, only Our army will be victorious.
Therefore turn away from them for some time.
And watch them, for they will soon see.
So are they being impatient for Our punishment?
So when it does descend in their courtyards – so what an evil morning it will be for those who were warned!
And turn away from them for some time.
And wait, for they will soon see.
Purity is to your Lord, the Lord of Honour, from all what they say.
And peace is upon the Noble Messengers.
And all praise is to Allah, the Lord Of The Creation.
Saad* – By oath of the renowned Qur’an, (Alphabet of the Arabic language; Allah and to whomever He reveals, know their precise meanings.)
In fact, the disbelievers are in false pride and opposition.
Many a generation We did destroy before them – thereupon they cried out whereas it is not the time to escape!
And they were surprised that a Herald of Warning came to them from among themselves; and the disbelievers said, “He is a magician, a great liar!”
“Has he made all the Gods into One God?
This is really something very strange!”
And their leaders went about, “Leave him and cling steadfastly to your Gods!
Indeed he has a hidden objective in this!”
“We never heard of this even in Christianity, the latest religion; this is clearly a newly fabricated matter.”
“Is the Qur’an which is sent to him, among us?”
In fact they are in a doubt concerning My Book; in fact, they have not yet tasted My punishment.
Or do they hold the treasures of the mercy of your Lord, the Almighty, the Great Bestower?
Is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, for them?
So would they not just ascend using ropes?
This is just one of the disgraced armies, that will be routed there and then.
Before them, the people of Nooh had denied, and the tribe of A’ad, and Firaun who used to crucify.
And the tribe of Thamud, and the people of Lut, and the People of the Woods; these are the groups.
None of them was such that it did not deny the Noble Messengers, therefore My punishment became inevitable.
They await just one Scream, which no one can avert.
And they said, “Our Lord! Give us our share quickly, before the Day of Reckoning.”
Have patience upon what they say, and remember Our bondman Dawud, the one blessed with favours; he is indeed most inclined (towards His Lord).
Indeed We subjected the hills to say the praise with him, at night and at morn.
And birds gathered together; they were all obedient to him.
And We strengthened his kingdom and gave him wisdom and just speech.
And did the news of the two disputants reach you?
When they scaled over the wall into Dawud’s mosque.
When they entered upon David, so he feared them – they said, “Do not fear!
We are two disputants, one of whom has wronged the other, therefore judge fairly between us and do not judge unjustly – and show us the right way.”
“This is my brother; he has ninety nine ewes and I have one ewe; and he now says ‘Give that one also to me’ – and he is very demanding in speech.”
Said Dawud, “He is indeed being unjust to you in that he demands to add your ewe to his ewes; and indeed most partners wrong one another, except those who believe and do good deeds – and they are very few!”
Thereupon Dawud realised that We had tested him, so he sought forgiveness from his Lord, and fell prostrate and inclined (towards his Lord). (Command of Prostration # 10)
We therefore forgave him this; and indeed for him in Our presence are, surely, proximity and an excellent abode.
“O Dawud! We have indeed appointed you as a Viceroy in the earth, therefore judge between mankind with the truth, and do not follow desire for it will lead you astray from Allah’s path; indeed for those who stray away from Allah’s path is a severe punishment, because they forgot the Day of Reckoning.”
And We have not created the heaven and the earth and all that is between them without purpose; this is what the disbelievers assume; therefore ruin is for the disbelievers, by the fire.
Shall We make those who believe and do good deeds equal to those who spread turmoil in the earth?
Or shall We equate the pious with the disobedient?
This is a Book which We have sent down upon you, a blessed Book, for them to ponder upon its verses, and for men of intellect to accept advice.
And We bestowed Sulaiman to Dawud; what an excellent bondman! He is indeed most inclined.
When fast footed steeds were presented to him at evening.
Therefore Sulaiman said, “I cherish the love of these horses*, out of remembrance of my Lord”; he then ordered them to be raced until they vanished in a curtain out of sight. (To be used in holy war.)
He then ordered, “Bring them back to me”; and he began caressing their shins and necks.
And We indeed tested Sulaiman, and placed a dead body on his throne – he therefore inclined towards His Lord.
He said, “My Lord! Forgive me and bestow upon me a kingdom, which shall not befit anyone after me; indeed only You are the Great Bestower.”
We therefore gave the wind under his control, moving steadily by his command wherever he wished.
And made the demons subservient to him, all builders and divers.
And other demons bound in chains.
“This is Our bestowal – you may therefore bestow favours or withhold them – you will not be questioned.”
And indeed for him in Our presence are, surely, proximity and an excellent abode.
And remember Our bondman Ayyub (Job); when he cried out* to his Lord, “The devil has struck me with hardship and pain.” (After seven years of patience.)
We said to him, “Strike the earth with your foot; this cool spring is for bathing and drinking.”
(A spring of gushed forth when he struck the earth – this was a miracle.)
And We bestowed his household to him and one more similar to it – as a mercy from Us, and as a remembrance for the people of intellect.
And We said, “Take a broom in your hand and strike her with it, and do not break your vow”; We indeed found him patiently enduring; what an excellent bondman!
He is indeed most inclined.
And remember Our bondmen Ibrahim, and Ishaq, and Yaqub – the men of power and knowledge.
We indeed gave them distinction with a genuine affair – the remembrance of the (everlasting) abode.
And in Our sight, they are indeed the chosen ones, the beloved.
And remember Ismail and Yasa’a (Elisha) and Zul-Kifl; and they are all excellent.
This is an advice; and indeed for the pious is an excellent abode.
Everlasting Gardens – all its gates are open for them.
Reclining on pillows, in it they ask for fruits and drinks in plenty.
And with them are the pure spouses, who do not set gaze upon men except their husbands, of single age.
This is the promise being given to you, for the Day of Reckoning.
Indeed this is Our sustenance, which will never end.
This is for the virtuous; and indeed for the rebellious is a wretched destination.
Hell; which they shall enter; what an evil resting-place!
This is for the criminals – so that they may taste it – boiling hot water and pus.
And similar other punishments in pairs.
“Here is another group that was with you, falling along with you”; they will answer, “Do not give them plenty of open space; they surely have to enter the fire – let them also be confined!”
The followers will say, “In fact, for you!
May you not get open space!
It is you who brought this calamity upon us!”
So what a wretched destination.
They say, “Our Lord! Whoever has brought this calamity upon us – double the punishment of the fire for him!”
And they say, “What is the matter with us that we do not see the men whom we thought were evil?”
“Did we mock at them or did our eyes turn away from them?”
Indeed this is really true – the people of the hell quarrelling among themselves.
Proclaim (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “I am purely a Herald of Warning – and there is no God except Allah, the One, the All Dominant.”
“Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them – the Almighty, the Oft Forgiving.”
Say, “That is a great tidings.”
“You are neglectful of it!”
“What did I know of the heavenly world, when the angels had disputed.”
“I receive only the divine revelations, that I am purely a clear Herald of Warning.”
(Remember) When your Lord said to the angels, “I will create a human from clay.” –
“So when I have perfected him and breathed into him a spirit from Myself, (you all) fall down before him in prostration.”
So all the angels prostrated, every one, without exception.
Except Iblis; he was proud and was, from the beginning, a disbeliever.
Said Allah, “O Iblis! What prevented you from prostrating before one whom I have created with My hands*?
Have you become proud or were you haughty from the beginning?” (Used as a metaphor).
Said Iblis, “I am better than him; You made me from fire, and You have created him from clay!”
He said, “Therefore exit from heaven, for you have been outcast.” (To disrespect the Prophets – peace and blessings be upon them – is blasphemy.)
“And indeed My curse is upon you till the Day of Judgement.”
He said, “My Lord! Therefore give me respite till the day when all will be raised.”
Said Allah, “You are therefore among those given respite.”
“Until the time of the known day.”
He said, “Therefore, by oath of Your honour, I will surely mislead all of them.”
“Except Your chosen bondmen among them.”
Said Allah, “So this is the truth; and I speak only the truth.” –
“That I will fill hell with you and with those among them who follow you, all together.”
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) “I do not ask any fee from you for the Qur’an, and I am not a fabricator.”
“It is not but an advice for the entire world.”
“And you will come to know of its tidings, after a while.”
The revelation of the Book is from Allah, the Most Honourable, the Wise.
We have indeed divinely revealed the Book to you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) with the truth, therefore worship Allah, as His sincere bondman.
Pay heed!
Worship is for Allah only; and those who have taken others as their supporters beside Him say; “We worship* them only so that they get us closer to Allah”; Allah will surely judge between them regarding the matter in which they dispute; indeed Allah does not guide one who is a big liar, extremely ungrateful. (*The pagans regarded their idols as smaller Gods and worshipped them. So did the Christians.
This does not apply to Muslims who only respect their elders, and ask for their blessings.)
Were Allah to create a son* for Himself, He would have chosen any one from His creation!
Purity is to Him!
He is Allah, the One, the All Dominant. (*Which is impossible.)
It is He Who created the heavens and the earth with the truth; He envelops the night over day and envelops the day over night, and He has subjected the sun and the moon; each one runs for its appointed term; pay heed!
He only is the Most Honourable, the Oft Forgiving.
It is He Who created you from a single being, and then from the same being created its spouse, and sent down for you eight pairs of animals; He creates you in your mothers’ wombs, from one sort to another, in a triple darkness; such is Allah, your Lord – for Him only is the kingship; there is no God except Him; so where are you being turned away?
If you become ungrateful, then (know that) indeed Allah is Independent of you; and He does not like the ungratefulness of His bondmen; and if you give thanks, He is pleased with it for you; and no burdened soul will bear another soul’s burden; you have then to return towards your Lord – He will therefore inform you of what you used to do; undoubtedly, He knows what lies within the hearts.
And when some hardship strikes man, he prays to his Lord, inclined only towards Him – then when Allah grants him a favour from Himself, he forgets why he had prayed to Him earlier, and sets up equals to Allah in order to mislead from Allah’s way; proclaim, “Revel in your disbelief for some days; you are indeed of the people of the fire.”
Will he, whose night hours pass in obedience while prostrating and standing, fearing the Hereafter and hoping for the mercy of his Lord, ever be equal to the disobedient?
Proclaim, “Are the knowledgeable and the ignorant equal?”
It is only the men of intellect who heed advice.
Proclaim (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “O my slaves who have accepted faith!
Fear your Lord; for those who do good deeds in this world is goodness (in return); and Allah’s earth is spacious; it is the steadfast who will be paid their full reward, without account.”
Say, “I am commanded that I must worship Allah as His sincere bondman.” (And so must you too.)
“And I am commanded that I be the first to submit.”
Say, “Were I to disobey my Lord, I too would fear the punishment of the great Day (of Resurrection).”
Proclaim, “I worship only Allah, as His sincere bondman.”
“Therefore you can worship what you want besides Him!”
Say, “The worst losers are those who will lose themselves and their household on the Day of Resurrection; pay heed!
This is the plain loss!”
Above them are mountains of fire and beneath them are mountains of fire; Allah scares His bondmen with this; “O My bondmen! Fear Me!”
And those who stayed away from the worship of idols, and inclined towards Allah – for them are glad tidings; therefore give glad tidings to My bondmen. –
Those who heed attentively and follow the best from it; it is these whom Allah has guided, and it is these who have intelligence.
So will the one upon whom the Word of punishment has proved true, ever be equal to those who are forgiven? So will you guide and save the one who deserves the fire?
(Because the hearts of some disbelievers are sealed).
But for those who fear their Lord, are the high chambers with more high chambers built above them – rivers flowing beneath them; a promise of Allah; Allah does not renege on His promise.
Did you not see that it is Allah Who sent down water from the sky, and then with it made springs in the earth, and then with it produces crops of various colours, and then it dries up and you see it has become yellow, and He then fragments them into small pieces; indeed in this is a reminder for people of intellect.
So will he whose bosom Allah has opened up for Islam – he is therefore upon a light from his Lord – ever be equal to one who is stone hearted?
Therefore ruin is for those whose hearts are hardened towards the remembrance of Allah; they are in open error.
Allah has sent down the best of Books (the Holy Qur’an), which is consistent throughout, the one with paired statements; the hairs on the skins of those who fear their Lord, stand on end with it; then their skins and their hearts soften, inclined towards the remembrance of Allah; this is the guidance of Allah, He may guide whomever He wills with it; and whomever Allah sends astray, there is no guide for him.
So will he who will not have a shield except his own face against the wretched punishment on the Day of Resurrection, ever be equal to one who is forgiven?
And it will be said to the unjust, “Taste what you have earned!”
Those before them had denied, therefore the punishment came to them from a place they did not know.
So Allah made them taste humiliation in the life of this world; and indeed the punishment of the Hereafter is the greatest; if only they knew!
And We have indeed illustrated examples of all kinds in this Qur’an, so that they may ponder.
The Qur’an in Arabic, having no deviation at all, so that they may be pious.
Allah illustrates an example – “A man having several wicked masters as partners, and another man belonging wholly to just one master; are the two equal in comparison?”
All praise is to Allah; in fact, most among them do not know.
Indeed you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) will taste death, and they (the disbelievers) too will die.
Then you will dispute before your Lord on the Day of Resurrection.
So who is more unjust than one who fabricates a lie against Allah, and denies the truth when it comes to him?
Is not the destination of disbelievers in hell?
And those who brought this truth and those who testify for it – these are the pious.
For them is whatever they wish, before their Lord; this is the reward of the virtuous.
So that Allah may relieve them of their worst deeds, and reward them for the best deeds they had done.
Is not Allah Sufficient for His slave?
And they threaten you with others beside Him!
And whomever Allah sends astray – there is no guide for him.
And no one can mislead whomever Allah guides; is not Allah the Most Honourable, the Avenger?
And if you ask them, “Who has created the heavens and the earth?”, they will surely say, “Allah”; say, “What is your opinion regarding those whom you worship other than Allah – if Allah wills to cause me some hardship, so will they avert the hardship sent by Him?
Or if He wills to have mercy upon me, so will they restrain His mercy?”
Proclaim, “Allah is Sufficient for me; the people who trust must rely only upon Him.”
Proclaim, “O my people! Keep on with your works in your positions, I am doing mine; so you will soon come to know.” –
“To whom will come a punishment that will disgrace, and upon whom descends the punishment that never ends.”
We have indeed sent down this Book to you with the truth, in order to guide mankind; so whoever attains guidance has attained it is for his own good, and whoever strays, has strayed for his own harm; and you are not at all responsible for them.
It is Allah Who gives death* to living beings at the time of their demise, and to those who do not die, during their sleep; so He restrains the soul on which the decree of death has been passed, and leaves the other till the appointed term; indeed in this are signs for people who reflect. (*Death is of 2 types – passing to the next world, and sleeping.)
What! Have they chosen intercessors against Allah?
Proclaim, “What! Even if they do not own anything nor have any intelligence?”
Proclaim, “To Allah only* belongs all the intercession!
For Him only is the kingship of the heavens and the earth; and then it is towards you have to return.” (*Allah does not intercede – He gives the permission to intercede with Him, to whomever He wills.)
And when Allah the One God is mentioned, the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter get constricted; and when others (false deities) besides Him are mentioned, they rejoice!
Invoke (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “O Allah!
The Creator of the heavens and the earth, the All Knowing of all the hidden and the open, You will judge between Your bondmen, regarding the matters in which they differed.”
And if the unjust owned all that is in the earth, and another one in addition to it, they would surely give it in exchange for freedom from the wretched punishment on the Day of Resurrection; and a matter which they had never imagined, appeared to them from their Lord.
And the evils they earned appeared to them, and the thing they used to mock at descended upon them.
So when some hardship reaches man, he prays to Us; then later when We bestow a favour upon him, he says, “I obtained this only because of some knowledge”; in fact it is a test, but most of them do not have any knowledge.
Those before them also said the same, so their earnings did not benefit them at all.
Therefore the evils of their earnings befell them; and those who are unjust among them – soon the evils of the earnings will befall them, and they cannot escape.
Do they not know that Allah eases the sustenance for whomever He wills, and restricts it?
Indeed in this are signs for the People who Believe.
Proclaim (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “O my* slaves, who have wronged themselves, do not lose hope in Allah’s mercy; indeed Allah forgives all sins; indeed He only is the Oft Forgiving, the Most Merciful.” (All Muslims are truly the slaves of Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him.)
“And incline towards your Lord and submit to Him, before the punishment comes you and then you may not be helped.”
“And follow this, the best among all, which has been sent down towards you from your Lord, before the punishment comes suddenly upon you whilst you are unaware.”
So that no soul may say, “Alas! The failures that I committed regarding Allah – and indeed I used to mock!”
Or (so that no soul) may say, “If Allah had shown me the right path, I would then be among the pious!”
Or (so that no soul) may say when it beholds the punishment, “If only I may be sent back, so that I may do good deeds!”
It will be said to him, “Surely yes, why not?* My signs did come to you, so you denied them and you were haughty and you were a disbeliever.” (They will be mocked at.)
And you will see on the Day of Resurrection the fabricators of lies against Allah, with their faces blackened; is not the destination of the haughty in hell?
And Allah will rescue the pious, to their place of salvation; neither will the punishment touch them, nor shall they grieve.
Allah is Creator of all things; and He only is the Controller of all things.
For Him only are the keys of the heavens and the earth; and those who denied the signs of Allah – it is they who are the losers.
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) “So do you instruct me to worship (deities) other than Allah? You ignorant fools!”
And it was indeed revealed to you and to those before you; that, “O listener! If you ascribe a partner to Allah, all your deeds will go to waste and you will surely be a loser.”
But rather worship only Allah, and be among the thankful!
And they did not realise the importance of Allah as was His right; and on the Day of Resurrection, He will compress the lands and the heavens will be rolled up by His power; Purity and Supremacy are to Him, from all what they ascribe as partners.
And the Trumpet will be blown, so everyone in the heavens and everyone in the earth will fall unconscious, except whomever* Allah wills; it will then be blown again, thereupon they will get up staring! (*Prophet Moosa and / or some angels).
And the earth will shine bright by the light of its Lord, and the Book will be established, and the Prophets and this Noble Prophet and the witnesses upon them from this nation will be brought, and it will be judged between them with the truth, and they will not be wronged.
And every soul will be repaid for its deeds in full, and He knows very well what they used to do.
And the disbelievers will be herded towards hell in groups; to the extent that when they reach it, its gates will be opened, and its guards will say to them, “Did not the Noble Messengers come to you from amongst you, who used to recite to you the verses of your Lord and warn you of confronting this Day?”
They will say, “Yes indeed, why not?”
But the Word of punishment proved true upon the disbelievers.
It will be said, “Enter the gates of hell to remain in it forever”; so what a wretched destination for the haughty!
And the mounts of those who feared their Lord will be led towards Paradise, in groups; to the extent that when they reach it, its gates will be opened and its guards will say to them, “Peace be upon you!
You have done well! Therefore enter Paradise, to abide in it forever.”
And they will say, “All praise is to Allah, Who has made His promise to us come true, and has bequeathed us this land, to stay in Paradise wherever we wish!”
So what an excellent reward for the performers!
And you will see the angels gathered around the Throne, saying the Purity of their Lord, with praise; and a true judgement will be delivered between the people, and it will be said, “All praise is to Allah, the Lord Of The Creation!”
Ha-Meem. (Alphabets of the Arabic Language – Allah, and to whomever he reveals, know their precise meanings.)
The revelation of the Book is from Allah, the Most Honourable, the All Knowing.
The Forgiver of sin, and the Most Acceptor of Repentance, the Severe in Punishing, the Greatly Rewarding; there is no God except Him; towards Him only is the return.
None except the disbelievers dispute the signs of Allah, therefore do not let their free movements in the land deceive you.
Before them, the people of Nooh and the groups after them had denied; and every nation intended to apprehend its Noble Messenger, and they fought along with falsehood to avert the truth, so I seized them; so how did My punishment turn out?
And this is how the Word of your Lord has proved true upon the disbelievers that they are people of the hell.
Those* who bear the Throne, and those who are around it, say the Purity of their Lord while praising Him, and they believe in Him and seek forgiveness for the believers; “O Our Lord!
Your mercy and knowledge encompass all things, therefore forgive those who repented and followed Your path, and save them from the punishment of hell.” (* The angels.)
“O Our Lord! And admit them into the Gardens of everlasting stay which you have promised them, and those who are virtuous among their forefathers and their wives and their offspring; indeed You only are the Most Honourable, the Wise.”
“And save them from the evil consequences of sins; and whomever You save from the evil consequences of sins on that Day – so You have indeed had mercy upon him; and this only is the greatest success.”
The disbelievers will indeed be called out to – “Indeed Allah’s disgust with you is greater than your own abhorrence of yourselves, whereas you used to deny when you were called towards the faith!”
They will say, “O Our Lord! Twice You have given us death and twice You have given us life* – we now confess to our sins – so is there a way out of the fire?”
(From nothingness to life in this world, to death and then Resurrection.)
“This has occurred because when Allah the One was prayed to, you used to disbelieve; and when a partner was ascribed with Him, you used to believe; so the command is only for Allah, the Supreme, the Great.”
It is He Who shows you His signs, and sends down sustenance from the sky for you; and none accept guidance except those who incline (towards Him).
Therefore worship Allah, as His sincere bondmen even if the disbelievers get annoyed.
Bestower of High Ranks, Owner of the Throne; it is He Who instils the spirit of faith into the one He wills among His bondmen, in order that he may warn of the Day of Meeting. –
A day when they will be fully exposed; nothing from their affairs will be hidden from Allah; “For whom is the kingship this day?
For Allah, the One, the All Dominant.”
This day each soul will be repaid for what it has earned; no one will be wronged this day; indeed Allah is Swift At Taking Account.
And warn them of the day of impending calamity, when hearts will rise up to the throats filled with grief; and the disbelievers will have neither any friend nor any intercessor who will be obeyed. (Intercession will be accepted only for the Muslims, not for the disbelievers)
Allah well knows the covert glance and all what lies hidden in the hearts.
And Allah renders the true judgement; and those whom they worship instead of Him do not judge at all; indeed Allah only, is the All Hearing, the All Seeing.
So did they not travel in the land in order to see what sort of fate befell those before them?
Their strength and the signs they left behind in the earth, exceeded them – so Allah seized them on account of their sins, and they had no one to save them from Allah.
This occurred because their Noble Messengers came to them with clear signs, thereupon they used to disbelieve, so Allah seized them; indeed Allah is All Powerful, Severe in Punishment.
And indeed We sent Moosa with Our signs and a clear proof.
Towards Firaun and Haman and Qaroon – in response they said, “(He is) a magician, a big liar!”
So when he brought the truth from Our presence to them, they said, “Kill the sons of those who believe in him, and keep their women alive”; and the evil scheme of the disbelievers only keeps wandering astray.
And said Firaun, “Allow me to kill Moosa and let him pray to his Lord; I fear that he will change your religion or cause chaos in the land!”
Said Moosa, “I seek the refuge of mine and your Lord, from every haughty person who does not believe in the Day of Reckoning.”
And said a Muslim man from the people of Firaun, who used to hide his faith, “What! You want to kill a man just because he says, ‘Allah is my Lord’ whereas he has indeed brought clear signs to you from your Lord?
And supposedly if he is speaking wrongly, then the calamity of wrongful speech is upon him; and if he is truthful, then part of what he promises you will reach you; indeed Allah does not guide any transgressor, excessive liar.”
“O my people! You now rule the earth, dominant; so who will save us from Allah’s punishment if it comes upon us?”
Said Firaun, “I only explain to you what I think is correct, and I show you only the right path.”
And the believer said, “O my people! I fear for you a day similar to that of the earlier groups!”
“Like the tradition of the people of Nooh, and Aad, and Thamud and others after them; and Allah does not will injustice upon bondmen.”
“O my people! I fear for you a day on which will be a great outcry!”
“A day when you will turn back fleeing; none can save you from Allah; and whomever Allah sends astray, there is no guide for him.”
“And indeed Yusuf came to you with clear signs before this, thereupon you remained doubtful concerning what he had brought; to the extent that when he died, you said, ‘Allah will surely not send any Noble Messenger after him’”; this is how Allah sends astray whoever transgresses, is doubtful. –
Those who dispute regarding the signs of Allah without any proof having come to them; how very disgusting this is, in the sight of Allah and in the sight of the believers!
This is how Allah seals the entire heart of every haughty, rebellious person.
And said Firaun, “O Haman! Build a high palace for me, in order that I may reach the routes.” –
“The routes of the heavens, in order to glance at the God of Moosa – and indeed I think he is a liar”; this is how the evil deeds of Firaun were made seeming good to him, and he was stopped from the path; and the evil scheme of Firaun was destined to be ruined.
And the believer said, “O my people!
Follow me, I shall show you the way of righteousness.”
“O my people! The life of this world is just a brief usage, and indeed the next abode is one of everlasting stay.”
“Whoever commits an evil deed will not be repaid except to the same extent; and whoever does good deeds, whether a man or a woman, and is a Muslim, will be admitted into Paradise, in which they will receive sustenance without account.”
“And O my people! What is the matter with me that I call you towards salvation whereas you call me towards hell?”
“You call me to disbelieve in Allah and ascribe such as partners to Him, regarding whom I do not have any knowledge – whereas I call you towards the Most Honourable, the Oft Forgiving!”
“So it is self evident that what you call me towards has no benefit being prayed to, either in this world or in the Hereafter, and that our return is towards Allah, and that the transgressors only are the people of the fire.”
“And soon the time will come when you will remember what I now say to you; and I entrust my tasks to Allah; indeed Allah sees the bondmen.”
Therefore Allah saved him from the evils of their scheming, and an evil punishment enveloped the people of Firaun. –
The fire – upon which they are presented morning and evening; and when the Last Day is established – “Put the people of Firaun into the most severe punishment.” (Punishment in the grave is proven by this verse.)
And when they will quarrel amongst themselves in the fire, those who were weak will say to those who sought greatness, “We were your followers, so will you reduce from us some of the punishment of the fire?”
Those who were proud will say, “We are all in the fire – indeed Allah has already passed the judgement among the bondmen.”
And those who are in the fire said to its guards, “Pray to your Lord to decrease the punishment upon us for one day.”
They said, “Is it not that your Noble Messengers used to come to you with clear signs?”
They said, “Why not, surely yes!”
They said, “Then you yourselves pray”; and the prayer of the disbelievers is nothing but astray.
Indeed We will surely help Our Noble Messengers, and the believers, in the life of this world and on the day when the witnesses will be standing.
The day on which the unjust will not gain any benefit from their excuses, and for them is the curse, and for them is the wretched home.
And indeed We gave Moosa the guidance, and bequeathed the Book to the Descendants of Israel.
A guidance and an advice for the people of intellect.
Therefore be patient (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), undoubtedly Allah’s promise is true, and seek forgiveness for the sins of your own people, and praising your Lord, proclaim His Purity morning and evening.
Those who dispute concerning the signs of Allah without any proof having come to them – in their hearts is nothing but a craving for greatness which they shall never achieve; therefore seek the refuge of Allah; indeed He only is the All Hearing, the All Seeing.
Certainly the creation of the heavens and the earth is far greater than the creation of men, but most people do not know.
And the blind and the sighted are not equal – and neither are the believers who perform good deeds and the wicked equal; how very little do you ponder!
Indeed the Last Day will surely come, there is no doubt in it – but most people do not accept faith.
And your Lord proclaimed, “Pray to Me, I will accept; indeed those who stay conceited towards worshipping Me, will enter hell in disgrace."
It is Allah Who created night for you so that you may gain rest in it, and the day giving sight; indeed Allah is Most Munificent towards mankind, but most people do not give thanks.
Such is Allah, your Lord, the Creator of all things; there is no God except Him; so where are you reverting?
This is how those who deny the signs of Allah go reverting.
It is Allah Who made for you the earth your resting place and the sky a canopy, and moulded you so gave you the best shape, and gave you pure things for sustenance; such is Allah, your Lord; so Most Auspicious is Allah, the Lord Of The Creation.
It is He, the Alive – there is no God except Him; therefore worship Him as His sincere bondmen; all praise is to Allah, the Lord Of The Creation.
Proclaim (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “I have been forbidden to worship those whom you worship besides Allah whilst clear proofs have come to me from my Lord; and I have been commanded to submit to the Lord Of The Creation.”
It is He Who created you from clay, then from a drop of liquid, then from a clot of blood, and then brings you forth as a child, then keeps you alive for you to reach adulthood and then to become old; and some among you pass away earlier, and for you to reach an appointed term, and so that you may understand.
It is He Who gives life and death; so whenever He wills a thing, He only says to it “Be” – it thereupon happens!
Did you not see those who dispute concerning the signs of Allah?
Where are they being diverted?
Those who denied the Book and what We sent with Our Noble Messengers; so they will soon come to know. –
When around their necks will be shackles and chains; they will be dragged. –
In boiling water; they will then be ignited* in the fire. (Like fuel – see verse 2:24)
It will then be said to them, “Where are the partners you used to appoint?” –
“As rivals to Allah?”; they will say, “We have lost them – in fact we never used to worship anything before!”; this is how Allah sends the disbelievers astray.
“This is the recompense of your being happy upon falsehood in the earth, and the recompense of your conceit.”
“Enter the gates of hell, to remain in it forever”; so what a wretched destination for the haughty!
Therefore be patient (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), undoubtedly Allah’s promise is true; and whether We show some of what We promise them, or cause you to pass away before it – in any case they will return to Us.
Indeed We sent many Noble Messengers before you, so We have related to you the affairs of some among them, and not related the affairs of some; and no Noble Messenger has the right to bring any sign except with the command of Allah; so the time when the command of Allah comes, the true judgement will be delivered and there will the people of falsehood be ruined.
It is Allah Who created the animals for you, in order for you to ride some of them, and some to eat.
And in them are numerous benefits for you, and for you to reach your hearts’ desires while riding them – and you ride upon them and upon the ships.
And He shows you His signs; so which sign of Allah will you deny?
Did they not travel in the land to see what sort of fate befell those before them?
They were more than these in number, and they exceeded them in strength and the signs they left behind in the earth – so what benefit did they get from what they earned?
So when their Noble Messengers came to them with clear signs, they remained happy over the worldly knowledge they possessed, and upon them only reverted what they used to mock at!
So when they saw Our punishment, they said, “We accept faith in the One Allah, and reject those whom we ascribed with Him.”
So their accepting of faith did not benefit them when they saw Our punishment; the tradition of Allah which has passed among His bondmen; and there were the disbelievers ruined.
Ha-Meem. (Alphabets of the Arabic language – Allah, and to whomever He reveals, know their precise meanings.)
This (Qur’an) is sent down from the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
A Book the verses of which are explained in detail, the Qur’an in Arabic for people of intellect.
Giving glad tidings and heralding warning; so most of them turned away, therefore they cannot listen (to the truth).
And they say, “Our hearts are covered against the affair you call us to, and there is deafness in our ears, and there is a barrier between us and you – therefore mind your own business, we are minding ours.”
Proclaim (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “Physically I am a human like you – I receive the divine revelation that your God is only One God, therefore be upright towards Him and seek forgiveness from Him”; and woe is to the polytheists. –
Those who do not give the obligatory charity, and who deny the Hereafter.
Indeed for those who believed and did good deeds, is a limitless reward.
Say “What! You disbelieve in Him Who created the earth in two days, and you appoint equals to Him?
He is the Lord Of The Creation!”
And in it He placed mountains as anchors from above it, and blessings in it, and appointed the sustenance for those who dwell in it – all this in four days; a proper answer to those who question.
He then inclined towards the heavens and it was smoke – thereupon He said to it and to the earth, “Both of you present yourselves, willingly or with reluctance”; they said, “We present ourselves, with zeal.”
He then established them into seven heavens in two days, and to each heaven He sent the command of its affairs; and We decorated the lower heaven with lamps; and for its protection; this is the command set by the Most Honourable, the All Knowing.
Then if they turn away say, “I warn you of a thunderbolt like the thunderbolt which came upon A’ad and Thamud.”
When their Noble Messengers approached them from front and from behind saying, "Do not worship any one except Allah"; they said, "If our Lord willed, He would surely have sent down angels – we therefore deny whatever you have been sent with.”
So regarding the A’ad, they were haughty in the land without right, and they said, “Who is more powerful than us?”
Did they not realise that Allah, Who created them, is more powerful than them?
And they used to deny Our signs.
We therefore sent a violent thunderstorm towards them in their days of misfortune, in order to make them taste a disgraceful punishment in the life of this world; and indeed the punishment of the Hereafter is more disgracing, and they will not be helped.
And regarding the Thamud, We showed them the right path – so they chose to be blind above being guided, therefore the thunderbolt of the disgraceful punishment overcame them – the recompense of their deeds.
And We rescued those who accepted faith and were pious.
And on the day when the enemies of Allah are herded towards the fire, the earlier groups will be restrained till the latter join them.
To the extent that when they reach it, their ears and their eyes and their skins will testify against them for what they used to do.
And they will say to their skins, “Why did you testify against us?"; they will say, “Allah has made us talk, Who has given all things the power of speech, and it is He Who created you the first time, and it is to Him that you have to return.”
And where could you hide from Him, so that your ears and your eyes and your skins may not testify against you? But you had assumed that Allah does not know most of your deeds!
And this is the assumption you had regarding your Lord, which has ruined you, so you are now among those who have been defeated.
Then if they are patient, even then the fire is their home; and if they plead, none will listen to their pleading.
And We appointed companions for them, who made what is before them and what is after them seem good to them, and the Word proved true upon them along with the groups of jinns and men who passed away before them; they were indeed losers.
And the disbelievers said, “Do not listen to this Qur’an and engulf it in noise – perhaps you may be victorious this way.”
So We will indeed make the disbelievers taste the severe punishment, and indeed We will repay them for their worst deeds.
This is the recompense of Allah’s enemies – the fire; they have to stay in it forever; the penalty for denying Our signs.
And the disbelievers said, “Our Lord! Show us both – among jinns and men – who misled us, for us to put them beneath our feet so that they be the lowest of the low.”
Indeed those who said, “Allah is our Lord” and remained firm upon it – upon them descend the angels, (saying), “Do not fear nor grieve, and be happy for the Paradise which you are promised.”
“We are your friends in the life of this world and in the Hereafter; in it for you is all that you may wish for, and for you is all what you ask.”
“The hospitality of the Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.”
And whose speech is better than one who calls towards his Lord and does righteous deeds, and says, “I am a Muslim.”?
And the good deed and the evil deed will never be equal; O listener!
Repel the evil deed with a good one, thereupon the one between whom and you was enmity, will become like a close friend.
And none receive this great treasure except those who are patient; and none receives this except one who is extremely fortunate.
And O listener! If a distracting thought from the devil reaches you, seek the refuge of Allah; indeed He is the All Hearing, the All Knowing.
And the night, and the day, and the sun, and the moon are among His signs; do not prostrate for the sun or the moon, but prostrate for Allah Who has created them, if you are His bondmen.
So if these (disbelievers) be haughty, so (in any case) those (the angels) who are with your Lord say His Purity night and day, and they do not get weary. (Command of prostration # 11)
And among His signs is that you see the earth lying neglected, so when We sent down water on it, it freshened up and grew forth; indeed He Who gave it life, will revive the dead; indeed He is Able to do all things.
Indeed those who distort Our verses are not hidden from Us; so is one who is cast into the fire better, or one who comes in safety on the Day of Resurrection? Do whatever you wish!
He is indeed seeing your deeds.
Indeed those who denied the Remembrance when it came to them – they are truly ruined; and indeed it is an honourable Book.
Falsehood cannot approach it – neither from its front nor from its back; it is sent down by the Wise, the Most Praiseworthy.
You will not be told except what was said to the Noble Messengers before you; that “Your Lord is the Owner of Forgiveness, and the Owner of Painful Punishment.”
And if We had made it as a Qur’an in a foreign language they would have certainly said, “Why were its verses not explained in detail?” What!
The Book in a foreign language, and the Prophet an Arab?!
Proclaim (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “It is a guidance and a cure for the believers”; and there is deafness in the ears of those who do not believe, and it is blindness upon them; as if they are being called from a place far away!
And We indeed gave the Book to Moosa, so a dispute was created regarding it; and were it not for a Word that had already gone forth from your Lord, the judgement would have been immediately passed upon them; and indeed they are in an intriguing doubt regarding it.
Whoever does good deeds, so it is for his own good, and whoever commits evil, so it is for his own harm; and your Lord does not at all oppress the bondmen.
The knowledge of the Last Day is directed towards Him; and no fruit comes out from its cover, and nor does any female conceive or give birth, but with His knowledge; and on the day when He will call out to them, “Where are My partners?”
They will say, “We have told you that none among us can testify.”
And they have lost what they used to worship before, and be sure, they do not have a place to escape.
Man does not weary of seeking goodness; and if some misfortune reaches him, he loses hope, gets disappointed.
And if We make him taste Our mercy after the hardship which befell him, he will say, “This is mine!
And I do not think that the Last Day will ever be established – and even if I am returned to my Lord, with Him is only goodness for me”; so We shall indeed inform the disbelievers of what they did; and We shall indeed make them taste a solid punishment.
And when We favour man, he turns away and goes back afar; and when some hardship reaches him, he comes with a vast prayer!
Proclaim (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “What is your opinion – if this Qur’an is from Allah and then you deny it – so who is more astray than whoever is in extreme opposition?”
We shall now show them Our signs in all the directions and within their own selves until it becomes clear to them that it is certainly the truth; is not your Lord sufficient as a Witness over all things?
Pay heed! They are certainly doubtful regarding the meeting with their Lord; pay heed!
He encompasses all things!
Ha-Meem. (Alphabets of the Arabic language – Allah, and to whomever He reveals, know their precise meanings.)
A’in-Seen-Qaf. (Alphabets of the Arabic language – Allah, and to whomever He reveals, know their precise meanings.)
This is how Allah the Most Honourable, the All Knowing sends the divine revelation to you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) and to those before you.
To Him only belongs all whatever is in the heavens and all whatever is in the earth; and He is the Supreme, the Greatest.
The heavens nearly split apart from above – and the angels say the Purity of their Lord while praising Him, and seek forgiveness for those on earth; pay heed!
Indeed Allah only is the Oft Forgiving, the Most Merciful.
And Allah is watching those who have chosen supporters besides Him; and you are not responsible for them.
And this is how We have divinely revealed to you the Qur’an in Arabic, for you to warn the people of the mother of all towns – Mecca – and those around it, and to warn of the Day of Assembling of which there is no doubt; a group is in Paradise, and another group is in hell.
And had Allah willed, He could have made them all upon one religion, but He admits whomever He wills into His mercy; and the unjust do not have any friend nor any supporter.
What! Have they appointed supporters other than Allah?
So (know that) Allah only is the Supporter, and He will revive the dead; and He is Able to do all things.
“The final decision for the matters in which you differ rests with Allah; such is my Lord – I rely on Him; and towards Him do I incline.”
The Maker of the heavens and the earth; He has created pairs for you from yourselves and pairs from the animals; He spreads your generation; nothing is like Him; and He only is the All Hearing, the All Seeing.
For Him only are the keys of the heavens and the earth; He increases the sustenance for whomever He wills and restricts it; indeed He is the All Knowing.
He has kept for you the same path of religion which He commanded Nooh, and what We divinely reveal to you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), and what We had commanded to Ibrahim and Moosa and Eisa that, “Keep the religion proper, and do not create divisions in it”; the polytheists find the matter what you call them to as intolerable; Allah chooses for His proximity whomever He wills, and guides towards Himself whoever inclines (towards Him).
And they did not cause divisions except after the knowledge had come to them, because of jealousy among themselves; and were it not for a Word that had already gone forth from your Lord, the judgement would have been passed upon them long ago; and indeed those who inherited the Book after them are in an intriguing doubt regarding it.
For this reason, call them (to Islam); and remain firm, as you are commanded to; and do not follow their desires; and say, “I accept faith in whichever Book Allah has sent down; and I am commanded to judge fairly between you; Allah is the Lord of all – ours and yours; for us are our deeds and for you are your misdeeds; there is no debate between us and you; Allah will gather all of us together; and towards Him is the return.”
And those who fight regarding Allah after the Muslims have accepted His call, their reasoning does not hold at all before their Lord, and upon them is wrath, and for them is a severe punishment.
It is Allah Who has sent down the Book with the truth, and the Scales of Justice; and what do you know – possibly the Last Day could really be near!
Those who do not believe in it are impatient for it, and those who believe in it fear it and know that indeed it is the truth; pay heed!
Those who doubt the Last Day are certainly in extreme error.
Allah is Benevolent upon His bondmen – He bestows sustenance to whomever He wills; and He only is the All Powerful, the Most Honourable.
Whoever aspires for the yield of the Hereafter – We increase its yield for him; and whoever aspires for the yield of this world – We give him part of it, and he has no portion in the Hereafter.
Or do they have associate deities who have appointed for them a religion, which Allah has not permitted?
And were it not for a Word that had already been decided, the judgement would have been passed between them here itself; and indeed for the unjust is a painful punishment.
You will see the unjust getting terrified of their own deeds, and (evil of) their deeds will certainly befall them; and (that) those who accepted faith and performed good deeds are in blossoming Gardens of Paradise; for them is whatever they wish from their Lord; this only is the great munificence (of Allah).
This is what Allah gives the glad tidings of to His bondmen who accept faith and do good deeds; say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) “I do not ask any fee from you upon this, except the love between close ones”; and whoever performs a good deed – We further increase the goodness in it for him; indeed Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Appreciative.
What! They dare say that, “He has fabricated a lie against Allah”?
And if Allah wills, He can seal your heart by His mercy and protection*; and Allah wipes out falsehood and proves the truth by His Words; indeed He knows what lies within the hearts. (* So that you may not be agonised by what they do).
And it is He Who accepts repentance from His bondmen, and pardons sins*, and knows all your deeds. (Repentance for the cardinal sins, while lesser sins are wiped out by good deeds.)
And He accepts the prayers of those who accept faith and do good deeds, and gives them a greater reward by His munificence; and for the disbelievers is a severe punishment.
And had Allah increased the sustenance for all His slaves, they would have surely caused turmoil in the land, but He sends it down by a proper assessment as He wills; indeed He is Well Aware of, Seeing His bondmen.
And it is He Who sends down the rain when they have despaired, and spreads out His mercy; and He is the Benefactor, the Most Praiseworthy.
And among His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the moving creatures dispersed in it; and He is Able to gather them whenever He wills.
And whatever calamity befalls you, is because of what your hands have earned – and there is a great deal He pardons!
And you cannot escape in the earth; and you have neither a friend nor any supporter against Allah.
And among His signs are the ships sailing on the sea, like hills.
If He wills, He can calm the winds so the ships remain still on the sea surface; indeed in this are signs for every greatly enduring, grateful person.
Or He can ruin them due to peoples’ sins and He can forgive a great deal.
And for those who dispute regarding Our signs to realise; that they do not have a place to escape to.
Whatever you have received is only for usage in the life of this world, and that which is with Allah is much better and more lasting – for those who believe and rely upon their Lord.
And (for) those who avoid cardinal sins and indecencies, and forgive (even) when they are angry.
And those who obeyed the command of their Lord and kept the prayer established; and whose affairs are with mutual consultation; and who spend in Our cause from what We have bestowed upon them.
And those who take revenge when rebellion harms them.
The retribution of a harmful deed is the harm equal to it; so whoever forgives and makes amends, so his reward is upon Allah; indeed He does not befriend the unjust.
And there is no way of reproach against those who take revenge after being wronged.
Reproach is only against those who oppress people, and wrongfully spread rebellion in the land; for them is a painful punishment.
And indeed whoever patiently endured and forgave – then indeed these are acts of great courage.
And whomever Allah sends astray, there is no friend for him against Allah; and you will see the unjust when they behold the punishment saying, “Is there a way to return?”
And you will see them being presented upon the fire, cowering with disgrace watching with concealed eyes; and the believers will say, “Indeed ruined are those who have lost themselves and their families on the Day of Resurrection”; pay heed!
Indeed the unjust are in a punishment that will never end.
And they had no friends to help them against Allah; and there is no way for one whom Allah sends astray.
Obey your Lord before the advent of a Day from Allah, which cannot be averted; you will not have any refuge on that day, nor will you be able to deny.
So if they turn away from you, We have not sent you as a guardian over them; upon you is nothing but to convey (the message); and when We make man taste some mercy from Us, he rejoices upon it; and if some harm reaches them because of what their own hands have sent before, thereupon man is ungrateful!
For Allah only is the kingship of the heavens and the earth; He creates whatever He wills; He may bestow daughters to whomever He wills, and sons to whomever He wills.
Or may mix them, the sons and daughters; and may make barren whomever He wills; indeed He is All Knowing, Able.
And it is not for any human that Allah may speak to him except as a divine revelation or while the human is on this side of the veil of greatness, or that He sends an angel to reveal by His permission, whatever He wills; indeed He is Supreme, Wise.
And this is how We sent the divine revelation to you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) – a life giving thing, by Our command; neither did you know the Book nor the detailed commands of religion, but We have made this Qur’an a light by which We guide whomever We will from Our bondmen; and indeed you surely do guide to the Straight Path.
The path of Allah – the One to Whom only belongs all whatever is in the heavens and all whatever is in the earth; pay heed!
Towards Allah only do all matters return.
Ha-Meem. (Alphabets of the Arabic language – Allah, and to whomever He reveals, know their precise meanings.)
By oath of the clear Qur’an.
We have indeed sent it as a Qur’an in the Arabic language, so that you may understand.
And the Qur’an is undoubtedly, in the Original Book with Us, surely the exalted, full of wisdom.
So shall We divert the advice away from you, because you are a nation that exceeds the limits?
And how many Prophets We did send among the earlier people!
And whenever any Prophet came to them, they only mocked at him.
We therefore destroyed the people who were more forceful than these, and the example of the earlier ones has already gone by.
And if you ask them, “Who has created the heavens and the earth?”, they will surely say, “They are created by the Most Honourable, the All Knowing.”
The One Who made the earth a bed you, and made roads for you in it, so that you may be guided.
And Who sent down water from the sky with a proper measure, so We revived a dead city with it; this is how you will be taken out.
And the One Who created all pairs, and made the ships and cattle as rides for you.
So that you may properly mount their backs, and may remember your Lord’s favour when you have mounted them, and say, “Purity is to Him, Who has given this ride in our control, and we did not have the strength for it.”
“And indeed we have to return to our Lord.”
And from* His bondmen, they appointed a portion for Him; man is indeed an open ingrate. (* Appointed some of His creation as His sons and daughters).
Has He chosen daughters for Himself from His creation, and selected only sons for you?
And if one of them is given the glad tidings of what he professes regarding the Most Gracious, his face blackens and he is mournful!
And (do they chose for Him) one who is brought up among ornaments, and cannot express herself clearly in debate?
And they appoint the angels, who are the bondmen of the Most Gracious, as females; were they present at the time of the angels’ creation?
Their declaration will be now recorded and they will be questioned.
And they say, “If the Most Gracious had willed, we would not have worshipped them!”
They do not know its truth at all; they only make guesses.
Or have We given them some Book before this, to which they hold fast?
Rather they said, “We found our forefathers upon a religion, and we are following their footsteps.”
And similarly, whenever We sent a Herald of Warning before you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) into any town, its wealthy people said, “We found our forefathers upon a religion, and we are behind their footsteps.”
The prophet said, “What!
Even if I bring to you a path better than what you found your forefathers following?”; they said, “We do not believe in whatever you have been sent with.”
So We took revenge from them – therefore see what sort of fate befell those who denied!
And when Ibrahim said to his father and his people, “I have no relation whatsoever with your deities.”
“Except Him Who has created me, for He will soon direct me.” (To my place of migration.)
And Ibrahim kept this declaration among his progeny, in order that they may desist.
In fact I gave them and their forefathers the usage of this world until the truth and the Noble Messenger who conveyed the message clearly, came to them.
And when the truth came to them they said, “This is magic, and we disbelieve in it.”
And they said, “Why was the Qur’an not sent down upon some chieftain of these two great towns?” (The chiefs of Mecca and Taif).
Are they the distributors of your Lord’s mercy?
We have distributed among them their comforts in the life of this world, and gave high status to some over others so that they mock at each other; and the mercy of your Lord is better than all what they hoard.
And were it not for that all people be on one religion, We would have made for the disbelievers of the Most Gracious, roofs and stairs of silver which they would climb.
And doors of silver for their houses and couches of silver upon which they would recline.
And diverse adornments; and all this is usage only of the life of this world; and the Hereafter with your Lord, is for the pious.
And whoever is averse to the Remembrance of the Most Gracious, We appoint a devil upon him, who stays with him.
And indeed those devils prevent them from the Straight Path, and they think they are on guidance!
To the extent that when the disbeliever will be brought to Us, he will say to his devil, “Alas – if only there was the distance* of east and west, between you and me!” – so what an evil companion** he is! (* Had I not listened to you. **They will be bound together in chains.)
(It will be said to them) “And you will not benefit from them this day, whereas you are unjust – for you are all partners in the punishment.”
So will you make the deaf listen or show the path to the blind, and to those who are in open error? (The disbelievers whose hearts are sealed, are deaf and blind to the truth).
So if We take you away, We shall then indeed take revenge from them.
Or show you what We have promised them – We therefore have complete control over them.
Therefore hold fast to what We have divinely revealed to you; indeed you are upon the Straight Path. (The Holy Prophets can never go astray).
And it is undoubtedly an honour for you and your people; and you will soon be questioned.
And ask them – did any of the Noble Messengers We sent before you, appoint any other Gods except the Most Gracious, whom they used to worship?
And indeed We sent Moosa along with Our signs towards Firaun and his chieftains – he therefore said, “Indeed I am a Noble Messenger of the Lord of the Creation.”
So when he brought Our signs to them, they started mocking at them!
And all the signs We showed them were always greater than the earlier ones; and We seized them with calamities, so that they may return.
And they said, “O you magician! Pray for us to your Lord, by the means of His covenant which is with you; we will certainly come to guidance.”
So when We averted the calamity from them, they immediately broke the promise!
And said Firaun, “O my people! Is not the kingdom of Egypt for me, and these rivers that flow beneath me?
So do you not see?”
“Or that I am better than him, for he is lowly – and he does not seem to talk plainly.”
“So why was he not bestowed with armlets of gold? Or angels should have come with him staying at his side!”
So when he had brainwashed his people, they followed him; indeed they were a disobedient nation.
So when they made Us wrathful, We took revenge from them – We therefore drowned all of them.
So We made them a bygone fable and a lesson for the latter generations.
And when the example of the son of Maryam is given, your people laugh at it!
And they say, “Are our deities better or he?”
They did not say this to you except to unjustly argue; in fact they are a quarrelsome people.
He is purely a bondman (of Ours), whom We have favoured upon, and We made him an extraordinary example for the Descendants of Israel.
And if We willed, We could have established angels on the earth instead of you.
And indeed Eisa is a sign* of the Last Day, therefore do not ever doubt in the Last Day, and obey Me**; this is the Straight Path. (* The advent of Prophet Eisa to earth for the second time. ** By obeying the Noble Messenger.)
And do not ever let the devil stop you; he is indeed your open enemy.
And when Eisa came to them with clear signs, he said, “I have come to you with wisdom, and to explain to you some of the matters regarding which you dispute; therefore fear Allah, and obey me.”
“Allah is indeed my Lord, and yours – therefore worship Him; this is the Straight Path.”
Then the groups differed amongst themselves; therefore ruin is for the unjust by the punishment of an agonising day.
What are they waiting for – except the Last Day, that it may suddenly come upon them while they are unaware?
Close friends will turn into enemies of one another on that Day, except the pious.
To such will be said, “O My bondmen! This day there shall be no fear upon you, nor any grief.”
Those who believed in Our signs, and were Muslims.
“Enter Paradise – you and your wives – and you will be honoured guests.”
“Rounds of golden cups and wine will be presented upon them; and in it is whatever the hearts wish for, and what pleases the eye; and you will stay in it forever.”
“And this is the Paradise which is bequeathed to you, because of your deeds.”
“For you are many fruits in it, for you to eat therefrom.”
Indeed the criminals will stay in the punishment of hell forever.
And it will never be lightened upon them, and they will remain in it devastated.
And We did not oppress them at all, but they themselves were unjust.
And they will cry out, “O Malik*, ask your Lord to finish us!”
He will answer, “Rather you are to stay (forever).” (*The guard of hell)
Indeed We have brought the Truth to you, but most of you detest the Truth.
Do they assume that they have made their work thorough?
So We shall make Our work thorough.
Do they fancy that We do not listen to their whispers and their counselling? Why not, We surely do!
And Our angels are with them, writing down.
Proclaim (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “If supposedly, the Most Gracious had an offspring* – I would be the first to worship!” (*Which is impossible)
Purity is to the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of the Throne, from all what they fabricate.
Therefore leave them to utter vile speech and to play, until they confront the day which they are promised.
And only He is the God of the heavenly creation and the God of the earthly creation; and He only is the Wise, the All Knowing.
And Most Auspicious is He, for Whom is the kingship of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them; and only with Him is the knowledge of the Last Day; and towards Him you are to return.
And those whom they worship besides Allah do not have the right of intercession – the right of intercession is only for those who testify to the Truth and have knowledge.
And if you ask them as to Who created them, they will surely answer “Allah” – so where are they reverting?
And by oath of the saying of My Prophet “O my Lord!
These people do not accept faith!”
Therefore excuse them and proclaim, “Peace”; for they will soon come to know.
Ha-Meem. (Alphabets of the Arabic language – Allah, and to whomever He reveals, know their precise meanings.)
By oath of this clear Book.
We have indeed sent it down in a blessed night – indeed it is We Who warn.
During it are distributed all the works of wisdom.
By a command from Us – indeed it is We Who send.
A mercy from your Lord; indeed He only is the All Hearing, the All Knowing.
The Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them; if you people believe.
There is no worship except for Him – He gives life and causes death; your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers.
Rather they are in doubt, playing.
So you await the day when the sky will bring forth a visible smoke. –
Which will envelop the people; this is a painful punishment.
Thereupon they will say, “O our Lord! Remove the punishment from us – we now accept faith.”
How is it possible for them to accept guidance, whereas a Noble Messenger who speaks clearly has already come to them?
Whereas they had then turned away from him and said, “He is a madman, tutored!”?
We now remove the punishment for some days – so you will again commit the same.
The day when We will seize with the greatest seizure – We will indeed take revenge.
And before them We indeed tried the people of Firaun, and an Honourable Noble Messenger came to them.
Who said, “Give the bondmen of Allah into my custody; I am indeed a trustworthy Noble Messenger for you.”
And saying, “And do not rebel against Allah; I have brought a clear proof to you.”
“And I take the refuge of my Lord and yours, against your stoning me.”
“And if you do not believe in me, then have no relation with me.”
He therefore prayed to his Lord, “These are a guilty nation!”
We commanded him, “Journey with My bondmen in a part of the night – you will be pursued.”
“And leave the sea as it is, parted in several places; indeed that army will be drowned.”
How many gardens and water-springs they left behind!
And fields and grand palaces!
And favours amongst which they were rejoicing!
That is what We did; and We made another nation their heirs.
So the heavens and the earth did not weep for them, and they were not given respite.
And indeed We rescued the Descendants of Israel from a disgraceful torture.
From Firaun; he was indeed proud, among the transgressors.
And We knowingly chose them, among all others of their time.
And We gave them signs in which lay clear favours.
Indeed these disbelievers proclaim; –
“There is nothing except our dying just once, and we will not be raised.”
“Therefore bring back our forefathers, if you are truthful!”
Are they better, or the people of Tubba? And those who were before them?
We destroyed them; they were indeed criminals.
And We did not create the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them, just for play.
We did not create them except with the truth, but most of them do not know.
Indeed the Day of Decision is the appointment for all of them.
The day on which, no friends will benefit each other at all, nor will they be helped. (Except those who are pious – see verse 43:67)
Except those upon whom Allah has mercy; indeed He only is the Most Honourable, the Most Merciful.
Indeed the tree of Zaqqum, –
Is the food of the sinners.
Like molten copper; it churns in their bellies.
Like the churning of boiling water.
“Seize him, and forcibly drag him right to the blazing fire.”
“Then pour on his head the punishment of boiling water.”
Saying “Taste it!
Indeed you only are the most honourable, the dignified!”
“Indeed this is what you used to doubt about.”
Indeed the pious are in a place of peace.
In Gardens and water-springs.
They will be dressed in fine silk and embroidery, facing one another (on thrones).
So it is; and We have wedded them to maidens with gorgeous eyes.
In it they will ask for all kinds of fruit, with safety.
They will not taste death again in it, except their former death; and Allah has saved them from the punishment of fire.
By the munificence of your Lord; this is the great success.
And We have made this Qur’an easy in your language, for them to understand.
Therefore wait (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) – they too are waiting.
Ha; Meem. (Alphabets of the Arabic language – Allah, and to whomever He reveals, know their precise meanings.)
The sending down of the Book is from Allah, the Most Honourable, the Wise.
Indeed in the heavens and the earth are signs for believers.
And in your creation, and all the creatures He scatters in the earth – in them are signs for the people who are certain.
And in the alternation of night and day, and in the means of sustenance – water – which Allah sends down from the sky whereby He gave life to the earth after its death, and in the movement of the winds – (in all these) are signs for people of intellect.
These are the verses of Allah which We recite to you with the truth; so forsaking Allah and His signs, what will they believe in?
Ruin is for every great slanderer, excessive sinner.
Who hears the verses of Allah which are recited to him, then remains stubborn, proud, as if he did not hear them; therefore give him the glad tidings of a painful punishment.
And when he comes to know about any of the verses, he mocks at it; for them is a disgraceful punishment.
Hell is after them; and what they have earned will not benefit them at all, nor those whom they have chosen as supporters besides Allah; and for them is a terrible punishment.
This is the (true) guidance; and for those who disbelieve in the verses of their Lord is the severest of painful punishments.
It is Allah Who has subjected the sea for you so that ships may sail upon it by His command, and for you to seek His munificence, and so that you may give thanks.
And has subjected for you all whatever is in the heavens and in the earth, by His command; indeed in this are signs for people who ponder.
Tell the believers to ignore those who do not expect the days of Allah, in order that Allah may give a nation the reward of what they used to earn.
Whoever does a good deed, so it is for his own good; and whoever commits evil, does for his own harm; and you will then be returned towards your Lord.
And indeed We gave the Descendants of Israel the Book, and the rule, and the Prophethood, and gave good things for sustenance and gave them superiority over all others of their time.
And We gave them clear proofs in the command; so they did not differ except after the knowledge had come to them – due to jealousy among themselves; indeed your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning the matter in which they differ.
We then placed you (O dear prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) upon the clear path of the command, therefore continue following it and do not listen to the desires of the ignorant.
Indeed they cannot benefit you at all against Allah; and indeed the unjust are the friends of each other; and Allah is the Friend of the pious.
This is an enlightenment for mankind, and a guidance and mercy for the people of faith.
Do those who commit evil assume that We will make them equal to those who believe and do good deeds, therefore both becoming equal in life and death?
What an evil judgement they impose!
And Allah has created the heavens and the earth with the truth, and so that every soul is repaid for what it has earned, and they will not be wronged.
Just look at him who makes his desire as his God, and Allah has sent him astray despite his having knowledge, and set a seal upon his ears and his heart, and a covering upon his eyes; so who will guide him after Allah?
So do you not ponder?
And they said, “There is nothing except our life of this world – we die and we live – and nothing destroys us except the passage of time”; and they do not have any knowledge of it; they only make guesses.
And when Our clear verses are recited to them, their only argument is, “Bring back our forefathers, if you are truthful!”
Proclaim (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “It is Allah Who gives you life, then will give you death, then will gather you all on the Day of Resurrection in which there is no doubt, but most people do not know.”
And to Allah only belongs the kingship of the heavens and the earth; and when the Last Day is established – on that day the followers of falsehood will suffer loss.
And you will see every group down on its knees; every group will be called towards its book of deeds; “This day you will be repaid for what you did.”
“This Book of Ours speaks against you with the truth; indeed We had been recording all what you did.”
So those who believed and did good deeds – their Lord will admit them into His mercy; this is the clear triumph.
And to those who disbelieved, it will be said “Was it not that Our verses were recited to you?
In response you were haughty and were a guilty people.”
“And when it was said, ‘Indeed Allah’s promise is true and there is no doubt regarding the Last Day”, you used to say, ‘We do not know what the Last Day is – we think it is nothing except an imagination, and we are not convinced.’”
And the evils of their deeds appeared to them, and the punishment they used to mock at encompassed them.
And it will be said, “This day We shall forsake you, the way you had forgotten the confronting of this day of yours – and your destination is the fire, and you do not have any supporters.”
“This is because you mocked at the signs of Allah, and the worldly life deceived you”; so this day they are not to be removed from the fire, nor will anyone seek amends from them.
So all praise is for Allah only, the Lord of the heavens and the Lord of the earth, the Lord of the Creation!
And for Him only is the Greatness, in the heavens and in the earth; and He only is the Most Honourable, the Wise.
Ha-Meem. (Alphabets of the Arabic language – Allah, and to whomever He reveals, know their precise meanings.)
The sending down of this Book is from Allah the Most Honourable, the Wise.
We did not create the heavens and the earth and all that is between them except with the truth, and for a fixed term; and the disbelievers have turned away from what they are warned!
Proclaim, (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “What is your opinion – regarding those whom you worship other than Allah – show me which part of the earth they have created, or do they own any portion of the heavens?
Bring to me a Book preceding this (Qur’an), or some remnants of knowledge, if you are truthful.”
And who is more astray than one who worships those, instead of Allah, who cannot listen to their prayer until* the Day of Resurrection, and who do not even know of their worship! (Will never listen.)
And on the day when people are gathered, they will become their enemies, and will reject their worshippers. (The idols will give testimony against the polytheists.)
And when Our clear verses are recited to them, the disbelievers say regarding the Truth that has come to them, “This is an obvious magic!”
What!
They dare say, “He has fabricated it”?
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “If I have fabricated it, then (I know that) you have no power to support me against Allah; He well knows the matters you are involved in; He is Sufficient as a Witness between me and you; and He only is the Oft Forgiving, the Most Merciful.”
Say, “I am not something new* among the Noble Messengers, nor do I know (on my own) what will happen to me** or with you; I only follow that which is divinely revealed to me, and I am purely a Herald of clear warning. (* I am like the earlier ones. ** My knowledge comes due to divine revelations.)
Say, “What is your opinion – if the Qur’an is from Allah and you have rejected faith in it, and a witness among the Descendants of Israel has already testified upon this and accepted faith, while you became arrogant?
Indeed Allah does not guide the unjust.”
And the disbelievers said regarding the Muslims, “If there were any good in it, the Muslims would not have surpassed us in achieving it!”; and since they did not receive guidance with it, they will now say, “This is an old slander.”
And whereas before this exists the Book of Moosa, a guide and a mercy; and this is a Book giving testimony, in the Arabic language, to warn the unjust; and to give glad tidings to the virtuous.
Indeed those who said, “Allah is our Lord”, and then remained steadfast – upon them is neither any fear nor shall they grieve.
They are the People of Paradise, abiding in it forever; the reward of their deeds.
And We have commanded man to be good towards parents; his mother bore him with hardship, and delivered him with hardship; and carrying him and weaning him is for thirty months; until when he* reached maturity and became forty years of age, he said, “My Lord! Inspire me to be thankful for the favours you bestowed upon me and my parents, and that I may perform the deeds pleasing to You, and keep merit among my offspring; I have inclined towards you and I am a Muslim.” (* This verse was revealed concerning S. Abu Bakr – the first caliph, R. A. A)
These are the ones whose good deeds We will accept, and overlook their shortfalls – among the People of Paradise; a true promise which is being given to them.
And the one who said to his parents, “Uff – I am fed up with both of you! What!
You promise me that I will be raised again whereas generations have passed away before me?” And they both seek Allah’s help and say to him, “May you be ruined, accept faith!
Indeed Allah’s promise is true”; he therefore answers, “This is nothing except stories of former people.”
It is these upon whom the Word has proved true, among the nations that passed away before them, of jinns and men; indeed they were losers.
And for all persons are ranks according to their deeds; and so that He may repay them in full for their deeds, and they will not be wronged.
And on the day when the disbelievers will be presented upon the fire; it will be said to them, “You have wasted your portion of the good things in the life of this world and enjoyed them; so this day you will be repaid with the disgraceful punishment, the recompense of your wrongfully priding yourself in the land, and because you used to disobey.”
And remember the fellowman of the tribe of A’ad; when he warned his nation in the Ahqaf* – and indeed Heralds of warning passed away before and after him – that, “Do not worship anyone except Allah; indeed I fear the punishment of a Great Day upon you. (* A country among sand dunes.)
They said, “Have you come to us in order to turn us away from our Gods?
Therefore bring upon us what you promise us, if you are truthful.”
He said, “Its knowledge is only with Allah; and I convey to you the messages of my Lord, but I perceive that you are an ignorant nation.”
So when they saw the punishment coming towards their valleys, spread like a cloud on the horizon, they said, “That is a cloud which will shower rain upon us”; said Hud “In fact this is what you were being impatient for; a windstorm carrying a painful punishment.”
“That destroys all things by the command of its Lord” – so at morning none could be seen except their empty houses; this is the sort of punishment We mete out to the guilty.
And We had indeed given them the means which We have not given you, and made ears and eyes and hearts for them; so their ears and eyes and hearts did not benefit them at all because they used to deny the signs of Allah, and the punishment they used to mock at encompassed them.
And We indeed destroyed townships surrounding you, and brought several signs so that they may desist.
So why did they – the ones whom they had chosen as Gods as a means of attaining Allah’s proximity – not help them?
In fact the disbelievers lost them; and this is just their slander and fabrication.
And when We sent a number of jinns towards you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), listening attentively to the Qur’an; so when they presented themselves there, they said to each other, “Listen quietly!”; and when the recitation finished, they turned back to their people, giving them warning.
They said, “O our people! We have indeed heard a Book, sent down after Moosa, which confirms the Books preceding it, and guides towards the Truth and the Straight Path.”
“O our people! Listen to Allah’s caller and accept faith in Him, so that He may forgive you some of your sins and save you from the painful punishment.”
“And whoever does not listen to Allah’s caller cannot escape in the earth, and he has no supporters against Allah; they are in open error.”
Have they not realised that Allah, Who did not tire in creating the heavens and the earth and in creating them, is Able to revive the dead? Surely yes, why not?
Indeed He is Able to do all things.
And on the day when the disbelievers are presented upon the fire; it will be said, “Is this not a reality?”
They will answer, “By oath of our Lord, surely yes, why not?”; it will be said, “Therefore taste the punishment, the recompense of your disbelief.”
Therefore patiently endure (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) like the courageous Noble Messengers had endured, and do not be impatient for them; on the day when they see what they are promised, it will be as if they had not stayed on earth except part of a day; this is to be conveyed; will anyone be destroyed, except the disobedient?
Allah has destroyed the deeds of those who disbelieved and prevented from Allah’s way.
And those who accepted faith and did good deeds and believed in what has been sent down upon Mohammed (peace and blessings be upon him) – and that is the truth from their Lord – Allah has relieved them of some of their evils and refined their condition.
This is because the disbelievers followed falsehood and the believers followed the Truth which is from their Lord; this is how Allah illustrates the examples of people to them.
So when you confront the disbelievers, strike at their necks; until when you have slain them in plenty, tie them up firmly; then after that, you may either release them as a favour or take ransom, until the war lays down its ordeal; this is it; and had Allah willed He Himself could have taken revenge from them, but this is to test some of you with others; and Allah will surely never waste the deeds of those who were killed in His way.
He will soon guide them (towards Paradise) and make them succeed.
And He will admit them into Paradise – they have been made familiar with it.
O People who Believe! If you help the religion of Allah, He will help you and will stabilise you.
And for those who disbelieve – may they be ruined, and may Allah destroy all their deeds!
This is because they disliked what Allah has sent down – He has therefore squandered all their deeds.
So did they not travel in the land to see what sort of fate befell those who preceded them?
Allah poured ruin upon them; and for the disbelievers are several like it.
This is because Allah is the Supporter of the believers, whereas the disbelievers do not have any supporter.
Allah will indeed admit those who believed and did good deeds into Gardens beneath which rivers flow; and the disbelievers enjoy, and they eat like the cattle eat, and their destination is in the fire.
And many a township existed which was stronger than your town (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) – those who removed you from your town – We destroyed them, so they do not have a supporter!
So will one who is upon on a clear proof from his Lord, ever be like any of those whose evil deeds are made to appear good to them and they follow their own desires?
A description of the Garden which is promised to the pious; in it are rivers of water which shall never pollute; and rivers of milk the taste of which shall never change; and rivers of wine delicious to drink; and rivers of purified honey; and in it for them are fruits of all kinds, and the forgiveness of their Lord; so will such ever be equal to those who are to stay in the fire for ever and who will be given boiling water to drink so that it tears their guts apart?
And among them are some who listen to what you say; until when they go away from you, they say to those who have been given knowledge, “What did he say now?”; they are those whose hearts Allah has sealed, and they follow their own desires.
And those who attained the right path – Allah increases the guidance for them and bestows their piety to them.
So what are they waiting for, except that the Last Day suddenly come upon them?
For its signs have already appeared; so when it does come, of what use is their realising it?
Therefore know (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) that there is none worthy of worship except Allah, and seek the forgiveness of sins of your close ones and for the common believing men and women; and Allah knows your movements during the day and your resting during the night.
And the Muslims say, “Why was not a chapter sent down?”
So when a positive chapter was sent down, and war was commanded in it, you will see those in whose hearts is a disease looking at you with the dazed looks of a dying man; so it would be better for them. –
To obey and speak good; so when the manifest command came – it would have been better for them if they had remained faithful to Allah.
So do you* portray that if you get governance, you would spread chaos in the land and sever your relations? (* The hypocrites)
It is these whom Allah has cursed, so He made them deaf to the Truth and blinded their eyes.
So do they not ponder the Qur’an deeply, or are there locks on some of their hearts?
Indeed those who turn back after the guidance had become clear to them – Satan has deceived them; and made them optimistic of living for ages.
This is because they said to those who dislike what Allah has sent down, “We will obey you regarding one matter*”; and Allah knows their secrets. (* To fight against the Holy Prophet).
So how (dreadful) will it be when the angels remove their souls, striking at their faces and their backs!
This is because they followed the matter which displeases Allah, and they disliked what pleases Him – He therefore squandered away all their deeds.
What! Do they, in whose hearts is a disease, fancy that Allah will not expose concealed enmities?
And if We will, We can show them to you so that you may recognise them by their faces; and you will surely recognise them by the way they talk; and Allah knows your deeds.
And We shall indeed test you until We make known the warriors and the steadfast among you – and to test your proclamations.
Indeed those who disbelieved and prevented others from Allah’s way, and opposed the Noble Messenger after the guidance had become clear to them – they cannot harm Allah in the least; and soon He will squander away their deeds.
O People who Believe! Obey Allah and obey the Noble Messenger, and do not render your deeds void.
Indeed those who disbelieved and prevented others from Allah’s way, and then died as disbelievers – so Allah will never forgive them.
Therefore do not relax, nor call towards truce by yourself; and it is you who will dominate; and Allah is with you, and He will never cause a loss in your deeds.
The worldly life is just a sport and pastime; and if you accept faith and be pious, He will bestow your rewards to you, and not at all ask you for your wealth.
Were He to ask it from you, and ask in plenty, you would be miserly, and the miserliness would expose the filth within your hearts.
Yes, undoubtedly it is you who are being called, that you may spend in Allah’s way; so some among you act miserly; and whoever is miserly, is being a miser upon himself; and Allah is the Independent (Wealthy – Not requiring anything), whereas you all are needy; and if you renege, He will replace you with other people – and they will not be like you.
We have indeed, for your sake (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), bestowed a clear victory.
So that Allah may forgive, for your sake, the sins of those before you and those after you, and complete His favours upon you, and to show you the Straight Path.
And so that Allah may provide you a great help.
It is He Who instilled peace in the hearts of the believers, so that it may increase their strength of conviction; and to Allah only belong the armies of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is All Knowing, Wise.
In order to admit the believing men and believing women into Gardens beneath which rivers flow, in which they will abide, and to relieve them of their misdeeds; and this, in Allah’s sight, is the greatest success.
And to punish the hypocrite men and hypocrite women, and the polytheist men and polytheist women, who think evilly about Allah; upon them only is the evil cycle of misfortune; and Allah has wreaked anger upon them, and has cursed them, and has prepared hell for them; and what an evil destination.
And to Allah only belong the armies of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is Most Honourable, Wise.
We have indeed sent you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) as a present witness and a Herald of glad tidings and warnings. (The Holy Prophet is a witness from Allah.)
In order that you, O people, may accept faith in Allah and His Noble Messenger, and honour and revere the Noble Messenger; and may say the Purity of Allah, morning and evening. (To honour the Holy Prophet – peace and blessings be upon him – is part of faith.
Those who swear allegiance to you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), do indeed in fact swear allegiance to Allah; Allah's Hand* of Power is above their hands; so whoever breaches his oath, has breached his own greater promise; and whoever fulfils the covenant he has with Allah – so very soon Allah will bestow upon him a great reward. (Used as a metaphor.)
The ignorant ones who had stayed behind will now say to you, “Our wealth and our families prevented us from going by keeping us pre-occupied, therefore seek forgiveness for us”; they utter with their tongues what is not in their hearts; say, “So does anyone have any control over you against Allah, if He wills to harm you or provide you benefit?
In fact Allah is Aware of what you do.”
“Rather you had assumed that the Noble Messenger and the Muslims will never return to their homes, and you thought this as good within your hearts, whereas you had thought evilly; and you were a people about to be ruined.”
And whoever does not accept faith in Allah and His Noble Messenger – We have indeed kept prepared a blazing fire for disbelievers.
And for Allah only is the kingship of the heavens and the earth; He may forgive whomever He wills, and punish whomever He wills; and Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
Those who had stayed behind will now say, “When you go to receive the war booty, let us also go with you”; they wish to change the Words of Allah; say “You shall never come with us – this is already decreed by Allah”; so they will now say, “But rather you envy us”; in fact they never understood except a little.
Say to the ignorant who stayed behind, “You will soon be called against a nation of great military strength – to fight against them or that they become Muslims; so if you obey, Allah will give you an excellent reward; and if you turn away, the way you had turned away before, He will mete out a painful punishment to you.”
There is no reproach upon the blind, nor reproach against the lame, nor reproach upon the sick; and whoever obeys Allah and His Noble Messenger – Allah will admit him into Gardens beneath which rivers flow; and whoever turns away – He will mete out a painful punishment to him.
Indeed Allah was truly pleased with the believers when they swore allegiance to you beneath the tree – so He knew what was in their hearts – He therefore sent down peace upon them, and rewarded them with an imminent victory.
And plenty of war booty, to take; and Allah is Most Honourable, Wise.
Allah has promised you plenty of booty which you will take, and has bestowed this to you quickly, and restrained peoples’ hands from you; and in order that it may be a sign for the believers, and to guide you on the Straight Path.
And one more, not within your capacity, is within Allah’s hold; and Allah is Able to do all things.
And if the disbelievers were to fight you, they will turn away and flee, and then they will not find any supporter nor any aide.
The tradition of Allah, ongoing since before; and you will not find the tradition of Allah changing.
And it is He Who restrained their hands from you, and your hands from them in the valley of Mecca, after having given you control over them; and Allah sees all what you do.
It was these who disbelieved and prevented you from the Sacred Mosque, and stopped the sacrificial animals from reaching their place; and were it not for some Muslim men and Muslim women, whom you do not know – lest you may crush them and unintentionally incur some violation due to them – Allah would have permitted you to slay them; this relief for them, is so that Allah may admit into His mercy whomever He wills; and had they been separated, We would have indeed punished the disbelievers among them with a painful punishment.
Whereas the disbelievers had set up in their hearts an obstinacy – the same obstinacy of the days of ignorance – so Allah sent down His solace upon His Noble Messenger and upon the believers, and decreed upon them the words of piety, and they were more deserving and suitable for it; and Allah is the All Knowing.
Allah has indeed made the truthful dream of His Noble Messenger, come true; indeed you will all enter the Sacred Mosque, if Allah wills, in safety – with your heads shaven or hair cut short – without fear; so He knows what you do not know, and has therefore ordained another imminent victory before this.
It is He Who has sent His Noble Messenger with the guidance and the true religion, in order to make it prevail over all other religions; and Allah is sufficient as a Witness.
(The Holy Prophet is a light from Allah.)
Mohammed (peace and blessings be upon him) is the Noble Messenger of Allah; and his companions are stern with the disbelievers and merciful among themselves – you will see them bowing and falling in prostration, seeking Allah’s munificence and His pleasure; their signs are on their faces, from the effects of their prostration; this trait of theirs is mentioned in the Taurat; and their trait is mentioned in the Injeel; like a cultivation that sprouted its shoot, then strengthened it, then thickened and then stood firm upon its stem, pleasing the farmer – in order to enrage the disbelievers with them; Allah has promised forgiveness and a great reward to those among them who have faith and do good deeds.
O People who Believe! Do not advance ahead of Allah and His Noble Messenger, and fear Allah; indeed Allah is All Hearing, All Knowing.
Do not raise your voices higher than the voice of the Prophet, nor speak to him loudly the way you shout to one another, lest your deeds go to waste whilst you are unaware. (Faith will go waste due to the slightest disrespect towards the Holy Prophet – peace and blessings be upon him.
Indeed those who suppress their voices in the presence of Allah’s Noble Messenger, are the ones whose hearts Allah has tested for piety; for them is forgiveness, and a great reward.
Indeed most of those who call you from outside the chambers do not have sense.
And had they been patient until you yourself came out to them, it would be better for them; and Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
O People who Believe! If any miscreant brings you some tidings, verify it, lest you unknowingly cause suffering to some people, and then remain repenting for what you did.
And know that Allah’s Noble Messenger is among you; in most of the affairs, were he to listen to you, you would surely fall into hardship, but Allah has made faith dear to you and has instilled it in your hearts, and has made disbelief and rebellion and disobedience abhorred by you; it is people like these who are on guidance.
The munificence and favour of Allah; and Allah is All Knowing, Wise.
And if two groups of Muslims fight against each other, reconcile them; and if one of them oppresses the other, fight against the oppressor till it returns to the command of Allah; then if it returns, reconcile between them with justice, and be fair; indeed Allah loves the equitable.
The Muslims are brothers to each other, therefore make peace between your two brothers and fear Allah, so that you may gain mercy. (The entire Muslim nation is a single brotherhood, without any distinction for caste, creed or colour.)
O People who Believe!
Men must not ridicule other men for it could be that the ridiculed are better than the mockers, nor must the women ridicule other women for the ridiculed women may be better than the mockers; and do not insult one another, nor assign evil nicknames; how base it is to be called a sinner after being a Muslim!
And whoever does not repent – then it is they who are unjust.
O People who Believe!
Avoid excessive assumptions; indeed assumption sometimes becomes a sin, and do not seek faults, and do not slander one another; would any one among you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother?
So you will hate that!
And fear Allah; indeed Allah is Most Acceptor of Repentance, Most Merciful.
O mankind! We have indeed created you from one man and one woman, and have made you into various nations and tribes so that you may know one another; indeed the more honourable among you, in the sight of Allah, is one who is more pious among you; indeed Allah is All Knowing, All Aware.
(Piety is the basis of honour in Allah’s sight.)
The ignorant said, “We have accepted faith”; say, (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “You have surely not accepted faith, but you should say ‘We have submitted’, for faith has not yet entered your hearts; and if you obey* Allah and His Noble Messenger, He will not reduce the reward of any of your deeds; indeed Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.” (* By accepting faith and then obeying the commands).
The true believers are only those who accepted faith in Allah and His Noble Messenger and then did not have any doubt, and fought with their wealth and their lives in Allah’s way; it is they who are the truthful.
Proclaim (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “Are you teaching Allah your own religion? Whereas Allah knows all whatever is in the heavens and all whatever is in the earth; and Allah knows all things.”
They portray that they are doing a great favour to you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) by having become Muslims; say, “Do not think that you have done me a favour by accepting Islam; in fact Allah has bestowed a favour upon you, for He guided you to Islam, if you are truthful.”
Indeed Allah knows all the hidden of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is seeing your deeds.
Qaf; by oath of the Glorious Qur’an.
Rather they were shocked that a Herald of Warning came to them from among themselves, so the disbelievers said, “This is something really strange.”
“When we are dead and have turned to dust, will we be raised again?
That return is impossible!”
We know all what the earth decreases from them; and with Us is a Book that retains.
In fact they denied the Truth when it came to them, so they are now in a dilemma.
So did they not see the sky above them – how We have made it and beautified it, and there are no cracks in it?
And (how) We have spread the earth, and placed mountains as anchors in it, and have grown all kinds of beautiful pairs in it?
A perception and an understanding, for every bondman who inclines.
And We sent down the auspicious water from the sky, therefore producing gardens with it, and the grain that is harvested.
And high date-palms with lush fruit.
As sustenance for the bondmen; and with it We revived a dead city; this is how you will be raised.
Before these, the people of Nooh had denied, and so did the dwellers of Rass and the Thamud.
And the tribe of A’ad, and Firaun, and the fellowmen of Lut.
And the Dwellers of the Woods, and the people of Tubb’a; each one of them one denied the Noble Messengers, so My promised punishment proved true.
So did We tire by creating the first time?
Rather they doubt being created again.
And indeed We have created man and We know what his soul instils in him; and We are nearer to him than the hearts artery.
When the two receiving angels receive from him, one seated on the right and one on the left.
He does not utter a single word, without a ready recorder seated next to him.
And the hardship of death came with the truth; “This is what you were escaping from!”
And the Trumpet was blown; “This is the Day of the promised punishment.”
And every soul came, along with a herder and a witness.
“You were indeed neglectful of this, so We have removed the veil for you, and your eyesight is sharp this day.”
And his accompanying angel said, “This is the record of your deeds, available with me.”
It will be said to the angels, “Both of you fling every excessive ungrateful, stubborn person into hell.”
“The one who excessively prevented from virtue, the transgressor, the doubtful.”
“The one who appointed another God along with Allah – so both of you fling him into the severe punishment.”
His accompanying devil said, “Our Lord! I did not cause him to rebel, but he himself was in extreme error.”
He will say, “Do not dispute before Me – I had already warned you of the punishment.”
“With Me, the decree does not change, and nor do I oppress the bondmen.”
The day when We will ask hell, “Are you filled up?” and it will answer, “Are there some more?”
And Paradise will be brought close to the pious, not far away from them.
This is what you are promised – for every repenting, careful person.
Who fears the Most Gracious without seeing, and came with a heart that inclines.
It will be said to him, “Enter it in peace; this is the day of eternity.”
In it for them is all that they may desire, and with Us is more than it.
And many a generation We did destroy before them, who exceeded them in strength, therefore venturing in the cities!
Is there a place to escape?
Indeed in this is an advice for anyone who keeps a heart, or listens attentively.
And We have indeed created the heavens and the earth, and all what is between them, in six days; and fatigue did not even approach Us.
Therefore (O dear prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) patiently bear upon what they say, and praising your Lord say His Purity before the sun rises and before the sun sets.
And say His Purity during the night, and after the customary prayers.
And listen attentively on the day when an announcer will proclaim from a place nearby.
The day when all will hear the Scream with the truth; this is the day of coming out of the graves.
Indeed it is We Who give life, and give death, and towards Us only is the return.
On the day when the earth will split for them, so they will come out in haste; this is the gathering – easy for Us.
We well know what they say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), and you are not one to use force over them; therefore advise him with the Qur’an, whoever fears My threat.
By oath of those which carry away while dispersing.
Then by oath of those which carry the burdens.
Then by oath of those which move with ease.
Then by oath of those which distribute by the command.
Undoubtedly, the promise you are given is surely true.
And undoubtedly justice will surely be done.
And by oath of the decorated heaven.
You are indeed in different opinions regarding this Qur’an.
Only those who are destined to revert, are reverted from it.
Slain be those who mould from their imaginations.
Those who have forgotten in a state of intoxication.
They ask, “When will be the Day of Judgement?”
It will be on the day when they will be roasted in the fire.
And it will be said to them, “Taste your own roasting; this is what you were impatient for.”
Indeed the pious are among Gardens and water springs.
Accepting the rewards given by their Lord; they were indeed virtuous before this.
They used to sleep only a little during the night.
And used to seek forgiveness before dawn.
And the beggar and the destitute had a share in their wealth.
And in the earth are signs for those who are certain.
And in your own selves; so can you not perceive?
And in the heaven lies your sustenance, and the promise you are given.
So by oath of the Lord of the heavens and the earth, this Qur’an is the Truth, in the same language that you speak.
Did the news of Ibrahim’s honourable guests reach you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him)?
When they came to him and said, “Peace”; he answered, “Peace”; and thought, “These people are not familiar.”
Then he went to his home – so he brought a healthy calf.
He then presented it before them and said, “Do you not eat?”
He therefore inwardly sensed fear of them; they said, “Do not fear!”; and they gave him the glad tidings of a knowledgeable son.
So his wife came screaming, and striking her forehead cried, “What! For a barren old woman?”
They said, “This is how your Lord has decreed; indeed He only is the Wise, the All Knowing.”
Said Ibrahim, “What is your task, O the sent angels?”
They said, “We have been sent towards a guilty nation.”
“To throw upon them stones of baked clay.”
“That are kept marked, with your Lord, for the transgressors.”
So We removed the people who had faith, from that town.
We therefore found just one house over there that was Muslim.
And We kept a sign remaining in it, for those who fear the painful punishment.
And in Moosa, when We sent him with a clear proof towards Firaun.
In response, he turned away along with his army and said, “He is a magician or a madman.”
We therefore seized him and his army and threw them into the sea, while he was blaming himself.
And in the tribe of A’ad, when we sent a dry windstorm upon them.
It left out nothing in its path, but which it split up into fragments.
And in the tribe of Thamud when it was told to them, “Enjoy for a while.”
In response they rebelled against their Lord’s command, so the thunderbolt seized them whilst they were watching.
So they were neither able to stand up, nor were they able to take revenge.
And before them, We destroyed the people of Nooh; they were indeed a sinning nation.
And We have built the heaven with hands (the Divine Power), and it is We Who give the expanse.
And We made the earth a base, so how well do We lay out!
And We created all things in pairs, so that you may ponder.
“Therefore rush towards Allah; indeed I am from Him, a clear Herald of Warning towards you.”
“And do not appoint other deities along with Allah; indeed I am from Him, a clear Herald of Warning towards you.”
Similarly, whenever a Noble Messenger came to those before them they always said, “He is a magician or a madman.”
What! Have they willed this utterance to one another?
In fact they are a rebellious people.
Therefore turn away from them (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), – so there is no blame upon you.
And advise, for advice benefits the Muslims.
And I created the jinns and men, only for them to worship Me.
I do not ask any sustenance from them, nor wish that they give Me food.
Indeed it is Allah, Who is the Greatest Sustainer, the Strong, the Able.
And indeed for these unjust is also a turn of punishment, like that of their companions – so they must not ask Me to hasten.
So ruin is for disbelievers, from their day – which they are promised.
By oath of (mount) Tur.
And by oath of a passage, written –
On an open record.
And by oath of the Inhabited House.
And the lofty roof.
And the sea set aflame.
Indeed your Lord’s punishment will surely take place.
No one can avert it.
A day on which the heavens will shake with a visible shaking.
And the mountains will move with a visible movement.
So on that day, ruin is for those who deny.
Those who are playing in pursuits.
A day when they will be pushed, forcibly shoved towards the fire of hell.
“This is the fire, which you used to deny!”
“So is this magic, or are you unable to see?”
“Enter it – now whether you patiently bear it or are impatient – it is the same for you; for you is a recompense only for what you used to do.”
Indeed the pious are in Gardens and peace.
Delighted at the bestowal of their Lord; and their Lord has saved them from the fire.
“Eat and drink with pleasure, a reward for what you used to do.”
Reclining on thrones, in rows; and We have wedded them to maidens with gorgeous eyes.
And those who accepted faith, and whose descendants followed them with faith – We have joined their descendants with them, and have not reduced anything for them from their deeds; every soul is trapped in its own deeds.
And We aided them with fruit and meat, whatever they desire.
In it, they accept cups from each other, in which is neither any lewdness nor any sin.
And their boy servants shall go around them, as if they were pearls, safely hidden.
And one of them turned towards the other, questioning.
Saying, “Indeed before this, we were in our houses, worried.”
“So Allah did us a great favour, and saved us from the punishment of the flame.”
“Indeed we used to worship Him in our previous life; indeed He only is the Benign, the Most Merciful.”
Therefore (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), enlighten, for by the munificence of your Lord, you are neither a soothsayer nor a madman.
Or they allege, “He is a poet – we await a calamity of the times to befall him.”
Proclaim, “Go on waiting – I too am waiting along with you.”
Is this what their senses tell them, or are they a rebellious people?
What! They say, “He has invented the Qur'an”?
Rather they do not have faith.
So let them bring a single discourse like it, if they are truthful.
Have they not been created from some source, or are they themselves the creators?
Or did they create the heavens and the earth?
Rather they are not certain.
Or do they have the treasures of your Lord, or are they the authority?
Or do they have any stairs, climbing upon which they eavesdrop?
So their eavesdropper should bring some clear proof!
What! The daughters for Him, and the sons for you?
Or do you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) ask any fee from them, so they are burdened with the penalty?
Or is the hidden with them, by which they pass judgements?
Or are they planning a conspiracy?
So the conspiracy will befall only upon the disbelievers.
Or do they have a God besides Allah?
Purity is to Allah from their ascribing of partners to Him.
And were they to see a portion of the sky falling, they will say, “It is a heap of clouds.”
Therefore leave them, until they confront their day, in which they will be stunned.
A day on which their scheming will not benefit them at all, nor will they be helped.
And indeed for the unjust is another punishment before this, but most of them do not know. (Punishment in the grave is proven by this verse.)
And be patient upon your Lord’s command, (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), for you are indeed in Our sight; and proclaim the Purity of your Lord while praising Him, whenever you stand.
And proclaim His Purity during the night, and when the stars turn back.
By oath of the beloved shining star Mohammed (peace and blessings be upon him), when he returned from the Ascent.
Your companion did not err, nor did he go astray.
And he does not say anything by his own desire.
It is but a divine revelation, which is revealed to him.
He has been taught by the Extremely Powerful.
The Strong; then the Spectacle inclined towards him.
And he was on the horizon of the highest heaven.
Then the Spectacle became closer, and came down in full view.
So the distance between the Spectacle and the beloved was only two arms’ length, or even less. (The Heavenly Journey of Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him – was with body and soul.)
So Allah divinely revealed to His bondman, whatever He divinely revealed.
The heart did not deny, what it saw. (The Holy Prophet was bestowed with seeing Allah – see also preceding verses 8, 9, 10.)
What! So do you dispute with him regarding what he saw?
And indeed he did see the Spectacle again.
Near the lote-tree of the last boundary.
Close to which is the Everlasting Paradise.
When the lote-tree was being enveloped, by whatever around it.
The sight did not shift, nor did it cross the limits.
Indeed he saw the supreme signs of his Lord.
So did you observe the idols Lat and Uzza?
And subsequently the third, the Manat?
What!
For you the son, and for Him the daughter?
Then that is surely a very unjust distribution!
They are nothing but some names that you have coined, you and your forefathers – Allah has not sent any proof for them; they follow only guesses and their own desires; whereas the guidance from their Lord has come to them.
What! Will man get whatever he dreams of?
So (know that) Allah only is the Owner of all – the Hereafter and this world.
And many an angel is in the heavens, whose intercession does not benefit the least unless Allah gives permission for whomever He wills, and whom He likes.
Indeed those who do not believe in the Hereafter, coin the names of angels like those of females.
And they do not have any knowledge of it; they just follow assumption; and indeed assumption does not serve any purpose in place of the Truth.
Therefore turn away from whoever has turned away from Our remembrance and has desired only the life of this world.
This is the extent of their knowledge; indeed your Lord well knows one who has strayed from His path, and He well knows one who has attained guidance.
And to Allah only belongs all whatever is in the heavens and all whatever is in the earth, in order to repay those who do evil for what they have done, and give an excellent reward to those who do good.
Those who avoid the cardinal sins and lewdness, except that they approached it and refrained; indeed your Lord’s mercy is limitless; He knows you very well – since He has created you from clay, and when you were foetuses in your mothers’ wombs; therefore do not, on your own, claim yourselves to be clean; He well knows who are the pious.
So did you observe him who turned away?
And he gave a little, then refrained?
Does he have knowledge of the hidden, so he can foresee?
Did not the news reach him, of that which is mentioned in the Books of Moosa?
And of Ibrahim, who was most obedient?
That no burdened soul bears another soul’s burden?
And that man will not obtain anything except what he strove for?
And that his effort will soon be scrutinised?
Then he will be fully repaid for it?
And that the end is only towards your Lord?
And that it is He Who made (you) laugh and made (you) cry?
And that it is He Who gave death and gave life?
And that it is He Who has created the two pairs, male and female?
From a drop of liquid, when it is added?
And that only upon Him is the next revival?
And that it is He Who has given wealth and contentment?
And that He only is the Lord of the star Sirius?
And that it is He Who earlier destroyed the tribe of Aad?
And destroyed the tribe of Thamud, not sparing anyone?
And before them, the people of Nooh? Indeed they were more unjust and more rebellious than these!
And that it is He Who threw down the upturned townships?
So they were covered with whatever covered them?
So O listener! Which favour of your Lord will you doubt?
He (Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) is a Herald of Warning, like the former Heralds of Warning.
The approaching event has come near.
None except Allah can avert it.
So are you surprised at this fact?
And you laugh, and do not weep!
And you are lost in play!
Therefore prostrate for Allah, and worship Him. (Command of Prostration # 12)
The Last Day came near, and the moon split apart.
And when they see a sign, they turn away and say, “Just a customary magic!”
And they denied and followed their own desires, whereas each matter has been decided!
And indeed the news which had a lot of deterrence, came to them.
The pinnacle of wisdom – so how will the Heralds of warning provide any benefit?
Therefore turn away from them; on the day when the announcer will call towards a severe unknown matter –
They will come out from the graves with eyes lowered, as if they were spread locusts.
Rushing towards the caller; the disbelievers will say, “This is a tough day.”
Before these, the people of Nooh denied and they belied Our bondman and said, “He is a madman” and rebuffed him.
He therefore prayed to his Lord, “I am overpowered, therefore avenge me.”
We therefore opened the gates of heaven, with water flowing furiously.
And caused springs to gush out from the earth, so that the two waters met totalling a quantity that had been destined.
And We carried Nooh upon a ship of wooden planks and nails.
Sailing in front of Our sight; as a reward for the sake of one who was rejected.
And We left it as a sign – so is there one who would ponder?
So how did My punishment turn out, and My threats?
And We have indeed made the Qur’an easy to memorise, so is there one who would remember?
The tribe of A’ad denied – so how did My punishment turn out, and My warnings?
We indeed sent towards them a severe windstorm, on a day the ill luck of which lasted upon them forever.
Smashing down men as if they were uprooted trunks of date palms.
So how did My punishment turn out, and My warnings?
And We have indeed made the Qur’an easy to memorise, so is there one who would remember?
The tribe of Thamud denied the Noble Messengers.
So they said, “What!
Shall we follow a man from among us?
If we do, we are indeed astray, and insane!”
“What! Of all the men among us, the remembrance has come down upon him?
In fact, he is a mischievous, great liar.”
It was said to Saleh, “They will soon realise tomorrow who is the mischievous great liar.”
“We shall send a she-camel to test them, therefore O Saleh, wait and have patience.”
“And inform them that the water is to be shared between them; only those may come whose turn it is.”
In response they called their companion – he therefore caught and hamstrung the she-camel.
So how did My punishment turn out, and My warnings?
Indeed We sent upon them a single Scream – thereupon they became like the barrier builder’s residual dry trampled hay.
And We have indeed made the Qur’an easy to memorise, so is there one who would remember?
The people of Lut denied the Noble Messengers.
Indeed We sent a shower of stones upon them, except the family of Lut; We rescued them before dawn.
As a reward from Us; this is how We reward one who gives thanks.
And indeed he had warned them of Our seizure – in response they doubted the warnings.
And they tried to persuade him regarding his guests – We therefore blinded their eyes, “So taste My punishment, and My warnings.”
And indeed, the everlasting punishment overcame them early in the morning.
“So taste My punishment, and My warnings!”
And We have indeed made the Qur’an easy to memorise, so is there one who would remember?
And indeed the Noble Messengers came to the people of Firaun.
They denied all Our signs, We therefore seized them – the seizure of the Most Honourable, the All Powerful.
Are your disbelievers better than they were, or have you been given exemption in the Books?
Or they say, “We shall all take revenge as a group.”
The group will soon be routed, and will turn their backs to flee.
In fact their promise is upon the Last Day – and the Last Day is very severe and very bitter!
Indeed the criminals are astray and insane.
On the day when they are dragged upon their faces in the fire – “Taste the heat of hell.”
We have indeed created all things by a proper measure.
And Our command is only a fleeting one – like the batting of an eyelid.
And We have indeed destroyed your kind, so is there one who would ponder?
And all what they did is in the Books.
And every small and great thing is recorded.
Indeed the pious are amidst Gardens and springs.
Seated in an assembly of the Truth, in the presence of Allah, the Omnipotent King.
Allah, the Most Gracious
Has taught the Qur’an to His beloved Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him).
Has created Prophet Mohammed (peace and blessings be upon him) as the soul of mankind.
Has taught him the knowledge of the past and the future.
The sun and the moon are scheduled.
And the plants and the trees prostrate (for Him).
And Allah has raised the sky; and He has set the balance.
In order that you may not corrupt the balance.
And establish the measures justly, nor decrease the due weight.
And He appointed the earth for the creatures.
In which are fruits, and covered dates.
And grain covered with husk, and fragrant flowers.
So O men and jinns! Which favour of your Lord will you deny?
He created man from clay like that of earthenware.
And created jinn from the flame of fire.
So O men and jinns! Which favour of your Lord will you deny?
Lord of both the Easts, and Lord of both the Wests!
So O men and jinns! Which favour of your Lord will you deny?
He has set flowing two seas that appear to meet.
Whereas there is a barrier between them so they cannot encroach upon one another.
So O men and jinns! Which favour of your Lord will you deny?
Pearls and coral-stone come forth from them.
So O men and jinns! Which favour of your Lord will you deny?
To Him only belong the sailing ships, raised above the sea like hills.
So O men and jinns! Which favour of your Lord will you deny?
For everything on the earth is extinction.
And everlasting is the Entity of your Lord, the Most Majestic and the Most Honourable.
So O men and jinns! Which favour of your Lord will you deny?
All those who are in the heavens and the earth seek only from Him; every day is an enterprise for Him.
So O men and jinns! Which favour of your Lord will you deny?
Disposing all works quickly We tend towards your account, O you two large groups!
So O men and jinns! Which favour of your Lord will you deny?
O the groups of jinns and men, if you can cross the boundaries of the heavens and the earth, then cross them; wherever you may go, His is the kingdom!
So O men and jinns! Which favour of your Lord will you deny?
Flames of smokeless fire and black smoke without flames, will be let loose on you, so you will not be able to retaliate.
So O men and jinns! Which favour of your Lord will you deny?
And when the heaven will split, it will appear like a rose painted red.
So O men and jinns! Which favour of your Lord will you deny?
On that day no sinner will be questioned about his sins, from men or from jinns.
So O men and jinns! Which favour of your Lord will you deny?
The criminals will be recognised from their faces, so will be caught by their forelocks and feet, and thrown into hell.
So O men and jinns! Which favour of your Lord will you deny?
This is hell, which the criminals deny.
They shall keep going back and forth between it and the extremely hot boiling water.
So O men and jinns! Which favour of your Lord will you deny?
And for one who fears to stand before his Lord, are two Gardens.
So O men and jinns! Which favour of your Lord will you deny?
Having numerous branches.
So O men and jinns! Which favour of your Lord will you deny?
In the two Gardens flow two springs.
So O men and jinns! Which favour of your Lord will you deny?
In which are fruits of all kinds, each of two varieties.
So O men and jinns! Which favour of your Lord will you deny?
Reclining upon thrones that are lined with brocade, with the fruit of both Gardens close enough to be picked from under.
So O men and jinns! Which favour of your Lord will you deny?
Upon thrones are the women who do not gaze at men except their husbands, and before them, are untouched by any man or jinn.
So O men and jinns! Which favour of your Lord will you deny?
They are like rubies and coral-stone.
So O men and jinns! Which favour of your Lord will you deny?
What is the reward of virtue except virtue (in return)?
So O men and jinns! Which favour of your Lord will you deny?
And besides them, there are two more Gardens.
So O men and jinns! Which favour of your Lord will you deny?
Densely covered with foliage, appearing dark.
So O men and jinns! Which favour of your Lord will you deny?
In the Gardens are two springs, overflowing with abundance.
So O men and jinns! Which favour of your Lord will you deny?
In them are fruits (of all kinds), and dates and pomegranate.
So O men and jinns! Which favour of your Lord will you deny?
In them are women of good behaviour and gorgeous faces.
So O men and jinns! Which favour of your Lord will you deny?
They are houris (maidens of Paradise), hidden from view, in pavilions.
So O men and jinns! Which favour of your Lord will you deny?
Untouched by any man or jinn, before them.
So O men and jinns! Which favour of your Lord will you deny?
Reclining on green cushions and beautiful decorated carpets.
So O men and jinns! Which favour of your Lord will you deny?
Most Auspicious is the name of your Lord, the Most Majestic and the Most Honourable.
When the forthcoming event does occur.
Then none will be able to deny its occurrence.
The event will be abasing some, and exalting some.
When the earth will tremble, shivering.
And the mountains will be crushed, blown to bits.
So they will become like fine dust, scattered in a shaft of light.
And you will become divided into three categories.
So those on the right – how (fortunate) are those on the right!
And those on the left – how (wretched) are those on the left!
And those who surpassed have indeed excelled.
It is they who are the close ones.
They are in Gardens of peace.
A large group from the earlier generations.
And a few from the latter.
On studded thrones.
Reclining on them, facing each other.
Surrounded by immortal boys.
Carrying bowls and pitchers – and cups filled with wine flowing before them.
Their heads shall not ache with it, nor shall they lose their senses.
And fruits that they may like.
And meat of birds that they may wish.
And gorgeous eyed fair maidens.
Like pearls safely hidden.
The reward for what they did.
They will not hear any useless speech in it, or any sin.
Except the saying, “Peace, peace.”
And those on the right – how (fortunate) are those on the right!
Among thorn-less lote-trees.
And clusters of banana plants.
And in everlasting shade.
And in perpetually flowing water.
And plenty of fruits.
That will neither finish, nor ever be stopped.
And raised couches.
We have indeed developed these women with an excellent development.
So made them as maidens.
The beloved of their husbands, of one age.
For those on the right.
A large group from the earlier generations.
And a large group from the latter.
And those on the left – how (wretched) are those on the left!
In scorching wind and boiling hot water.
And in the shadow of a burning smoke.
Which is neither cool nor is for respect.
Indeed they were among favours before this.
And were stubborn upon the great sin (of disbelief).
And they used to say, “When we are dead and have turned into dust and bones, will we surely be raised again?”
“And also our forefathers?”
Proclaim, “Without doubt all – the former and the latter.”
“They will all be gathered together – on the appointed time of the known day.”
Then indeed you, the astray, the deniers –
You will indeed eat from the Zaqqum tree.
Then will fill your bellies with it.
And upon it, you will drink the hot boiling water.
Drinking the way thirsty camels drink.
This is their reception on the Day of Justice.
It is We Who created you, so why do you not accept the truth?
So what is your opinion regarding the semen you discharge?
Do you make a human out of it, or is it We Who create?
It is We Who have ordained death among you, and We have not been beaten –
In the matter of exchanging you for others, and to transform you into what you do not know.
And you have indeed learnt about the first creation, so why do you not ponder?
So what is your opinion regarding what you sow?
Is it you who cultivate it, or is it We Who develop it?
If We will We can make it like dry trampled hay, so you would keep crying out.
That, “We have indeed been penalised!”
“In fact, we were unfortunate!”
So what is your opinion regarding the water that you drink?
Is it you who caused it to descend from the cloud, or is it We Who cause it to descend?
If We will We can make it bitter, so why do you not give thanks?
So what is your opinion regarding the fire which you kindle?
Is it you who grew its tree, or is it We Who create?
We have made it as a reminder of hell and as a utility for travellers in the jungle.
Therefore (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) proclaim the Purity of the name of your Lord, the Greatest.
So I swear by the setting places of the stars.
And that is indeed a tremendous oath, if you understand.
This is indeed the noble Qur’an.
Kept in a secure Book.
None may touch it, except with ablution.
Sent down by the Lord Of The Creation.
So is this the matter regarding which you laze?
And you make its denial your share?
So why was it not, when the soul reaches up to the throat, –
Whereas you watch at that moment!
And We are nearer to him than you are, but you cannot see.
So why is it not, that if you are not to be repaid, –
That you bring it back, if you are truthful?
Then if the dying one is of those having proximity, –
Then is relief, and flowers – and Gardens of peace.
And if he is of those on the right, –
Then upon you is the greetings of peace (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), from those on the right.
And if he is from the deniers, the astray, –
Then his reception is the hot boiling water.
And a hurling into the blazing fire.
This is indeed an utmost certainty.
Therefore (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) proclaim the Purity of the name of your Lord, the Greatest.
All whatever is in the heavens and in the earth proclaims the Purity of Allah; and He only is the Most Honourable, the Wise.
For Him only is the kingship of the heavens and the earth; He gives life and causes death; and He is Able to do all things.
He only is the First and He only the Last, and He only is the Evident and He only the Concealed; and it is He Who knows all things.
It is He Who created the heavens and the earth in six days, then ascended the Throne (of Control), in a manner befitting His Majesty; He knows all what goes into the earth and all what comes out of it, and all what descends from the sky and all that rises in it; and He is with you, wherever you may be; and Allah is seeing your deeds.
For Him only is the kingship of the heavens and the earth; and towards Allah only is the return of all matters.
He brings the night in a part of the day, and brings the day in a part of the night; and He knows what lies within the hearts.
Accept faith in Allah and His Noble Messenger, and spend in His cause from what He has made you the heirs of; so for those among you who accepted faith and spent in His cause, is a great reward.
And what is the matter with you, that you should not accept faith in Allah? Whereas this Noble Messenger is calling you to believe in your Lord, and Allah has indeed already taken a covenant from you, if you believe.
It is He Who sends down clear verses upon His chosen bondman, in order to take you out from the realms of darkness towards light; and indeed Allah is Most Compassionate, Most Merciful upon you.
And what is the matter with you that you should not spend in Allah’s cause, whereas Allah is the Inheritor of all that is in the heavens and in the earth? Those among you who spent and fought before the conquest of Mecca are not equal to others; they are greater in rank than those who spent and fought after the conquest; and Allah has promised Paradise to all of them; and Allah well knows what you do.
Who will lend a handsome loan to Allah so that He may double it for him?
And for such is an honourable reward.
The day when you will see the believing men and believing women, that their light runs before them and on their right – it being said to them, “This day, the best tidings for you are the Gardens beneath which rivers flow – abide in it forever; this is the greatest success.”
The day when hypocrite men and hypocrite women will say to the Muslims, “Look mercifully towards us, so that we may gain some of your light!”; it will be said to them, “Turn back, search light over there!”; so they will turn around, whereupon a wall will be erected between them, in which is a gate; inside the gate is mercy, and on the outer side is the punishment.
The hypocrites will call out to the Muslims, “Were we not with you?”; they will answer, “Yes you were, why not?
But you had put your souls into trial, and you used to await misfortune for the Muslims, and you doubted, and false hopes deceived you until Allah’s command came – and the big cheat had made you conceited towards the command of Allah.”
“So this day no ransom is to be taken from you nor from the declared disbelievers; your destination is the fire; that is your companion; and what a wretched outcome!”
Has not the time come for the believers to surrender their hearts to Allah’s remembrance and to this truth that has come down? And do not be like those who were earlier given the Book(s) and when a long term passed over them, their hearts became hardened; and many of them are sinners.
Know that it is Allah Who revives the earth after its death; We have indeed illustrated the signs for you, for you to understand.
Indeed the charity-giving men and women, and those who lend an excellent loan to Allah – for them is double, and for them is an honourable reward.
And those who believe in Allah and all His Noble Messengers, are the truly sincere; and are witness upon others, before their Lord; for them is their reward, and their light; and those who disbelieved and denied Our signs, are the people of hell.
Know that the life of this world is nothing but play and pastime, and adornment, and boasting amongst yourselves, and the desire to surpass each other in wealth and children; like the rain the produce of which pleased the farmer, then dried so you see it yellow, and then turned into dry trampled hay; and in the Hereafter is a severe punishment, and the forgiveness from Allah and His pleasure; and the life of this world is nothing but counterfeit wealth.
Rush towards the forgiveness of your Lord and a Paradise wide as the expanse of the heavens and the earth – made for those who believe in Allah and all His Noble Messengers; this is Allah’s munificence, He may bestow it to whomever He wills; and Allah is Extremely Munificent.
There is no misfortune that reaches in the earth or in your selves but is mentioned in a Book, before We initiate it; indeed this is easy for Allah.
So that you may not be saddened upon losing something, nor rejoice upon what you are given; and Allah does not like any boastful, conceited person.
Those who practice miserliness, and exhort others to miserliness; and whoever turns away, then (know that) Allah is the Independent, the Most Praiseworthy.
Indeed We sent Our Noble Messengers with proofs, and sent down the Book and the Balance of Justice along with them, so that people may stay upon justice; and We sent down iron having severe heat and benefits for mankind, and so that Allah may see him, who without seeing aides Him and His Noble Messengers; indeed Allah is Almighty, Dominant.
And indeed We sent Nooh and Ibrahim, and placed Prophethood and the Book among their descendants, so some among them took to guidance; and many of them are sinners.
We then sent Our other Noble Messengers after them following their footsteps, and after them We sent Eisa, the son of Maryam, and bestowed the Injeel to him; and We instilled compassion and mercy in the hearts of his followers; and they invented monasticism which We had not ordained upon them only to seek Allah’s pleasure, then did not properly abide by it as it should have been rightfully abided; We therefore gave the believers among them their reward; and many of them are sinners.
O People who Believe (in the earlier Noble Messengers)!
Fear Allah and accept faith in this Noble Messenger of His – He will bestow two portions of His mercy to you and will create a light for you to walk in it, and will forgive you; and Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
This is so that the disbelievers among People given the Book(s) may know that they do not have any control over Allah’s munificence, and that the munificence is in Allah’s Hand (control) – He bestows to whomever He wills; and Allah is Extremely Munificent.
Allah has indeed heard the speech of the woman who is arguing with you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) concerning her husband, and is complaining to Allah; and Allah hears the conversation of you both; indeed Allah is All Hearing, All Knowing.
Those among you who have proclaimed their wives as their mothers – so their wives are not their mothers; their mothers are only those that gave them birth; and undoubtedly they utter evil and a blatant lie; and indeed Allah is Most Pardoning, Oft Forgiving.
And those among you who have proclaimed their wives as their mothers and then wish to revert to the matter upon which they had uttered such an enormous word, must then free a slave before they touch one another; this is what you are advised; and Allah is Aware of your deeds.
So one who cannot find a slave, must then fast for two successive months before they touch one another; and one who cannot even fast, must then feed sixty needy ones; this is in order that you keep faith in Allah and His Noble Messenger; and these are the limits of Allah; and for the disbelievers is a painful punishment.
Indeed those who oppose Allah and His Noble Messenger have been humiliated, like those before them who were humiliated, and We have indeed sent down clear verses; and for the disbelievers is a disgraceful punishment.
The day when Allah will raise all of them together and inform them of their misdeeds; Allah has kept count of them, whereas they have forgotten them; and all things are present before Allah.
O listener! Did you not see that Allah knows all whatever is in the heavens and all whatever is in the earth?
Wherever there is any discussion among three He is the fourth present with them, and among five He is the sixth, and there is no discussion among fewer or more except that He is with them wherever they may be; and then on the Day of Resurrection He will inform them of all what they did; indeed Allah knows all things.
Did you not see those who were forbidden from conspiracy, yet they do what was forbidden, and consult each other for sinning, and for exceeding limits, and for disobeying the Noble Messenger?
And when they come in your presence, they greet you with words not chosen by Allah for respectfully greeting you, and they inwardly say, “Why does not Allah punish us for what we say?”; hell is sufficient for them; they will sink into it; and what a wretched outcome!
O People who Believe! When you consult each other, do not consult for sinning, nor for exceeding limits, nor for disobeying the Noble Messenger – and consult for righteousness and piety; and fear Allah, towards Whom you will be raised.
The evil consultation is only from the devil in order that he may upset the believers, whereas he cannot harm them in the least without Allah’s command; and only upon Allah must the Muslims rely.
O People who Believe! When you are told to give room in the assemblies, then do give room – Allah will give you room (in His mercy); and when it is said, “Stand up in reverence”, then do stand up – Allah will raise the believers among you, and those given knowledge, to high ranks; and Allah is Aware of your deeds.
O People who Believe!
When you wish to humbly consult with the Noble Messenger, give some charity before you consult; that is much better and much purer for you; so if you do not have the means, then (know that) Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
Were you afraid to offer charity before you consult?
So when you did not do this, and Allah has inclined towards you with His mercy, keep the prayers established and pay the obligatory charity and obey Allah and His Noble Messenger; and Allah is Aware of your deeds.
Did you not see those who befriended those upon whom is Allah’s wrath?
They are neither of you nor of these – and they swear a false oath, whereas they know.
Allah has kept prepared a severe punishment for them; indeed they commit extremely evil deeds.
They use their oaths as a shield therefore preventing from Allah’s way – so for them is a disgraceful punishment.
Their wealth and their children will be of no use to them before Allah; they are the people of hell; they are to remain in it forever.
The day when Allah will raise them all, they will swear in His presence the way they now swear in front of you, and they will assume that they have achieved something; pay heed!
Indeed it is they who are the liars.
The devil has overpowered them, so they forgot the remembrance of Allah; they are the devil’s group; pay heed!
Indeed it is the devil’s group who are the losers.
Indeed those who oppose Allah and His Noble Messenger, are among the most despicable.
Allah has already decreed that, “I will indeed be victorious, and My Noble Messengers”; indeed Allah is Almighty, the Most Honourable.
You will not find the people who believe in Allah and the Last Day, befriending those who oppose Allah and His Noble Messenger, even if they are their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their tribesmen; it is these upon whose hearts Allah has ingrained faith, and has aided them with a Spirit from Himself; and He will admit them into Gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding in them forever; Allah is pleased with them, and they are pleased with Him; this is Allah’s group; pay heed! Indeed it is Allah’s group who are the successful.
All whatever is in the heavens and all whatever is in the earth proclaims the Purity of Allah; and He only is the Most Honourable, the Wise.
It is He Who expelled the disbelievers among the People given the Book(s) from their homes, for their first gathering; you did not expect them to leave, whereas they assumed that their fortresses would save them from Allah, so Allah’s command came to them from a place they had not imagined; and He instilled awe in their hearts, so they ruin their own houses by their own hands and at the hands of the Muslims; therefore learn a lesson, O those who can perceive!
And had Allah not decreed exile for them, He would have surely punished them in this world; and for them in the Hereafter is the punishment of the fire.
This is because they remained opposed to Allah and His Noble Messenger; and whoever remains opposed to Allah, (and His Noble Messenger) – then indeed Allah’s punishment is severe.
The trees you had cut down or left standing on their roots was all by Allah’s permission, and in order to disgrace the sinners.
And from them, the booty which Allah gave to His Noble Messenger – so you had not raced your horses or camels against them, but it is Allah Who gives whomever He wills within the control of His Noble Messengers; and Allah is Able to do all things.
The booty which Allah gave to His Noble Messenger from the people of the townships, is for Allah and His Noble Messenger, and for the relatives, and the orphans, and the needy and the travellers – so that it does not become the wealth of the rich among you; and accept whatever the Noble Messenger gives you; and refrain from whatever he forbids you; and fear Allah; indeed Allah’s punishment is severe.
And (the booty is) also for the poor migrants who were expelled from their homes and their wealth, seeking Allah’s munificence and His pleasure, and aiding Allah and His Noble Messenger; it is they who are the truthful.
And those who accepted this city as their home and accepted faith before them, befriend those who migrated towards them, and in their breasts do not find any need for what they have been given, and prefer the migrants above themselves even if they themselves are in dire need; and whoever is saved from the greed of his soul – it is they who are the successful.
And those who came after them say, “O our Lord! Forgive us, and our brothers who accepted faith before us, and do not keep any malice in our hearts towards the believers – O our Lord!
Indeed You only are the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.”.
Did you not see the hypocrites, that they say to their disbelieving brothers among the People given the Book(s), “If you are expelled, then we will definitely go out with you, and we will not listen to anyone in your matters, and if you are fought against we will surely help you”; and Allah testifies that they are indeed liars.
If they are expelled, the hypocrites will not go out with them; and if they are fought against they will not help them; and even if they were to help them, they would turn their backs and flee; and then they will not be helped.
Indeed in their hearts is a greater fear of you than that of Allah; this is because they are a people who do not understand.
They will not fight you even if they all come together, except in barricaded cities or from behind walls; they are severe fighters among themselves; you will assume them to be one, whereas their hearts are divided; this is because they are a people who do not have any sense.
Like the example of those who were before them not long ago – they tasted the evil result of their deeds; and for them is a painful punishment.
The example of the devil – when he said to man “Disbelieve”; so when he has rejected faith, he says, “I am unconcerned with you – indeed I fear Allah, the Lord of The Creation.”
So the fate of them both is that they are both in the fire, to remain in it forever; and this is the proper punishment for the unjust.
O People who Believe! Fear Allah, and every soul must see what it has sent ahead for tomorrow; and fear Allah; indeed Allah is Aware of your deeds.
And do not be like those who forgot Allah – He therefore put them into hardship making them forget themselves; it is they who are the sinners.
The People of hell and the People of Paradise are not equal; it is only the People of Paradise who have succeeded.
Had We sent down this Qur’an upon a mountain, you would have then surely seen it bowed down, blown to bits by the fear of Allah; and We illustrate such examples for people, for them to ponder.
It is Allah, except Whom there is no God; the Knowing of all – the hidden and the evident; He only is the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
It is Allah, except Whom there is no God; the King, the Pure, the Giver of Peace, the Bestower of Safety, the Protector, the Most Honourable, the Compeller, the Proud; Purity is to Allah from all what they ascribe as partners (to Him)!
It is Allah only, Who is the Creator, the Initiator, the Designer of all – His only are all the good names; all whatever is in the heavens and in the earth proclaims His Purity; and He only is the Most Honourable, the Wise.
O People who Believe! Do not befriend My and your enemy – you reveal secrets to them out of friendship whereas they disbelieve in the truth which has come to you!
It is they who remove the Noble Messenger and you from your homes, upon your believing in Allah, your Lord; if you have come out to fight for My cause, and to gain My pleasure, then do not befriend them; you send them secret messages of friendship – and I well know all what you hide and all what you disclose; and whoever among you does it, has indeed strayed away from the right path.
If they gain dominance over you they will be your enemies, and will extend their hands and their tongues towards you with evil, and they wish that in some way you turn disbelievers.
Neither your relations nor your offspring will in the least benefit you, on the Day of Resurrection; He will separate you from them; and Allah is seeing your deeds.
Indeed in Ibrahim, and those along with him, lay a good example for you follow – when they said to their people, “Indeed we are unconcerned with you and all what you worship besides Allah; we reject you, and between us and you has surfaced enmity and hatred for ever until you accept faith in the One Allah” – except the saying of Ibrahim to his father, “I will surely seek forgiveness for you, and I do not possess any power to benefit you against Allah”; “O our Lord!
We have relied only upon You, and towards You only we have inclined and only towards You is the return”.
Do not put us into the trial of the disbelievers, and forgive us, O our Lord! Indeed You only are the Most Honourable, the Wise.”
Indeed in them lay a good example for you to follow – for one who looks forward to (meeting) Allah and the Last Day; and whoever turns away – then (know that) indeed Allah only is the Independent, the Most Praiseworthy.
It is likely that Allah may create friendship between you and those among them who are now your enemies; and Allah is All Able; and Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
Allah does not forbid you from those who did not fight against you because of religion and did not drive you out from your homes, that you should be kind towards them and deal with them fairly; indeed the equitable are the beloved of Allah.
Allah forbids you only from those who fought against you because of religion or drove you out from your homes or helped others to drive you out, that you should befriend them; and whoever befriends them – it is they who are the unjust.
O People who Believe! When Muslim women leave the lands of disbelief and migrate towards you, examine them; Allah knows more about their faith; so if you judge the women to be believers, do not send them back to the disbelievers; neither are they lawful for the disbelievers, nor are the disbelievers lawful for them; and give their disbelieving husbands what they had spent; and there is no sin upon you to marry them if you give them their bridal money; and do not continue the marriage with disbelieving women – and ask for what you had spent, and the disbelievers may ask for what they had spent; this is Allah’s command; He judges between you; and Allah is All Knowing, Wise.
And if some women go away from the Muslims to the disbelievers – then when you punish the disbelievers, give from the war booty to the Muslims who lost their wives the amount they had spent; and fear Allah in Whom you believe.
O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him)!
If Muslim women come humbly to you to take oath of allegiance that they will neither ascribe any partner to Allah, nor steal, nor commit adultery, nor kill their children, nor bring the lie that they carry between their hands and feet, nor disobey you in any rightful matter – then accept their allegiance and seek forgiveness from Allah for them; indeed Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
O People who Believe! Do not befriend the people upon whom is Allah’s wrath – they have lost hope in the Hereafter the way the disbelievers have lost hope in the people of the graves.
All whatever is in the heavens and all whatever is in the earth proclaims the Purity of Allah; and He only is the Most Honourable, the Wise.
O People who Believe! Why do you preach what you do not practice?
How despicable it is in the sight of Allah that you may preach what you do not practice.
Indeed Allah likes those who fight in His cause, positioned in rows, as if they were an edifice fortified.
And remember when Moosa said to his people, “O my people! Why do you trouble me, whereas you know that I am Allah’s Noble Messenger towards you?”
So when they deviated, Allah deviated their hearts; and Allah does not guide the sinning people.
And remember when Eisa the son of Maryam said, “O Descendants of Israel! Indeed I am Allah’s Noble Messenger towards you, confirming the Book Torah which was before me, and heralding glad tidings of the Noble Messenger who will come after me – his name is Ahmed (the Praised One)”; so when Ahmed came to them with clear proofs, they said, “This is an obvious magic.”
And who is more unjust than one who fabricates a lie against Allah whereas he is being called towards Islam?
And Allah does not guide the unjust people.
They wish to put out Allah’s light with their mouths, whereas Allah will perfect His light even if the disbelievers get annoyed.
It is He Who has sent His Noble Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth, in order that He may make it prevail over all other religions, even if the polytheists get annoyed.
O People who Believe! Shall I show you a trade that can save you from the painful punishment?
Have faith in Allah and His Noble Messenger, and fight in Allah’s cause with your wealth and your lives; this is better for you, if you understand.
He will forgive you your sins and admit you into Gardens beneath which rivers flow, and superb dwellings in everlasting Gardens of Eden; this is the greatest success.
And He will give you another favour, which is dear to you – the help from Allah and an imminent victory; and O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), give glad tidings to the Muslims.
O People who Believe! Become the aides of Allah’s religion, the way Eisa the son of Maryam had said to the disciples, “Who will help me, inclining towards Allah?”
The disciples said, “We are the aides of Allah’s religion” – so a group among the Descendants of Israel accepted faith and another group disbelieved; We therefore aided the believers against their enemies, so they were victorious.
All whatever is in the heavens and all whatever is in the earth proclaims the Purity of Allah, the King, the Most Pure, the Most Honourable, the Wise.
It is He Who has sent among the unlettered people a Noble Messenger from themselves, who recites His verses to them and purifies them, and bestows them the knowledge of the Book and wisdom; and indeed before this, they were in open error.
And he (the Holy Prophet) bestows knowledge to others along with them, who have not yet joined them; and He only is the Most Honourable, the Wise.
This is Allah’s munificence, which He may give to whomever He wills; and Allah is Extremely Munificent.
The example of those who were entrusted with the Taurat, and did not carry out its commands, is like the donkey carrying books; what a wretched example is of the people who denied the signs of Allah; and Allah does not guide the unjust.
Say “O Jews! If you assume that you are Allah’s friends, others are not, then wish for death if you are truthful!”
And they will never wish for it because of the misdeeds their hands have sent ahead; and Allah well knows the unjust.
Proclaim (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “Indeed death which you run away from will surely confront you, then you will be returned to Him Who knows all the hidden and the visible – He will then inform you of what you did.”
O People who Believe! When the call for prayer is given on (Friday) the day of congregation, rush towards the remembrance of Allah and stop buying and selling; this is better for you if you understand.
And when the prayer ends, spread out in the land and seek Allah’s munificence, and profusely remember Allah, in the hope of attaining success.
And when they see some trade or sport, they move towards it and leave you standing delivering the sermon; proclaim, “That which is with Allah, is better than sport and trade; and the sustenance of Allah is the best.”
When the hypocrites come in your presence (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) they say, “We testify that you surely are Allah’s Noble Messenger”; and Allah knows that you indeed are His Noble Messenger, and Allah testifies that the hypocrites are indeed liars.
They have taken their oaths as a shield, thereby prevented others from Allah’s way; indeed they commit extremely evil deeds.
That is because they accepted faith with their tongues then disbelieved with their hearts, therefore their hearts were sealed – so now they do not understand anything.
And when you see them, their appearance would please you; and when they speak, you would listen carefully to their speech; like wooden blocks propped against the wall; they assume every cry to be against them; they are the enemy, so beware of them; may Allah slay them! Where are they reverting!
And when it is said to them, “Come! Allah’s Noble Messenger may seek forgiveness for you” – they turn heads away, and you will see them turning away in pride.
It is the same for them, whether you seek forgiveness for them or do not seek forgiveness for them; Allah will never forgive them; indeed Allah does not guide the sinning people.
It is they who say, “Do not spend upon those who are with Allah’s Noble Messenger until they get distraught”; whereas to Allah only belong the treasures of the heavens and the earth, but the hypocrites do not have sense.
They say, “If we return to Medinah, then indeed the honourable group will soon expel the lowly one”; whereas all honour belongs to Allah and to His Noble Messenger and to the Muslims, but the hypocrites do not know.
O People who Believe! May not your wealth or your children cause you to neglect the remembrance of Allah; and whoever does this – so it is they who are in a loss.
And spend from what We have provided you before death approaches any one of you and he then says, “My Lord!
Why did you not give me respite for a little while, so I would have given charity and become of the virtuous?”
And Allah will never give respite to any soul when its promise arrives; and Allah is Aware of your deeds.
All whatever is in the heavens and all whatever is in the earth proclaims the Purity of Allah; His only is the kingship and His only is all praise; and He is Able to do all things.
It is He Who has created you, so among you one is a disbeliever whereas another is a Muslim; and Allah is seeing your deeds.
He created the heavens and the earth with the truth, and fashioned you thereby making you in best shapes; and towards Him only is the return.
He knows all whatever is in the heavens and in the earth, and He knows all what you hide and all what you disclose; and Allah knows what lies within the hearts.
Did not the news of those who disbelieved before you reach you?
So they tasted the evil outcome of their deeds, and for them is a painful punishment.
This is because their Noble Messengers used to bring clear proofs to them, in response they said, “What!
Will humans show us the way?”; they therefore became disbelievers and turned away, and Allah acted independently; and Allah is the Independent, the Most Praiseworthy.
The disbelievers alleged that they will surely not be raised again; proclaim (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “Surely yes, why not?
By oath of Lord, you will surely be raised again and you will then be informed of your misdeeds; and this is easy for Allah.”
Therefore accept faith in Allah and His Noble Messenger and the light which We have sent down; and Allah is Well Aware of what you do.
The day when He will gather you, on the Day of Collective Assembly – that is the day when the loss of the losers will be laid bare; and whoever believes in Allah and does good deeds, Allah will relieve him of his sins and admit him into Gardens beneath which rivers flow, for them to abide in it forever; this is the greatest success.
And those who disbelieved and denied Our signs, are the people of the fire – to remain in it forever; and what a wretched outcome!
No misfortune befalls except by Allah’s command; and Allah will guide the heart of whoever accepts faith in Him; and Allah knows all things.
And obey Allah and obey His Noble Messenger; then if you turn away, know that the duty upon Our Noble Messenger is only to plainly convey.
Allah – there is none worthy of worship except Him; and only upon Allah must the Muslims rely.
O People who Believe! Some of your wives and children are your enemies, therefore be wary of them; and if you pardon and overlook and forgive, then indeed Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
Your wealth and your children are just a test; and with Allah is a tremendous reward.
Therefore fear Allah as much as possible, and heed the commands, and obey, and spend in Allah’s cause, for your own good; and whoever is rescued from the greed of his own soul – is they who will be successful.
If you lend an excellent loan to Allah, He will double it for you and forgive you; and Allah is Most Appreciative, Most Forbearing.
The All Knowing of all things hidden and visible, the Most Honourable, the Wise.
O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him)!
When you people divorce women, divorce them at the time of their completing the appointed period, and keep count of the appointed period; and fear Allah, your Lord; do not expel them from their houses during the appointed period nor should they leave on their own, unless they bring about some matter of blatant lewdness; and these are the limits of Allah; and whoever crosses Allah’s limits has indeed wronged himself; do you not know, it is likely that Allah may send some new decree after this?
So when they are about to reach their appointed term, hold them back with kindness or separate them with kindness, and make two just men among you as witnesses, and establish the testimony for Allah; with this is advised whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day; and whoever fears Allah – Allah will create for him a way of deliverance.
And will provide him sustenance from a place he had never expected; and whoever relies on Allah – then Allah is Sufficient for him; indeed Allah will accomplish His command; indeed Allah has set a proper measure for all things.
And for those of your women who have no hope of menstruation, if you doubt, the appointed period is three months – and also for those who have not yet had menstruation; and the appointed period for the pregnant women is up to the time they deliver their burden; and whoever fears Allah – Allah will create ease for him in his affairs.
This is Allah’s command that He has sent down towards you; and whoever fears Allah – Allah will relieve his sins and bestow upon him a great reward.
Accommodate them where you also reside, according to your means, and do not harass them to make it difficult upon them; and if they are pregnant, give them the provision till they deliver their burden; then if they suckle the child for you, pay them its due; and consult with each other in a reasonable manner; and if you create hardship for one another, the child will get another breast feeding nurse.
Whoever has the capacity must give provisions according to his means; and the one whose sustenance is restricted upon him, must give provisions from what Allah has given him; Allah does not burden any soul except according to what He has given it; Allah will soon, after the hardship, create ease.
And many a town existed that rebelled against the command of its Lord and His Noble Messengers, so We took a severe account from it – and struck them with a dreadful punishment.
They therefore tasted the evil outcome of their deeds, and the outcome of their deeds was a loss.
Allah has kept prepared a severe punishment for them – therefore fear Allah, O men of intellect! O People who Believe!
Allah has sent down a Remembrance (or an honour) for you. (The Holy Prophet is a Remembrance from Allah.)
The Noble Messenger who recites the clear verses of Allah to you, so that he may take those who accept faith and do good deeds, away from the realms of darkness towards light; and whoever accepts faith in Allah and does good deeds, Allah will admit him into Gardens beneath which rivers flow, to abide in them for ever and ever; indeed Allah has kept an excellent sustenance for him.
It is Allah Who has created the seven heavens, and seven earthly worlds like them; the command descends within them, so that you may know that Allah is Able to do all things, and that Allah’s knowledge encompasses everything.
O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him)! Why do you forbid for yourself the things that Allah has made lawful for you?
You wish to please some of your wives; and Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
Allah has ordained expiation for your oaths; and Allah is your Master; and Allah is the All Knowing, the Wise.
And when the Holy Prophet confided a matter to one of his wives; so when she disclosed it and Allah conveyed this to the Holy Prophet, he told her part of it and held back a part; so when the Holy Prophet informed her about it, she said, “Who informed you?”; he said, “The All Knowing, the All Aware has informed me.”
If you both, the wives of the Holy Prophet, incline towards Allah, for indeed your hearts have deviated a little; and if you come together against him (the Holy Prophet – peace and blessings be upon him) then indeed Allah is his Supporter, and Jibreel and the virtuous believers are also his aides; and in addition the angels are also his aides. (Allah has created several supporters for the believers.)
It is likely that, if he divorces you, his Lord will give him wives better than you in your place -widows and maidens who are obedient, believing, respectful, penitent, serving and fasting.
O People who Believe! Save yourselves and your families from the fire, the fuel of which is men and stones – appointed over it are the extremely strict angels, who do not refuse the command of Allah and carry out whatever they are commanded.
“O disbelievers! Do not feign excuses this day; you will only be repaid what you used to do.”
O People who Believe!
Incline towards Allah in a repentance that becomes a guidance for the future; it is likely that your Lord will relieve you of your sins and admit you into Gardens beneath which rivers flow – on the day when Allah will not humble the Prophet and the believers along with him; their light will be running ahead of them and on their right; they will say, “Our Lord! Perfect our light for us, and forgive us; indeed You are Able to do all things.”
O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), wage holy war against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be strict with them; and their destination is hell; and what a wretched outcome!
Allah illustrates the example of the disbelievers – the wife of Nooh and the wife of Lut; they were bonded in marriage to two of Our bondmen deserving Our proximity – they then betrayed them so they did not benefit them the least against Allah and it was declared, “Both of you women enter the fire, along with others who enter.”
And Allah illustrates an example of the Muslims – the wife of Firaun; when she prayed, “My Lord!
Build a house for me near You, in Paradise, and deliver me from Firaun and his works, and rescue me from the unjust people.”
And the example of Maryam the daughter of Imran, who guarded her chastity – We therefore breathed into her a Spirit from Ourselves – and she testified for the Words of her Lord and His Books, and was among the obedient.
Most Auspicious is He in Whose control is the entire kingship; and He is Able to do all things.
The One Who created death and life to test you – who among you has the better deeds; and He only is the Most Honourable, the Oft Forgiving.
The One Who created the seven heavens atop each other; do you see any discrepancy in the creation of the Most Gracious?
Therefore lift your gaze – do you see any cracks?
Then lift your gaze again, your gaze will return towards you, unsuccessful and weak.
And indeed We have beautified the lower heaven with lamps, and have made them weapons against the devils, and have kept prepared for them the punishment of the blazing fire.
And for those who disbelieved in their Lord, is the punishment of hell; and what a wretched outcome!
They will hear it hissing when they will be thrown into it, and it is boiling.
As if about to explode with rage; whenever a group is thrown into it, the guardians of hell will ask them, “Did not a Herald of Warning come to you?”
They will say, “Yes, why not – indeed a Herald of Warning did come to us – in response we denied and said ‘Allah has not sent down anything – you are not except in a great error’.”
And they will say, “Had we listened or understood, we would not have been among the people of hell.”
So now they admit their sins! Therefore accursed be the people of hell!
Indeed for those who fear their Lord without seeing is forgiveness, and a great reward.
And whether you speak softly or proclaim it aloud; He indeed knows what lies within the hearts!
What! Will He Who has created not know?
Whereas He knows every detail, the All Aware!
It is He Who subjected the earth for you, therefore tread its paths and eat from Allah’s sustenance; and towards Him is the resurrection.
Have you become unafraid of the One Who controls the heavens, that He will not cause you to sink into the earth when it trembles?
Or have you become unafraid of the One Who controls the heavens, that He will not send a torrent of stones upon you?
So now you will realise, how My warning turned out!
And indeed those before them had denied – therefore how did My rejection turn out!
And did they not see the birds above them, spreading and closing their wings?
None except the Most Gracious holds them up; indeed He sees all things.
Or which army do you have that will help you against the Most Gracious?
The disbelievers are in nothing except an illusion.
Or who is such that will give you sustenance if Allah stops His sustenance?
In fact they persist in rebellion and hatred.
So is one who walks inverted upon his face more rightly guided, or one who walks upright on the Straight Path?
Proclaim (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “It is He Who created you, and made ears and eyes and hearts for you; very little thanks do you offer!”
Say, “It is He Who has spread you out in the earth, and towards Him you will be raised.”
And they say, “When will this promise come, if you are truthful?”
Proclaim, “Surely Allah has its knowledge; and I am only a Herald of plain warning.”
So when they will see it close, the faces of the disbelievers will become ghastly, and it will be declared, “This is what you were demanding.”
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “What is your opinion –Allah may either destroy me and those with me, or have mercy on us – so who is such that will protect the disbelievers from the painful punishment?”
Proclaim, “He only is the Most Gracious – we have accepted faith in Him and have relied only upon Him; so you will now realise who is in open error.”
Say, “What is your opinion – if in the morning all your water were to sink into the earth, then who is such who can bring you water flowing before you?”
Nuun* – by oath of the pen and by oath of what is written by it. (Alphabet of the Arabic language; Allah and to whomever He reveals, know their precise meanings.)
You are not insane, by the munificence of your Lord.
And indeed for you is an unlimited reward.
And indeed you possess an exemplary character.
So very soon, you will see and they too will realise –
- That who among you was insane.
Indeed your Lord well knows those who have strayed from His path, and He well knows those who are upon guidance.
Therefore do not listen to the deniers.
They wish that in some way you may yield, so they too might soften their stand.
Nor ever listen to any excessive oath maker, ignoble person.
The excessively insulting one, spreader of spite.
One who excessively forbids the good, transgressor, sinner.
Foul mouthed, and in addition to all this, of improper lineage.
Because he* has some wealth and sons. (Walid bin Mugaira, who cursed the Holy Prophet.)
When Our verses are recited to him, he says, “These are stories of earlier people.”
We will soon singe his pig-nose.
We have indeed tested them the way We had tested the owners of the garden when they swore that they would reap its harvest the next morning.
And they did not say, “If Allah wills”.
So an envoy from your Lord completed his round upon the garden, whilst they were sleeping.
So in the morning it became as if harvested.
They then called out to each other at daybreak.
That, “Go to your fields at early morn, if you want to harvest.”
So they went off, while whispering to one another.
“Make sure that no needy person enters your garden this day.”
And they left at early morn, assuming they were in control of their purpose.
Then when they saw it, they said, “We have indeed strayed.”
“In fact, we are unfortunate.”
The best among them said, “Did I not tell you, ‘Why do you not proclaim His purity?’”
They said, “Purity is to our Lord – we have indeed been unjust.”
So they came towards each other, blaming.
They said, “Woe to us – we were indeed rebellious.”
“Hopefully, our Lord will give us a better replacement than this – we now incline towards our Lord.”
Such is the punishment; and indeed the punishment of the Hereafter is the greatest, if only they knew!
Indeed for the pious, with their Lord, are Gardens of Serenity.
Shall We equate the Muslims to the guilty?
What is the matter with you?
What sort of a judgement you impose!
Is there a Book for you, from which you read?
- That for you in it is whatever you like?
Or is it that you have a covenant from Us, right up to the Day of Judgement, that you will get all what you claim?
Ask them, who among them is a guarantor for it?
Or is it that they have partners in worship?
So they should bring their appointed partners, if they are truthful.
On the day when the Shin* will be exposed and they will be called to prostrate themselves, they will be unable. (Used as a metaphor)
With lowered eyes, disgrace overcoming them; and indeed they used to be called to prostrate themselves whilst they were healthy.
Therefore leave the one who denies this matter, to Me; We shall soon steadily take them away, from a place they do not know.
And I will give them respite; indeed My plan is very solid.
Or is it that you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) ask any fee from them, so they are burdened with the penalty?
Or that they possess the hidden, so they are writing it?
Therefore wait for your Lord’s command, and do not be like the one of the fish; who cried out when he was distraught. (Prophet Yunus – peace be upon him.)
Were it not for his Lord’s favour that reached him, he would have surely been cast onto the desolate land, reproached.
His Lord therefore chose him and made him among those deserving His proximity.
And indeed the disbelievers seem as if they would topple you with their evil gaze when they hear the Qur’an, and they say, “He is indeed insane.”
Whereas it is not but an advice to the entire creation!
The true event!
How tremendous is the true event!
And what have you understood, how tremendous the true event is!
The tribes of Thamud and A’ad denied the event of great dismay. (The Day of Resurrection)
So regarding the Thamud, they were destroyed by a terrible scream.
And as for A’ad, they were destroyed by a severe thundering windstorm.
He forced it upon them with strength, consecutively for seven nights and eight days – so you would see those people overthrown in it, like trunks of date palms fallen down.
So do you see any survivor among them?
And Firaun, and those before him, and the dwellings that were inverted and thrown, had brought error.
They therefore disobeyed the Noble Messengers of their Lord – so He seized them with an intense seizure.
Indeed when the water swelled up, We boarded you onto the ship.
In order to make it a remembrance for you, and in order that the ears that store may remember.
So when the Trumpet will be blown, with a sudden single blow.
And the earth and the mountains will be lifted up and crushed with a single crush.
So that is the day when the forthcoming event will occur.
And the heaven will split asunder – so on that day it will be unstable.
And the angels will be on its sides; and on that day, eight angels will carry the Throne of your Lord above them.
On that day all of you will be brought forth, so none among you wishing to hide will be able to hide.
So whoever is given his book in his right hand – he will say, “Take, read my account!”
“I was certain that I will confront my account.”
He is therefore in the desired serenity.
In a lofty Garden –
The fruit clusters of which are hanging down.
“Eat and drink with pleasure – the reward of what you sent ahead, in the past days.”
And whoever is given his book in his left hand – he will say, “Alas, if only my account were not given to me!”
“And had never come to know my account!”
“Alas, if only it had been just death.”
“My wealth did not in the least benefit me.”
“All my power has vanished.”
It will be said, “Seize him, and shackle him.”
“Then hurl him into the blazing fire.”
“Then bind him inside a chain which is seventy arm-lengths.”
“Indeed he refused to accept faith in Allah, the Greatest.”
“And did not urge to feed the needy.”
“So he does not have any friend here this day.”
“Nor any food except the pus discharged from the people of hell.”
“Which none except the guilty shall eat.”
So by oath of the things you see.
And by oath of those you do not see.
This Qur’an is the speech of Allah with a gracious Noble Messenger.
And it is not the speech of a poet; how little do you believe!
Nor is it the speech of a soothsayer; how little do you ponder!
Sent down by the Lord Of The Creation.
And had he fabricated just one matter upon Us –
We would have definitely taken revenge from him.
Then would have cut off his heart’s artery.
Then none among you would be his saviour.
And indeed this Qur’an is an advice for the pious.
And indeed We know that some among you are deniers.
And indeed it is a despair for the disbelievers.
And indeed it is a certain Truth.
Therefore (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), proclaim the purity of your Lord, the Greatest.
A requester seeks the punishment that will take place –
- Upon the disbelievers – the punishment that none can avert.
From Allah, the Lord of all pinnacles.
The angels and Jibreel, ascend towards Him – the punishment will befall on a day which spans fifty thousand years.
Therefore patiently endure, in the best manner (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him).
They deem it to be remote.
Whereas We see it impending.
The day when the sky will be like molten silver.
And the hills will be light as wool.
And no friend will ask concerning his friend.
They will be seeing them; the guilty will wish if only he could redeem himself from the punishment of that day, by offering his sons.
And his wife and his brother.
And the family in which he was.
And all those who are in the earth – then only if the redemption saves him!
Never!
That is indeed a blazing fire.
A fire that melts the hide.
It calls out to him who reverted and turned away.
And accumulated wealth and hoarded it.
Indeed man is created very impatient, greedy.
Very nervous when touched by misfortune.
And refraining, when good reaches him.
Except those who establish prayer.
Those who are regular in their prayers.
And those in whose wealth exists a recognised right,
For those who beg, and for the needy who cannot even ask.
And those who believe the Day of Judgement to be true.
And those who fear the punishment of their Lord.
Indeed the punishment of their Lord is not a thing to be unafraid of!
And those who protect their private organs (from adultery).
Except with their wives and the bondwomen in their possession, for there is no reproach on them.
So those who desire more than this – it is they who are the transgressors.
And those who protect the property entrusted to them, and their agreements.
And those who are firm upon their testimonies.
And those who protect their prayers.
It is these who will be honoured in Gardens.
So what is the matter with these disbelievers, that they stare at you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him)?
From the right and the left, in groups?
Does every man among them aspire to be admitted into the Garden of serenity?
Never!
We have indeed created them from a thing they know.
So I swear by the Lord of every East and every West, that We are indeed Able.
To replace them by those better than them; and none can escape from Us.
Therefore leave them, involved in their indecencies and play, till they confront their day which they are promised.
A day when they will come out of the graves in haste, as if rushing towards their goals.
With lowered eyes, disgrace overcoming them; this is the day, which they had been promised.
Indeed We sent Nooh towards his people saying that, “Warn your people before the painful punishment comes upon them.”
He said, “O my people!
I am indeed a Herald of clear warnings to you.”
“That you must worship Allah and fear Him, and obey me.”
“He will forgive you some of your sins, and give you respite up to an appointed term; indeed the promise of Allah cannot be averted when it arrives; if only you knew.”
He said, “My Lord! I invited my people night and day.”
“So for them, my calling them increased their fleeing away.”
“And whenever I called them, so that You may forgive them, they always thrust their fingers into their ears, and covered themselves with their clothes, and remained stubborn and were extremely haughty.”
“I then called them openly.”
“Then I also told them publicly and also spoke to them softly in private.”
“I therefore told them, ‘Seek forgiveness from your Lord; He is indeed Most Forgiving.’
‘He will send down abundant rain for you from the sky.’
‘And will aid you with wealth and sons, and will create gardens for you and cause rivers to flow for you.’
‘What is the matter with you, that you do not desire honour from Allah?’
‘Whereas it is He Who created you in different stages?’
‘Do you not see how Allah has created the seven heavens atop each other?’
‘And in them, has illuminated the moon, and made the sun a lamp?’
‘And it is Allah Who made you grow like vegetation from the earth.’
‘And He will then take you back to it, and again remove you from it.”
‘And it is Allah Who made the earth a bed for you.’
‘So that you may tread the wide roads in it.’”
Prayed Nooh, “O my Lord! They have disobeyed me, and they follow the one whose wealth and children increase nothing for him except ruin.”
“And they carried out a very sinister scheme.”
“And they said, ‘Do not ever abandon your Gods – and never abandon Wadd, or Suwa – or Yaghuth or Yauq or Nasr.’”
“And they have misled a large number; and (I pray that) You increase nothing for the unjust except error.”
Because of their sins they were drowned and then put into the fire; so they did not find any supporter for themselves against Allah.
(Punishment in the grave is proven by this verse.)
And prayed Nooh, “O my Lord! Do not leave any of the disbelievers dwelling in the land.”
“Indeed, if You spare them, they will mislead your bondmen – and their descendants, if any, will be none except the wicked, very ungrateful.”
“O my Lord! Forgive me, and my parents, and the believers who are in my house, and all other Muslim men and Muslim women; and do not increase anything for the unjust except ruin.”
Proclaim (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “I have received the divine revelation that some jinns attentively listened to my recitation, so they said, ‘We have heard a unique Qur’an.’
‘That guides to the path of goodness, we have therefore accepted faith in it; and we shall never ascribe anyone as a partner to our Lord.’
‘And that our Lord’s Majesty is Supreme – He has neither chosen a wife nor a child.’
‘And that the fool among us used to utter false exaggerations against Allah.’
‘Whereas we thought that men and jinns would never fabricate a lie against Allah!’
‘And indeed some men among humans used to take the protection of some men among jinns, so it further increased their haughtiness.’
‘And that they assumed, like you humans assume, that Allah would not send any Noble Messenger.’
‘And we reached the sky, so we found it strongly guarded and filled with comets.’
‘And that we sometimes used to sit in some places in the sky, to listen; so whoever now listens finds a fiery comet waiting for him.’
‘And we do not know whether harm is intended for those on the earth, or whether their Lord intends goodness for them.’
‘And among us some are virtuous and some are the other type; we are split into several branches.’
‘And we are certain that we cannot defeat Allah in the earth, nor can we run out of His grasp.’
‘And that when we heard the guidance, we accepted faith in it; so whoever accepts faith in his Lord, has no fear – neither of any loss nor of any injustice.’
‘And that some among us are Muslims and some are the unjust; and whoever has accepted Islam – it is they who have thought rightly.’
‘And as for the unjust – they are the fuel of hell.’”
And proclaim (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “I have received the divine revelation that ‘Had they remained upright on the straight path, We would have given them abundant water.’
‘In order to test them with it; and whoever turns away from the remembrance of his Lord – He will put him in a punishment that keeps on increasing.’
‘And that the mosques are for Allah only – therefore do not worship anyone along with Allah.’
‘And that when Allah’s bondman stood up to worship Him, the jinns had almost crowded upon him.’”
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “I worship only Allah, and I do not ascribe any partner to Him.”
Proclaim (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “I am not the master of any harm or benefit for you.”
Say, “No one will ever save me from Allah, and other than Him, I will not find any refuge.”
“I only convey the commands from Allah, and His messages; and whoever disobeys the commands of Allah and His Noble Messenger – then indeed for him is the fire of hell, in which they will remain for ever and ever.”
Till the time when they will see what they are promised – so they will now come to know whose aide is weak, and who is lesser in number.
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “I do not know whether what you are promised is close or if my Lord will postpone it for a while.”
The All Knowing of all the hidden does not give anyone the control over His secrets.
Except to His chosen Noble Messengers – so He appoints guards in front and behind him.
(Allah gave the knowledge of the hidden to the Holy Prophet – peace and blessings be upon him.)
In order to see that they have conveyed the messages of their Lord – and His knowledge encompasses all whatever they have, and He has kept all things accounted for.
O the One Wrapped in piety! (Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him)
Stand up for worship during the night, except for some part of it.
For half the night, or reduce some from it.
Or increase a little upon it, and recite the Qur’an slowly in stages.
Indeed We shall soon ordain a heavy responsibility upon you.
Indeed getting up in the night is tougher, and the words flow with strength.
Indeed you have a lot of matters during the day.
And remember the name of your Lord and, leaving others, devote yourself solely to Him.
Lord of the East and Lord of the West – there is no God except Him, therefore make Him your sole Trustee of affairs.
And patiently endure upon what the disbelievers say, and leave them for good.
And leave them to Me – these wealthy deniers – and give them some respite.
Indeed We have heavy fetters and a blazing fire.
And food that chokes, and a painful punishment.
On a day when the earth and the mountains will tremble, and the mountains turn into dunes of flowing sand.
We have indeed sent a Noble Messenger towards you, a present witness over you – the way We had sent a Noble Messenger towards Firaun.
In response Firaun disobeyed the Noble Messenger, so We seized him with a severe seizure.
So how will you save yourselves, if you disbelieve, on a day that will turn children old?
The heaven will split asunder with its grief; the promise of Allah will surely occur.
This is indeed an advice; so whoever wishes may take the path towards his Lord.
Indeed your Lord knows that you stand up in prayer, sometimes almost two-thirds of the night, and sometimes half the night or sometimes a third of it – and also a group of those along with you; Allah keeps measure of the night and day; He knows that you, O Muslims, will not be able to measure the night, so He has inclined towards you with mercy – therefore recite from the Qur’an as much as is easy for you; He knows that soon some of you will fall ill, and some will travel in the land seeking the munificence of Allah, and some will be fighting in Allah’s cause; therefore recite from the Qur’an as much as is easy for you, and establish prayer and pay the obligatory charity, and lend an excellent loan to Allah; and whatever good you send ahead for yourselves, you will find it with Allah, better and having a great reward; and seek forgiveness from Allah; indeed Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
O the Cloaked One! (Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him)
Rise up and warn!
And proclaim the Purity of your Lord.
And keep your clothes clean.
And stay away from idols.
And do not favour others in order to receive more.
And for the sake of your Lord, patiently endure.
So when the Trumpet will be blown.
So that is a tough day.
Not easy upon the disbelievers.
Leave him to Me, the one whom I created single.
And gave him vast wealth.
And gave him sons present before him.
And made several preparations for him.
Yet he desires that I should give more.
Never! For he is an enemy to Our signs!
Soon I shall mount him on Saood, the hill of fire.
Indeed he thought, and inwardly decided.
So accursed be he, how evilly did he decide!
Again accursed be he, how evilly did he decide!
He then dared to lift his gaze.
Then frowned and grimaced.
Then he turned away, and was haughty.
And said, “This is nothing but magic learnt from earlier men.”
“This is nothing but the speech of a man.”
I will soon fling him into hell.
And what have you understood, what hell is!
It neither leaves, nor spares.
It strips away the hide of man.
Above it are nineteen guards.
We have not appointed the guards of hell, except angels; and did not keep this number except to test the disbelievers – in order that the People given the Book(s) may be convinced, and to increase the faith of the believers – and so that the People given the Book(s) and the Muslims may not have any doubt – and so that those in whose hearts is a disease and the disbelievers, may say, “What does Allah mean by this amazing example?” This is how Allah sends astray whomever He wills, and guides whomever He wills; and no one knows the armies of Allah except Him; and this is not but an advice to man.
Yes, never!* By oath of the moon. (Hell will never spare the disbelievers).
And by oath of the night when it turns back.
And by oath of the morning, when it spreads light.
Indeed hell is one of the greatest entities.
Warn the men.
For the one among you who wishes to come forward or stay back.
Every soul is mortgaged for its own deeds.
Except those on the right side.
In Gardens, they seek answers,
- From the guilty.
“What took you into the hell?”
They said, “We never used to offer the prayer.”
“Nor used to feed the needy.”
“And used to dwell on evil matters with those who think evilly.”
“And used to deny the Day of Justice.”
“Till death overcame us.”
So the intercession of the intercessors will not benefit them. (The disbelievers will not have any intercessor.)
So what is the matter with them that they turn away from the advice?
As if they were startled donkeys –
Fleeing away from a lion.
Rather each one of them desires that he should be given open Books.
Never!
In fact they do not fear the Hereafter.
Yes indeed, this is an advice.
So whoever wills may heed advice from it.
And what advice will they heed, except if Allah wills?
Only He deserves to be feared, and His only is the greatness of forgiving.
I swear by the Day of Resurrection.
And by oath of the soul that reproaches itself.
Does man assume that We will never assemble his bones?
Surely yes, why not? We can properly make all his phalanxes.
In fact man wishes to commit evil in front of Him!
He asks, “When will be the Day of Resurrection?”
So when the eyes will be blinded by light.
And the moon will be eclipsed.
And the sun and the moon will be united.
On that day man will cry out, “Where shall I flee?”
Never!
There is no refuge!
On that day, the station is only towards your Lord.
On that day, man will be informed of all what he sent ahead and left behind.
In fact, man himself is keeping an eye on his state of affairs!
And even if he presents all the excuses he has, none will be listened to.
O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), do not cause your tongue to move along with the Qur’an in order to learn it faster.
Indeed assembling the Qur’an and reading it are upon Us.
So when We have read it, you should thereupon follow what is read.
Then indeed, to explain its details to you is upon Us.
None except you, O disbelievers – you love what you have, the fleeting one.
And you have forsaken the Hereafter.
On that day, some faces will shine with freshness.
Looking toward their Lord.
And on that day some faces will be ghastly.
Knowing that they will be subjected to a torment that breaks the backs.
Yes indeed, when the soul will reach up to the throat.
And they will say, “Is there any one – any magician?”
And he will realise that this is the parting.
And one shin will curl up with the other shin.
On that day, the herding will be only towards your Lord.
Neither did he believe it to be true, nor did he offer the prayer.
But he denied and turned away.
Then he went back to his home in pride.
Your ruin has come close, still closer.
Again your ruin has come close, still closer.
Does man assume that he will be let loose?
Was he not just a drop of the semen that is discharged?
He then became a clot – so Allah created him, then made him proper.
So created from him a pair, the male and female.
So will He, Who has done all this, not be able to revive the dead?
Indeed there has been a time for man, when even his name did not exist anywhere.
Indeed We have created man from mixed semen; in order to test him – We therefore made him hearing, knowing.
We have indeed shown him the way – whether he is grateful or ingrate.
We have indeed kept prepared chains, and shackles and a blazing fire for the disbelievers.
Indeed the virtuous will drink from a cup, containing a mixture of Kafoor.
The Kafoor is a spring, from which the chosen bondmen of Allah will drink, causing it to flow wherever they wish inside their palaces.
They fulfil their pledges, and fear a day the evil of which is widespread.
And out of His love, they give food to the needy, the orphan and the prisoner.
They say to them, “We give you food, only for the sake of Allah – we do not seek any reward or thanks from you.”
“Indeed we fear from our Lord a day which is extremely bitter, most severe.”
So Allah saved them from the evil of that day, and gave them freshness and joy.
And gave them Paradise and silk clothes, as a reward for their patience.
Reclining in it, upon thrones; they will not see the hot sunshine in it, nor the bitter cold.
And its shade will cover them, and its fruit clusters brought down low for them.
Rounds of silver cups and silver beakers, looking like glass, will be presented upon them.
Glass made from silver, which the servers have filled up to the measure.
And in Paradise they will be given to drink cups, filled with a mixture of ginger.
Which is a spring in Paradise called Salsabeel.
Immortal youths shall surround them, waiting upon them; when you see them, you would think they are scattered pearls.
And when you look towards it, you will see serenity and a great kingdom.
In it they adorn clothes of fine green silk and gold embroidery; and they are given silver bracelets to wear; and their Lord gave them pure wine to drink.
It will be said to them, “This is your reward – indeed your efforts have been appreciated.”
Indeed We have sent down the Qur’an upon you, in stages.
Therefore stay patient upon your Lord’s command, and do not listen to any of the sinners or ingrates among them.
And remember the name of your Lord morning and evening.
And prostrate for Him in a part of the night, and proclaim His purity into the long night.
Indeed these people love what they have, the fleeting one, and have forsaken the immensely important day behind them.
It is We Who created them, and strengthened their skeleton; and We can replace them with others like them, whenever We will.
This is indeed an advice; so whoever wishes may take the path towards his Lord.
And what will you wish, except if Allah wills; indeed Allah is All Knowing, Wise.
He admits into His mercy, whomever He wills; and for the unjust He has kept prepared a painful punishment.
By oath of those that are sent, one after the other. (The verses of the Holy Qur’an or the angels or the winds).
Then by oath of those that push with a strong gust.
Then by oath of those that lift and carry.
Then by those that clearly differentiate the right and wrong.
And then by those that instil Remembrance into the hearts.
To complete the argument or to warn.
Indeed what you are promised, will surely befall.
So when the lights of the stars are put out.
And when the sky is split apart.
And when the mountains are made into dust and blown away.
And when the time of the Noble Messengers arrives.
For which day were they appointed?
For the Day of Decision.
And what do you know, what the Day of Decision is!
Ruin is for the deniers on that day!
Did We not destroy the earlier people?
We shall then send the latter after them.
This is how We deal with the guilty.
Ruin is for the deniers on that day!
Did We not create you from an abject fluid?
We then kept it in a safe place.
For a known calculated term.
We then calculated; so how excellently do We control!
Ruin is for the deniers on that day!
Did We not make the earth a storehouse?
For the living and the dead among you?
And We placed high mountains as anchors in it and gave you sweet water to drink.
Ruin is for the deniers on that day!
“Move towards what you used to deny!”
“Move towards the shadow of the smoke having three branches.”
“Which neither gives shade, nor saves from the flame.”
Indeed hell throws up sparks like huge castles.
Seeming like yellow camels.
Ruin is for the deniers on that day!
This is a day in which they will not be able to speak.
Nor will they be given permission to present excuses.
Ruin is for the deniers on that day!
This is the Day of Decision; We have gathered you and all the earlier men.
If you now have any conspiracy, carry it out on Me.
Ruin is for the deniers on that day!
Indeed the pious are in shade and springs.
And among fruits whichever they may desire.
“Eat and drink with pleasure, the reward of your deeds.”
This is how We reward the virtuous.
Ruin is for the deniers on that day!
“Eat and enjoy for a while – indeed you are guilty.”
Ruin is for the deniers on that day!
And when it is said to them, “Offer the prayer” – they do not!
Ruin is for the deniers on that day!
So after this, in what matter will they believe?
What are they questioning each other about?
About the great tidings!
Regarding which they hold different views.
Surely yes, they will soon come to know!
Again surely yes, they will soon come to know!
Did We not make the earth a bed?
And the mountains as pegs?
And it is We who created you in pairs.
And made your sleep a rest.
And made the night a cover.
And made the day for seeking livelihood.
And built seven strong roofs above you.
And have kept a very bright lamp in it.
And then sent down hard rain from the water bearing clouds.
In order to produce grain and plants with it.
And dense gardens.
Indeed the Day of Decision is a time fixed.
The day when the Trumpet will be blown – you will therefore come forth in multitudes.
And the heaven will be opened – it therefore becomes like gates.
And the mountains will be moved – they will therefore become like mirages.
Indeed hell is lying in ambush.
The destination of the rebellious.
They will remain in it for ages.
They will neither taste anything cool in it, nor anything to drink.
Except hot boiling water and hot pus discharged from the people of hell.
The reward to each is according to what he is.
Indeed they had no fear of the account.
And they denied Our signs to the extreme.
And We have kept recorded everything in a Book, accounted for.
Therefore taste it now – We shall not increase anything for you except the punishment.
Indeed the place of success is for the pious.
Gardens and grapes.
And maidens of a single age.
And an overflowing cup.
In which they shall neither hear lewd talk, nor any lie.
A reward from your Lord – a grossly sufficient bestowal.
Lord of the heavens and the earth, and all whatever is between them – the Most Gracious – with Whom no one will have the right to talk.
The day when Jibreel and all the angels will stand in rows; none will be able to speak except one whom the Most Gracious commands and who spoke rightly. (Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him – will be the first to be granted permission to intercede.)
That is the True Day; therefore whoever wills may take the path towards his Lord.
We warn you of a punishment that has come near; a day on which man will see what his own hands have sent ahead, and the disbeliever will say, “Alas – if only I were dust!”
By oath of those who harshly pull out the soul. (Of the disbeliever)
And who softly release the soul. (Of the believer)
And who glide with ease.
And who quickly present themselves.
And who plan the implementation.
On the day when the trembling one will tremble. (The disbelievers will certainly taste the punishment.)
And the following event will come after it.
Many a heart will flutter on that day!
Unable to lift their gaze.
The disbelievers say, “Will we really return to our former state?”
“When we have become decayed bones?”
They said, “So this return is an obvious loss!”
So that is not but a single shout.
So they will immediately be in an open plain.
Did the news of Moosa reach you?
When his Lord called him in the holy valley of Tuwa.
That “Go to Firaun – he has rebelled.”
“Tell him ‘Do you have the inclination to become pure?’
‘And I may guide you to your Lord, so that you may fear.’”
So Moosa showed him a magnificent sign.
In response, he denied and disobeyed.
He then turned away, striving in his effort.
So he gathered the people, and proclaimed.
And then said, “I am your most supreme lord.”
Allah therefore seized him, in the punishment of this world and the Hereafter.
Indeed in this is a lesson for one who fears.
Do you think that it is harder to create you or the heavens? Allah has created it.
He raised its roof and made it proper.
And He made its night dark, and started its light.
And after it spread out the earth.
And from it produced its water and its pasture.
And solidified the mountains.
In order to benefit you and your cattle.
So when the greatest universal disaster arrives,
On that day man will recall all what he strove for.
And hell will be made visible to all those who can see.
So for one who rebelled,
And preferred the worldly life,
Then indeed hell only is his destination.
And for one who feared to stand before his Lord and restrained his soul from desire,
Then indeed Paradise only is his destination.
They (the disbelievers) ask you regarding the Last Day, as to when is its appointed time.
What concern do you have regarding its explanation? (You are not bound to tell them)
Towards your Lord only is its conclusion.
You are but a Herald of Warning, for one who fears it.
The day when they will see it, it will seem as if they had not stayed on earth except for an evening or its morning.
He frowned and turned away.
Because the blind man had come in his august presence.
And what do you know, he may be of the pure!
Or that he may accept advice, so the advice may benefit him.
For him who does not care,
So you are after him!
And you have nothing to lose if he does not become pure.
And for him who came to you striving,
And whereas he fears,
So you leave him, and are engrossed elsewhere!
Not this way – this is the advice.
So whoever wishes may remember it.
On honourable pages.
Exalted, pure.
Written by the hands of emissaries.
Who are noble, virtuous.
May man be slain – how ungrateful he is!
From what did He create him?
From a drop of liquid; He created him and then set several measures for him.
Then eased the way for him.
Then gave him death, so had him put in the grave.
(As during the night of Holy Prophet’s ascension, when all the Prophets gathered behind him in the Al Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem. Or when Allah will raise everyone on the Day of Resurrection.)
Not one – he has not yet completed what he was commanded.
So man must look at his food.
That We watered it in abundance.
Then We split the earth properly.
Thereby produced grain in it.
And grapes and fodder,
And olives and date palms,
And dense gardens,
And fruits and grass,
In order to benefit you and your cattle.
So when the deafening Shout arrives,
On that day man will run away from his brother.
And from his mother and father,
And from his wife and sons.
On that day, each one has just one issue, which is enough for him.
Many a face will be glittering on that day.
Laughing, rejoicing.
And many a face will be covered with dust on that day.
Blackness overcoming them.
It is they, the disbelievers, the sinners.
When the sunlight is rolled up.
And when the stars fall down.
And when the mountains are driven.
And when milch camels roam abandoned.
And when wild animals are herded together.
And when the seas are set afire.
And when the souls are paired.
And when the girl-child who was buried alive is asked.
Upon what sin was she killed for.
And when the Records of Account are laid bare.
And when the heaven is torn away.
And when hell is further enflamed.
And when Paradise is brought near.
Every soul will then come know what it has brought.
So by oath of those that revolve. (The planets.)
Who move straight and stop.
And by oath of the night when it turns back.
And by oath of the morning when it takes birth.
This is indeed the recitation of an honoured Noble Messenger. (Angel Jibreel – peace and blessings be upon him.)
The mighty, the honoured in the presence of the Lord of the Throne.
The one who is obeyed, and trustworthy. (Other angels obey angel Jibreel).
And your companion is not insane.
And indeed he saw him on the clear horizon. (Prophet Mohammed saw Angel Jibreel in his true shape – peace and blessings be upon them).
And this Prophet is not miserly upon the hidden. (Allah gave the knowledge of the hidden to the Holy Prophet – peace and blessings be upon him.)
And the Qur’an is not the recitation of Satan the outcast.
So where are you going?
That is but an advice to the entire creation!
For the one among you who wishes to become upright.
And what will you wish, except if Allah wills – the Lord of the Creation.
When the heaven splits open.
And when the stars fall down.
And when the oceans are swept away.
And when the graves are overturned.
Every soul will come to know what it has sent ahead and what it left behind.
O man!
What has deceived you away from your Lord, the Most Beneficent?
The One Who created you, then moulded you, then made you proper?
He moulded you into whatever shape He willed.
Not at all – but rather you deny the establishment of Justice.
And indeed there are some guardians over you.
The honourable recorders.
Knowing all what you may do.
Indeed the virtuous are in serenity.
And indeed the sinners are in hell.
They will enter it on the Day of Justice.
And will not be able to hide from it.
And what do you know – of what sort is the Day of Justice!
Again, what do you know – of what sort is the Day of Justice!
The day on which no soul will have the authority over any other soul; and on that day, the entire command belongs to Allah.
Ruin is for the defrauders. (Those who measure less.)
Those who when they take the measure from others, take it in full!
Whereas when they give others after measuring or weighing, they give them less!
What! Do they not expect that they will be raised?
(To be raised) for a Great Day?
The day when everyone will stand before the Lord Of The Creation.
Indeed, the record of the disbelievers is in the lowest place, the Sijjeen.
And what do you know, how (wretched) the Sijjeen is!
The record is a sealed text.
Ruin is for the deniers on that day!
Those who deny the Day of Justice.
And none will deny it, except every transgressor, rebel.
When you recite Our verses to him, he says, “Stories of earlier men!”
Not at all – but rather their earnings have heaped rust upon their hearts.
Yes indeed – they will be deprived of seeing their Lord on that day.
Then indeed they have to enter hell.
It will then be said, “This is what you used to deny.”
Indeed the record of the virtuous is in the highest place, the Illiyin.
And what do you know what the Illiyoon are!
The record is a sealed text.
Which is witnessed by the close ones.
Indeed the virtuous are in serenity.
On thrones, watching.
You will recognise the freshness of serenity on their faces.
They will be given pure wine to drink, which is kept preserved, sealed.
Its seal is upon musk; and for this should those who crave be eager.
And it is mixed with Tasneem.
The spring from which drink the ones close to Allah.
Indeed the guilty used to laugh at the believers.
And when the believers used to pass by, they used to gesture at each other with their eyes.
And whilst returning to their homes, they used to return rejoicing.
And upon seeing the Muslims, they used to say, “Indeed they have gone astray.”
Whereas they have not at all been sent as guardians over them.
So this day it is the believers who laugh at the disbelievers.
On high thrones, watching.
Did not the disbelievers get repaid for what they used to do?
When the heaven breaks apart.
And it listens to the command of its Lord – and that befits it.
And when the earth is spread out.
And it unburdens itself of all that is in it, and becomes empty.
And it listens to the command of its Lord – and that befits it.
O man, indeed you have to surely run towards your Lord, and to meet him.
So whoever is given his record of deeds in his right hand –
Soon an easy account will be taken from him.
And he will return to his family rejoicing.
And whoever is given his record of deeds behind his back –
Soon he will pray for death.
And will go into the blazing fire.
Indeed he used to rejoice in his home.
He assumed that he does not have to return.
Surely yes, why not? Indeed his Lord is seeing him.
So by oath of the late evening’s light.
And by oath of the night and all that gathers in it.
And by oath of the moon when it is full.
You will surely go up level by level.
What is the matter with them that they do not accept faith?
And when the Qur’an is recited to them, they do not fall prostrate? (Command of Prostration # 13)
In fact the disbelievers keep denying.
And Allah well knows what they conceal in their hearts.
Therefore give them the glad tidings of a painful punishment.
Except those who believed and did good deeds – for them is a reward that will never end.
By oath of the heaven which contains the constellations.
And by oath of the Promised Day.
And by oath of the day that is a witness and by oath of a day in which the people present themselves.
Accursed be the People of the Ditch!
The people of the fuelled blazing fire.
When they were sitting at its edge.
And they themselves are witnesses to what they were doing to the Muslims!
And what did they dislike from the Muslims, except that the Muslims accepted faith in Allah the Most Honourable, the Most Praiseworthy?
To Him only belongs the kingship of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is a Witness over all things.
Indeed those who troubled the Muslim men and Muslim women, and then did not repent – for them is the punishment of hell, and for them is the punishment of fire.
Indeed those who believed and did good deeds – for them are Gardens beneath which rivers flow; this is the great success.
Indeed the seizure of your Lord is very severe.
Indeed it is He Who initiates and redoes.
And He only is the Oft Forgiving, the Beloved of His bondmen.
Master of the Honourable Throne.
Always doing whatever He wills.
Did the story of the armies reach you?
(The armies of) Firaun and the tribe of Thamud.
In fact the disbelievers are in denial.
And Allah is after them, has them surrounded.
In fact it (what they deny) is the Noble Qur’an.
In the Preserved Tablet.
By oath of the heaven, and by oath of the nightly arriver.
And have you understood what the nightly arriver is?
The very brightly shining star!
There is not a soul that does not have a guardian over it.
So man must consider from what he has been created.
Created from a gushing fluid.
That is issued from between the backs and the ribs.
Indeed Allah is Able to return him.
A day when the secrets will be examined.
So man will neither have any strength nor any aide.
By oath of the sky from which comes down the rain.
And by oath of the earth which flourishes with it.
Indeed the Qur’an is a decisive Word.
And is not a matter of amusement.
Indeed the disbelievers carry out their evil schemes.
And I secretly plan.
Therefore give them some respite – give them some time.
Proclaim the Purity of your Lord, the Supreme.
The One Who created, and then made proper.
And the One Who kept proper measure and then guided.
The One Who produced pasture.
Then made it dry and dark.
We shall now make you read (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), so you will not forget.
Except what Allah wills; indeed He knows all the evident and all the concealed.
And We shall create the means of ease for you.
Therefore advise, if advising is beneficial.
Soon whoever fears will heed advice.
And the most wicked will stay away from it.
The one who will enter the biggest fire.
Then he neither dies in it, nor lives.
Indeed successful is the one who became pure.
And who mentioned the name of his Lord, then offered prayer.
But rather you prefer the life of this world!
Whereas the Hereafter is better and everlasting.
Indeed this is in the former scriptures.
In the Books of Ibrahim and Moosa.
Certainly the news of the calamity that will overwhelm has come to you!
Many a face will be disgraced on that day.
Labouring, striving hard.
(Yet) Going into the blazing fire.
Made to drink water from the boiling hot spring.
There is no food for them except thorns of fire.
Which neither give strength nor satisfy the hunger.
Many a face will be in serenity on that day.
Rejoicing over their efforts.
In a high Garden.
In which they will not hear any lewd speech.
In it is a flowing spring.
In which are high thrones.
And chosen goblets.
And arranged carpets.
And linen spread out.
So do they not see the camel – how it has been created?
And the heaven – how it has been raised?
And the mountains – how they have been established?
And the earth – how it has been spread out?
Therefore advise; indeed you are a proclaimer of advice. (The Holy Prophet is a Remembrance from Allah.)
You are not at all a guardian over them.
Except whoever turns away and disbelieves –
So Allah will mete out to him the greatest punishment.
Indeed only towards Us is their return
Then indeed only upon Us is their reckoning.
By oath of the (particular) dawn.
And by oath of ten nights.
And by oath of the even and the odd.
And by oath of the night when it recedes
Why is there an oath in this, for the intelligent?
Did you not see how did your Lord deal with (the tribe of) Aad?
(And) the tall giants of Iram?
Like whom no one else was born in the cities.
And the tribe of Thamud, who hewed rocks in the valley.
And with Firaun, who used to crucify.
Those who rebelled in the cities,
And who then spread a lot of turmoil in them.
Therefore your Lord struck them hard with the means of punishment.
Indeed nothing is hidden from the sight of your Lord.
So man, whenever his Lord tests him by giving him honour and favours – thereupon he says, “My Lord has honoured me.”
And if He tests him and restricts his livelihood – thereupon he says, “My Lord has degraded me!”
Not at all – but rather you do not honour the orphan.
And do not urge one another to feed the needy.
And you readily devour the inheritance with greed.
And you harbour intense love for wealth.
Most certainly – when the earth is smashed and blown to bits.
And when the command of your Lord comes – and the angels row by row,
And when hell is brought that day – on that day will man reflect, but where is the time now to think?
He will say, “Alas – if only I had sent some good deeds ahead, during my lifetime!”
So on that day, no one punishes like He does!
And no one binds like He does!
O the contented soul!
Return towards your Lord – you being pleased with Him, and He pleased with you!
Then enter the ranks of My chosen bondmen!
And come into My Paradise!
I swear by this city (Mecca) –
For you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) are in this city.
And by oath of your forefather Ibrahim, and by you – his illustrious son!
We have indeed created man surrounded by hardships.
Does man think that no one will ever have power over him?
He says, “I destroyed vast wealth.”
Does man think that no one saw him?
Did We not make two eyes for him?
And a tongue and two lips?
And did We not guide him to the two elevated things?
So he did not quickly enter the steep valley.
And what have you understood, what the valley is!
The freeing of a slave!
Or the feeding on a day of hunger.
Of a related orphan,
Or of a homeless needy person!
And moreover to be of those who accepted faith, and who urged patience to one another and who urged graciousness to one another.
These are the people of the right.
And those who denied Our signs, are the people of the left.
Upon them is a fire, in which they are imprisoned, closed and shut above them.
By oath of the sun and its light
And by oath of the moon when it follows the sun
And by oath of the day when it reveals it
And by oath of the night when it hides it
And by oath of the heaven and by oath of Him Who made it.
And by oath of the earth and by oath of Him Who spread it.
And by oath of the soul and by oath of Him Who made it proper.
And inspired in it the knowledge of its sins and its piety.
Indeed successful is the one who made it pure.
And indeed failed is the one who covered it in sin.
The tribe of Thamud denied with rebellion.
When the most wicked among them stood up in defiance.
So the Noble Messenger of Allah said to them, “Stay away from the she camel of Allah, and from its turn to drink.”
In response they belied him, and hamstrung the she camel – so Allah put ruin over them because of their sins and flattened their dwellings.
And He does not fear its coming behind (to take vengeance).
By oath of the night when it covers
And by oath of the day when it shines
And by oath of the One Who created the male and the female.
Indeed your efforts differ.
So for one who gave and practised piety
And believed the best matter to be true
So We will very soon provide him ease.
And for him who hoarded wealth and remained carefree,
And denied the best matter,
So We will very soon provide him hardship.
His wealth will not avail him when he falls into ruin.
Indeed guiding is upon Us.
And indeed the Hereafter and this world both belong to Us.
I therefore warn you of the fire that is ablaze.
None except the most wicked will enter it.
The one who denied and turned away.
He will be far away from the most pious. (The first Caliph S. Abu Bakr Siddiq)
Who gives his wealth in order to be pure.
And no one has done a favour to him, for which he should be compensated.
He desires only to please his Lord, the Supreme.
And indeed, soon he will be very pleased.
By oath of the late morning,
And by oath of the night when it covers,
Your Lord has not forsaken you nor does He dislike you!
And indeed the latter is better for you than the former.
And indeed your Lord will soon give you so much that you will be pleased. (Allah seeks to please the Holy Prophet – peace and blessings be upon him.)
Did He not find you an orphan, so provided you shelter?
And found you deeply engrossed in His love, so directed you?
And found you in need, so made you prosperous?
Therefore do not oppress the orphan.
And do not rebuke the beggar.
And abundantly proclaim the favours of your Lord.
Did We not widen your bosom?
And relieve you of the burden –
Which had broken your back?
And We have exalted your remembrance for you.
So indeed with hardship is ease.
Indeed with hardship is ease.
So when you finish the prayer, strive in supplication.
And incline towards your Lord.
By oath of the fig and of the olive,
And by oath of Mount Sinai,
And by oath of this secure land,
We have indeed created man in the best shape.
We then turned him towards all the lowest of the low states.
Except those who accepted faith and did good deeds – for them is a never ending reward.
So after this, what causes you to deny the judgement?
Is not Allah the Greatest Judge upon all judges?
Read with the name of your Lord Who created,
Created man from a clot.
Read, and your Lord only is the Most Beneficent,
The One Who taught to write with the pen.
The One Who taught man all what he did not know.
Yes indeed, man is surely rebellious.
As he considers himself independent!
Indeed towards your Lord only is the return.
What is your opinion – regarding him who forbids –
A bondman when he offers the prayer?
What is your opinion – if he were upon guidance,
He would enjoin piety, so how good it would be!
What is your opinion – if he denies and turns away, how wretched will be his state!
Did he not realise that Allah is watching?
Yes certainly, if he does not desist, We will seize him by the forelock.
A forelock that lies, is sinful.
So let him now call his gang!
We will now call the guards!
Yes indeed; do not listen to him – and prostrate, and become close to Us. (Command of Prostration # 14)
We have indeed sent down the Qur’an in the Night of Destiny.
And what have you understood, what the Night of Destiny is!
The Night of Destiny is better than a thousand months.
In it descend the angels and Jibreel, by the command of their Lord – for all works.
It is peace until the rising of dawn.
The disbelieving People of the Book(s) and the polytheists would not have left their religion until the clear proof came to them.
(The clear proof is) the Noble Messenger from Allah, who reads the pure pages.
In which are written proper affairs.
Nor did the People of the Book(s) get divided until after the clear proof came to them.
And they were ordered only to worship Allah, believing purely in Him – devoted solely (to Him), and to establish the prayer and to pay the obligatory charity – and this is the straight religion.
Indeed all disbelievers, the People of the Book(s) and the polytheists, are in the fire of hell – they will remain in it for ever; it is they who are the worst among the creation.
Indeed those who accepted faith and did good deeds – it is they who are the best among the creation.
Their reward is – with their Lord – everlasting Gardens of Eden beneath which rivers flow, in which they will abide for ever and ever; Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him; this is for one who fears his Lord.
When the earth is shaken with its appointed tremor.
And the earth throws out its burdens.
And man says, “What has happened to it?”
On that day earth will narrate its news,
Because your Lord sent a command to it.
On that day men will return towards their Lord, in different groups, in order to be shown their deeds.
So whoever does a good deed equal to the weight of the minutest particle, will see it.
And whoever does an evil deed equal to the weight of the minutest particle, will see it.
By oath of those that sprint, breathing heavily. (The horses used in Holy War.)
Striking stones with their hooves, sparking fire.
And by oath of those who raid at dawn.
So thereupon raising dust.
Then penetrate to the centre of the enemy army.
Indeed man is very ungrateful towards his Lord.
And indeed he himself is a witness to it.
And indeed he loves wealth to the extreme.
So does he not know? When those in the graves are raised,
And all what lies in the breasts is opened –
On that day their Lord surely knows all about them!
The event that terrifies the hearts!
What is the event that terrifies the hearts?
And what have you understood, what the event that terrifies the hearts is!
The day when men will be like scattered moths.
And mountains will be like flying wool.
So for one whose scales prove heavy,
He is therefore in the desired bliss.
And for one whose scales prove light,
He is in the lap of one that abases.
And what have you understood, what the one that abases is!
A flaming fire!
The craving for excess wealth kept you people neglectful.
Until you confronted the graves.
Yes certainly, you will soon realise!
Again, yes certainly, you will soon realise!
Yes certainly, if you had believed with certainty, you would not have craved for wealth.
Indeed you will see hell.
Again, indeed you will see it with certainty.
Then, on that day, you will surely be questioned regarding the favours.
By oath of this era of yours (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him).
Indeed man is surely in a loss.
Except those who accepted faith, and did good deeds and urged one another to the truth – and urged one another to have patience.
Ruin is for every open slanderer, backbiter.
Who accumulated wealth and hoarded it, counting.
Does he think that his wealth will prolong his stay on earth forever?
Never!
He will certainly be thrown into the Crushing One.
And what have you understood what the Crushing One is!
The fire of Allah, that is ablaze.
Which will climb on to the hearts.
Indeed it will be shut over them.
In extended columns.
O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), did you not see how did your Lord deal with the People of the Elephant?
Did He not put their scheme into ruin?
And send flocks of birds upon them,
Which hit them with stones of baked clay,
So He made them like the leftover devoured leaves of farms?
Because of giving alliances to the Quraish.
(We) gave them alliances during both their travels of winter and summer.
So they must worship the Lord of this House. (The Ka’aba)
The One Who gave them food in hunger, and bestowed them safety from a great fear.
Just look at him, who belies the religion!
So it is he, who pushes away the orphan,
And does not urge to feed the needy.
So ruin is to those offerers of prayer –
Those who are neglectful of their prayer.
Those who make a display (of their deeds).
And do not let others ask for small utilities.
We have indeed bestowed the Kausar* upon you (O dear prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him). (*Infinite excellent qualities / the greatest number of followers / the sweet pond on the Day of Resurrection)
So offer the prayers for your Lord, and perform the sacrifice.
Indeed it is your enemy who is bereft of all goodness.
Proclaim, (O dear prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “O disbelievers!”
Neither do I worship what you worship.
Nor do you worship Whom I worship.
And neither will I ever worship what you worship.
Nor will you worship Whom I worship.
For you is your religion, and for me is mine.
When the help and victory of Allah come,
And you see people entering the religion of Allah in multitudes,
Then proclaim the Purity of your Lord while praising Him, and seek forgiveness from Him; indeed He is the Most Acceptor of Repentance.
May both the hands of Abu Lahab be destroyed – and they are destroyed!
His wealth did not benefit him in the least, nor did whatever he earned.
He will soon enter the flaming fire.
And so will his wife; carrying a bundle of firewood on her head.
A rope made from palm fibre around her neck!
Proclaim (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “He is Allah, He is One.”
“Allah is the Un-wanting.” (Perfect, does not require anything.)
“He has no offspring, nor is He born from anything.”
“And there is none equal to Him.”
Proclaim (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “I take refuge of the One Who creates the Daybreak.”
“From the evil of His entire creation.”
“And from the evil of the matter that darkens when it sets.”
“And from the evil of the witches who blow into knots.”
“And from the evil of the envier when he is envious of me.”
Proclaim (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “I take refuge of the One Who is the Lord of all mankind.”
“The King of all mankind.”
“The God of all mankind.”
“From the evil of the one who instils evil thoughts in the hearts – and stays hidden.”
“Those who instil evil thoughts into the hearts of men.”
“Among the jinns and men.”
In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate
Praise belongs to God, the Lord of all Being,
the All-merciful, the All-compassionate,
the Master of the Day of Doom.
Thee only we serve; to Thee alone we pray for succour.
Guide us in the straight path,
the path of those whom Thou hast blessed, not of those against whom Thou art wrathful, nor of those who are astray.
Alif Lam Mim
That is the Book, wherein is no doubt, a guidance to the godfearing
who believe in the Unseen, and perform the prayer, and expend of that We have provided them;
who believe in what has been sent down to thee and what has been sent down before thee, and have faith in the Hereafter;
those are upon guidance from their Lord, those are the ones who prosper.
As for the unbelievers, alike it is to them whether thou hast warned them or hast not warned them, they do not believe.
God has set a seal on their hearts and on their hearing, and on their eyes is a covering, and there awaits them a mighty chastisement.
And some men there are who say, 'We believe in God and the Last Day'; but they are not believers.
They would trick God and the believers, and only themselves they deceive, and they are not aware.
In their hearts is a sickness, and God has increased their sickness, and there awaits them a painful chastisement for that they have cried lies.
When it is said to them, 'Do not corruption in the land', they say, 'We are only ones that put things right.'
Truly, they are the workers of corruption but they are not aware.
When it is said to them, 'Believe as the people believe', they say, 'Shall we believe, as fools believe?'
Truly, they are the foolish ones, but they do not know.
When they meet those who believe, they say, 'We believe'; but when they go privily to their Satans, they say, 'We are with you; we were only mocking.'
God shall mock them, and shall lead them on blindly wandering in their insolence.
Those are they that have bought error at the price of guidance, and their commerce has not profited them, and they are not right-guided.
The likeness of them is as the likeness of a man who kindled a fire, and when it lit all about him God took away their light, and left them in darkness unseeing
deaf, dumb, blind -- so they shall not return;
or as a cloudburst out of heaven in which is darkness, and thunder, and lightning -- they put their fingers in their ears against the thunderclaps, fearful of death; and God encompasses the unbelievers;
the lightning wellnigh snatches away their sight; whensoever it gives them light, they walk in it, and when the darkness is over them, they halt; had God willed, He would have taken away their hearing and their sight.
Truly, God is powerful over everything.
O you men, serve your Lord Who created you, and those that were before you; haply so you will be godfearing;
who assigned to you the earth for a couch, and heaven for an edifice, and sent down out of heaven water, wherewith He brought forth fruits for your provision; so set not up compeers to God wittingly.
And if you are in doubt concerning that We have sent down on Our servant, then bring a sura like it, and call your witnesses, apart from God, if you are truthful.
And if you do not -- and you will not -- then fear the Fire, whose fuel is men and stones, prepared for unbelievers.
Give thou good tidings to those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, that for them await gardens underneath which rivers flow; whensoever they are provided with fruits therefrom they shall say, 'This is that wherewithal we were provided before'; that they shall be given in perfect semblance; and there for them shall be spouses purified; therein they shall dwell forever.
God is not ashamed to strike a similitude even of a gnat, or aught above it.
As for the believers, they know it is the truth from their Lord; but as for unbelievers, they say, 'What did God desire by this for a similitude?'
Thereby He leads many astray, and thereby He guides many; and thereby He leads none astray save the ungodly
such as break the covenant of God after its solemn binding, and such as cut what God has commanded should be joined, and such as do corruption in the land -- they shall be the losers.
How do you disbelieve in God, seeing you were dead and He gave you life, then He shall make you dead, then He shall give you life, then unto Him you shall be returned?
It is He who created for you all that is in the earth, then He lifted Himself to heaven and levelled them seven heavens; and He has knowledge of everything.
And when thy Lord said to the angels, 'I am setting in the earth a viceroy.' They said, 'What, wilt Thou set therein one who will do corruption there, and shed blood, while We proclaim Thy praise and call Thee Holy?'
He said, 'Assuredly I know that you know not.'
And He taught Adam the names, all of them; then He presented them unto the angels and said, 'Now tell Me the names of these, if you speak truly.'
They said, 'Glory be to Thee!
We know not save what Thou hast taught us. Surely Thou art the All-knowing, the All-wise.'
He said, 'Adam, tell them their names.'
And when he had told them their names He said, 'Did I not tell you I know the unseen things of the heavens and earth? And I know what things you reveal, and what you were hiding.'
And when We said to the angels, 'Bow yourselves to Adam'; so they bowed themselves, save Iblis; he refused, and waxed proud, and so he became one of the unbelievers.
And We said, 'Adam, dwell thou, and thy wife, in the Garden, and eat thereof easefully where you desire; but draw not nigh this tree, lest you be evildoers.'
Then Satan caused them to slip therefrom and brought them out of that they were in; and We said, 'Get you all down, each of you an enemy of each; and in the earth a sojourn shall be yours, and enjoyment for a time.'
Thereafter Adam received certain words from his Lord, and He turned towards him; truly He turns, and is All-compassionate.
We said, 'Get you down out of it, all together; yet there shall come to you guidance from Me, and whosoever follows My guidance, no fear shall be on them, neither shall they sorrow.
As for the unbelievers who cry lies to Our signs, those shall be the inhabitants of the Fire, therein dwelling forever.'
Children of Israel, remember My blessing wherewith I blessed you, and fulfil My covenant and I shall fulfil your covenant; and have awe of Me.
And believe in that I have sent down, confirming that which is with you, and be not the first to disbelieve in it.
And sell not My signs for a little price; and fear you Me.
And do not confound the truth with vanity, and do not conceal the truth wittingly.
And perform the prayer, and pay the alms, and bow with those that bow.
Will you bid others to piety, and forget yourselves while you recite the Book?
Do you not understand?
Seek you help in patience and prayer, for grievous it is, save to the humble
who reckon that they shall meet their Lord and that unto Him they are returning.
Children of Israel, remember My blessing wherewith I blessed you, and that I have preferred you above all beings;
and beware of a day when no soul for another shall give satisfaction, and no intercession shall be accepted from it, nor any counterpoise be taken, neither shall they be helped.
And when We delivered you from the folk of Pharaoh who were visiting you with evil chastisement, slaughtering your sons, and sparing your women; and in that was a grievous trial from your Lord.
And when We divided for you the sea and delivered you, and drowned Pharaoh's folk while you were beholding.
And when We appointed with Moses forty nights then you took to yourselves the Calf after him and you were evildoers;
then We pardoned you after that, that haply you should be thankful.
And when We gave to Moses the Book and the Salvation, that haply you should be guided.
And when Moses said to his people, 'My people, you have done wrong against yourselves by your taking the Calf; now turn to your Creator and slay one another.
That will be better for you in your Creator's sight, and He will turn to you; truly He turns, and is All-compassionate.'
And when you said, 'Moses, we will not believe thee till we see God openly'; and the thunderbolt took you while you were beholding.
Then We raised you up after you were dead, that haply you should be thankful.
And We outspread the cloud to overshadow you, and We sent down manna and quails upon you: 'Eat of the good things wherewith We have provided you. And they worked no wrong upon Us, but themselves they wronged.
And when We said, 'Enter this township, and eat easefully of it wherever you will, and enter in at the gate, prostrating, and say, Unburdening; We will forgive you your transgressions, and increase the good-doers.'
Then the evildoers substituted a saying other than that which had been said to them; so We sent down upon the evildoers wrath out of heaven for their ungodliness.
And when Moses sought water for his people, so We said, 'Strike with thy staff the rock'; and there gushed forth from it twelve fountains; all the people knew now their drinking-place.
'Eat and drink of God's providing, and mischief not in the earth, doing corruption.'
And when you said, 'Moses, we will not endure one sort of food; pray to thy Lord for us, that He may bring forth for us of that the earth produces - green herbs, cucumbers, corn, lentils, onions.' He said, 'Would you have in exchange what is meaner for what is better?
Get you down to Egypt; you shall have there that you demanded.'
And abasement and poverty were pitched upon them, and they were laden with the burden of God's anger; that, because they had disbelieved the signs of God and slain the Prophets unrightfully; that, because they disobeyed, and were transgressors.
Surely they that believe, and those of Jewry, and the Christians, and those Sabaeans, whoso believes in God and the Last Day, and works righteousness -- their wage awaits them with their Lord, and no fear shall be on them; neither shall they sorrow.
And when We took compact with you, and raised above you the Mount: 'Take forcefully what We have given you, and remember what is in it; haply you shall be godfearing.'
Then you turned away thereafter, and but for the bounty and mercy of God towards you, you had been of the losers.
And well you know there were those among you that transgressed the Sabbath, and We said to them, 'Be you apes, miserably slinking!'
And We made it a punishment exemplary for all the former times and for the latter, and an admonition to such as are godfearing.
And when Moses said to his people, 'God commands you to sacrifice a cow.' They said, 'Dost thou take us in mockery?'
He said, 'I take refuge with God, lest I should be one of the ignorant.'
They said, 'Pray to thy Lord for us, that He may make clear to us what she may be.'
He said, 'He says she is a cow neither old, nor virgin, middling between the two; so do that you are bidden.'
They said, 'Pray to thy Lord for us, that He make clear to us what her colour may be.'
He said, 'He says she shall be a golden cow, bright her colour, gladdening the beholders.'
They said, 'Pray to thy Lord for us, that He make clear to us what she may be; cows are much alike to us; and, if God will, we shall then be guided.'
He said, 'He says she shall be a cow not broken to plough the earth or to water the tillage, one kept secure, with no blemish on her.'
They said, 'Now thou hast brought the truth'; and therefore they sacrificed her, a thing they had scarcely done.
And when you killed a living soul, and disputed thereon -- and God disclosed what you were hiding --
so We said, 'Smite him with part of it'; even so God brings to life the dead, and He shows you His signs, that haply you may have understanding.
Then your hearts became hardened thereafter and are like stones, or even yet harder; for there are stones from which rivers come gushing, and others split, so that water issues from them, and others crash down in the fear of God.
And God is not heedless of the things you do.
Are you then so eager that they should believe you, seeing there is a party of them that heard God's word, and then tampered with it, and that after they had comprehended it, wittingly?
And when they meet those who believe, they say 'We believe'; and when they go privily one to another, they say, 'Do you speak to them of what God has revealed to you, that they may thereby dispute with you before your Lord?
Have you no understanding?'
Know they not that God knows what they keep secret and what they publish?
And some there are of them that are common folk not knowing the Book, but only fancies and mere conjectures.
So woe to those who write the Book with their hands, then say, 'This is from God,' that they may sell it for a little price; so woe to them for what their hands have written, and woe to them for their earnings.
And they say, 'The Fire shall not touch us save a number of days.'
Say: 'Have you taken with God a covenant?
God will not fail in His covenant; or say you things against God of which you know nothing?
Not so; whoso earns evil, and is encompassed by his transgression -- those are the inhabitants of the Fire; there they shall dwell forever.
And those that believe, and do deeds of righteousness -- those are the inhabitants of Paradise; there they shall dwell forever.'
And when We took compact with the Children of Israel: 'You shall not serve any save God; and to be good to parents, and the near kinsman, and to orphans, and to the needy; and speak good to men, and perform the prayer, and pay the alms.' Then you turned away, all but a few of you, swerving aside.
And when We took compact with you: 'You shall not shed your own blood, neither expel your own from your habitations'; then you confirmed it and yourselves bore witness.
Then there you are killing one another, and expelling a party of you from their habitations, conspiring against them in sin and enmity; and if they come to you as captives, you ransom them; yet their expulsion was forbidden you.
What, do you believe in part of the Book, and disbelieve in part?
What shall be the recompense of those of you who do that, but degradation in the present life, and on the Day of Resurrection to be returned unto the most terrible of chastisement?
And God is not heedless of the things you do.
Those who have purchased the present life at the price of the world to come -- for them the chastisement shall not be lightened, neither shall they be helped.
And We gave to Moses the Book, and after him sent succeeding Messengers; and We gave Jesus son of Mary the clear signs, and confirmed him with the Holy Spirit; and whensoever there came to you a Messenger with that your souls had not desire for, did you become arrogant, and some cry lies to, and some slay?
And they say, 'Our hearts are uncircumcised.'
Nay, but God has cursed them for their unbelief; little will they believe.
When there came to them a Book from God, confirming what was with them -- and they aforetimes prayed for victory over the unbelievers -- when there came to them that they recognized, they disbelieved in it; and the curse of God is on the unbelievers.
Evil is the thing they have sold themselves for, disbelieving in that which God sent down, grudging that God should send down of His bounty on whomsoever He will of His servants, and they were laden with anger upon anger; and for unbelievers awaits a humbling chastisement.
And when they were told, 'Believe in that God has sent down,' they said, 'We believe in what was sent down on us'; and they disbelieve in what is beyond that, yet it is the truth confirming what is with them.
Say: 'Why then were you slaying the Prophets of God in former time, if you were believers?'
And Moses came to you with the clear signs, then you took to yourselves the Calf after him and you were evildoers.
And when We took compact with you, and raised over you the Mount: 'Take forcefully what We have given you and give ear.'
They said, 'We hear, and rebel'; and they were made to drink the Calf in their hearts for their unbelief.
Say: 'Evil is the thing your faith bids you to, if you are believers.'
Say: 'If the Last Abode with God is yours exclusively, and not for other people, then long for death -- if you speak truly.'
But they will never long for it, because of that their hands have forwarded; God knows the evildoers;
and thou shalt find them the eagerest of men for life.
And of the idolaters; there is one of them wishes if he might be spared a thousand years, yet his being spared alive shall not remove him from the chastisement.
God sees the things they do.
Say: 'Whosoever is an enemy to Gabriel -- he it was that brought it down upon thy heart by the leave of God, confirming what was before it, and for a guidance and good tidings to the believers.
Whosoever is an enemy to God and His angels and His Messengers, and Gabriel, and Michael - surely God is an enemy to the unbelievers.'
And We have sent down unto thee signs, clear signs, and none disbelieves in them except the ungodly.
Why, whensoever they have made a covenant, does a party of them reject it?
Nay, but the most of them are unbelievers.
When there has come to them a Messenger from God confirming what was with them, a party of them that were given the Book reject the Book of God behind their backs, as though they knew not,
and they follow what the Satans recited over Solomon's kingdom. Solomon disbelieved not, but the Satans disbelieved, teaching the people sorcery, and that which was sent down upon Babylon's two angels, Harut and Marut; they taught not any man, without they said, 'We are but a temptation; do not disbelieve.' From them they learned how they might divide a man and his wife, yet they did not hurt any man thereby, save by the leave of God, and they learned what hurt them, and did not profit them, knowing well that whoso buys it shall have no share in the world to come; evil then was that they sold themselves for, if they had but known.
Yet had they believed, and been godfearing, a recompense from God had been better, if they had but known.
O believers, do not say, 'Observe us,' but say, 'Regard us'; and give ear; for unbelievers awaits a painful chastisement.
Those unbelievers of the People of the Book and the idolaters wish not that any good should be sent down upon you from your Lord; but God singles out for His mercy whom He will; God is of bounty abounding.
And for whatever verse We abrogate or cast into oblivion, We bring a better or the like of it; knowest thou not that God is powerful over everything?
Knowest thou not that to God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and that you have none, apart from God, neither protector nor helper?
Or do you desire to question your Messenger as Moses was questioned in former time?
Whoso exchanges belief for unbelief has surely strayed from the right way.
Many of the People of the Book wish they might restore you as unbelievers, after you have believed, in the jealousy of their souls, after the truth has become clear to them; yet do you pardon and be forgiving, till God brings His command; truly God is powerful over everything.
And perform the prayer, and pay the alms; whatever good you shall forward to your souls' account, you shall find it with God; assuredly God sees the things you do.
And they say, 'None shall enter Paradise except that they be Jews or Christians.'
Such are their fancies.
Say: 'Produce your proof, if you speak truly.'
Nay, but whosoever submits his will to God, being a good-doer, his wage is with his Lord, and no fear shall be on them, neither shall they sorrow.
The Jews say, 'The Christians stand not on anything'; the Christians say, 'The Jews stand not on anything'; yet they recite the Book.
So too the ignorant say the like of them.
God shall decide between them on the Day of Resurrection touching their differences.
And who does greater evil than he who bars God's places of worship, so that His Name be not rehearsed in them, and strives to destroy them?
Such men might never enter them, save in fear; for them is degradation in the present world, and in the world to come a mighty chastisement.
To God belong the East and the West; whithersoever you turn, there is the Face of God; God is All-embracing, All-knowing.
And they say, 'God has taken to Him a son.
Glory be to Him!
Nay, to Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth; all obey His will --
the Creator of the heavens and the earth; and when He decrees a thing, He but says to it 'Be,' and it is.
And they that know not say, 'Why does God not speak to us? Why does a sign not come to us?'
So spoke those before them as these men say; their hearts are much alike.
Yet We have made clear the signs unto a people who are sure
We have sent thee with the truth, good tidings to bear, and warning. Thou shalt not be questioned touching the inhabitants of Hell.
Never will the Jews be satisfied with thee, neither the Christians, not till thou followest their religion.
Say: 'God's guidance is the true guidance.'
If thou followest their caprices, after the knowledge that has come to thee, thou shalt have against God neither protector nor helper.
Those to whom We have given the Book and who recite it with true recitation, they believe in it; and whoso disbelieves in it, they shall be the losers.
Children of Israel, remember My blessing wherewith I blessed you, and that I have preferred you above all beings;
and beware a day when no soul for another shall give satisfaction, and no counterpoise shall be accepted from it, nor any intercession shall be profitable to it, neither shall they be helped.
And when his Lord tested Abraham with certain words, and he fulfilled them. He said, 'Behold, I make you a leader for the people.'
Said he, 'And of my seed?'
He said 'My covenant shall not reach the evildoers.'
And when We appointed the House to be a place of visitation for the people, and a sanctuary, and: 'Take to yourselves Abraham's station for a place of prayer.'
And We made covenant with Abraham and Ishmael: 'Purify My House for those that shall go about it and those that cleave to it, to those who bow and prostrate themselves.'
And when Abraham said, 'My Lord, make this a land secure, and provide its people with fruits, such of them as believe in God and the Last Day.' He said, 'And whoso disbelieves, to him I shall give enjoyment a little, then I shall compel him to the chastisement of the Fire -- how evil a homecoming!'
And when Abraham, and Ishmael with him, raised up the foundations of the House: 'Our Lord, receive this from us; Thou art the All-hearing, the All-knowing;
and, our Lord, make us submissive to Thee, and of our seed a nation submissive to Thee; and show us our holy rites, and turn towards us; surely Thou turnest, and art All-compassionate;
and, our Lord, do Thou send among them a Messenger, one of them, who shall recite to them Thy signs, and teach them the Book and the Wisdom, and purify them; Thou art the All-mighty, the All-wise.'
Who therefore shrinks from the religion of Abraham, except he be foolish-minded?
Indeed, We chose him in the present world, and in the world to come he shall be among the righteous.
When his Lord said to him, 'Surrender,' he said, 'I have surrendered me to the Lord of all Being.'
And Abraham charged his sons with this and Jacob likewise: 'My sons, God has chosen for you the religion; see that you die not save in surrender.'
When he said to his sons, 'What will you serve after me?' They said, 'We will serve thy God and the God of thy fathers Abraham, Ishmael and Isaac, One God; to Him we surrender.'
That is a nation that has passed away; there awaits them that they have earned, and there awaits you that you have earned; you shall not be questioned concerning the things they did.
And they say, 'Be Jews or Christians and you shall be guided.'
Say thou: 'Nay, rather the creed of Abraham, a man of pure faith; he was no idolater.'
Say you: 'We believe in God, and in that which has been sent down on us and sent down on Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac and Jacob, and the Tribes, and that which was given to Moses and Jesus and the Prophets, of their Lord; we make no division between any of them, and to Him we surrender.'
And if they believe in the like of that you believe in, then they are truly guided; but if they turn away, then they are clearly in schism; God will suffice you for them; He is the All-hearing, the All-knowing;
the baptism of God; and who is there that baptizes fairer than God?
Him we are serving.
Say: 'Would you then dispute with us concerning God, who is our Lord and your Lord?
Our deeds belong to us, and to you belong your deeds; Him we serve sincerely.
Or do you say, "Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac and Jacob, and the Tribes -- they were Jews, or they were Christians"?'
Say: 'Have you then greater knowledge, or God?
And who does greater evil than he who conceals a testimony received from God?
And God is not heedless of the things you do.'
That is a nation that has passed away; there awaits them that they have earned, and there awaits you that you have earned; you shall not be questioned concerning the things they did.
The fools among the people will say, 'What has turned them from the direction they were facing in their prayers aforetime?'
Say: "To God belong the East and the West; He guides whomsoever He will to a straight path.'
Thus We appointed you a midmost nation that you might be witnesses to the people, and that the Messenger might be a witness to you; and We did not appoint the direction thou wast facing, except that We might know who followed the Messenger from him who turned on his heels -- though it were a grave thing save for those whom God has guided; but God would never leave your faith to waste - truly, God is All-gentle with the people, All-compassionate.
We have seen thee turning thy face about in the heaven; now We will surely turn thee to a direction that shall satisfy thee.
Turn thy face towards the Holy Mosque; and wherever you are, turn your faces towards it.
Those who have been given the Book know it is the truth from their Lord; God is not heedless of the things they do.
Yet if thou shouldst bring to those that have been given the Book every sign, they will not follow thy direction; thou art not a follower of their direction, neither are they followers of one another's direction.
If thou followest their caprices, after the knowledge that has come to thee, then thou wilt surely be among the evildoers
whom We have given the Book, and they recognize as they recognize their sons, even though there is a party of them conceal the truth and that wittingly.
The truth comes from thy Lord; then be not among the doubters.
Every man has his direction to which he turns; so be you forward in good works.
Wherever you may be, God will bring you all together; surely God is powerful over everything.
From whatsoever place thou issuest, turn thy face towards the Holy Mosque; it is the truth from thy Lord.
God is not heedless of the things you do.
From whatsoever place thou issuest, turn thy face towards the Holy Mosque; and wherever you may be, turn your faces towards it, that the people may not have any argument against you, excepting the evildoers of them; and fear you them not, but fear you Me; and that I may perfect My blessing upon you, and that haply so you may be guided;
as also We have sent among you, of yourselves, a Messenger, to recite Our signs to you and to purify you, and to teach you the Book and the Wisdom, and to teach you that you knew not.
So remember Me, and I will remember you; and be thankful to Me; and be you not ungrateful towards Me.
O all you who believe, seek you help in patience and prayer; surely God is with the patient.
And say not of those slain in God's way, 'They are dead'; rather they are living, but you are not aware.
Surely We will try you with something of fear and hunger, and diminution of goods and lives and fruits; yet give thou good tidings unto the patient
who, when they are visited by an affliction, say, 'Surely we belong to God, and to Him we return';
upon those rest blessings and mercy from their Lord, and those -- they are the truly guided.
Safa and Marwa are among the waymarks of God; so whosoever makes the Pilgrimage to the House, or the Visitation, it is no fault in him to circumambulate them; and whoso volunteers good, God is All-grateful, All-knowing
Those who conceal the clear signs and the guidance that We have sent down, after We have shown them clearly in the Book -- they shall be cursed by God and the cursers,
save such as repent and make amends, and show clearly -- towards them I shall turn; I turn, All-compassionate.
But those who disbelieve, and die disbelieving -- upon them shall rest the curse of God and the angels, and of men altogether,
therein dwelling forever; the chastisement shall not be lightened for them; no respite shall be given them.
Your God is One God; there is no god but He, the All-merciful, the All-compassionate.
.. Surely in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of night and day and the ship that runs in the sea with profit to men, and the water God sends down from heaven therewith reviving the earth after it is dead and His scattering abroad in it all manner of crawling thing, and the turning about of the winds and the clouds compelled between heaven and earth -- surely there are signs for a people having understanding.
Yet there be men who take to themselves compeers apart from God, loving them as God is loved; but those that believe love God more ardently.
O if the evildoers might see, when they see the chastisement, that the power altogether belongs to God, and that God is terrible in chastisement,
when those that were followed disown their followers, and they see the chastisement, and their cords are cut asunder,
and those that followed say, 'O if only we might return again and disown them, as they have disowned us!' Even so God shall show them their works.
O bitter regrets for them! Never shall they issue from the Fire.
O men, eat of what is in the earth lawful and good; and follow not the steps of Satan; he is a manifest foe to you.
He only commands you to evil and indecency, and that you should speak against God such things as you know not.
And when it is said to them, 'Follow what God has sent down,' they say, 'No; but we will follow such things as we found our fathers doing.' What?
The likeness of those who disbelieve is as the likeness of one who shouts to that which hears nothing, save a call and a cry; deaf, dumb, blind -- they do not understand.
O believers, eat of the good things wherewith We have provided you, and give thanks to God, if it be Him that you serve.
These things only has He forbidden you: carrion, blood, the flesh of swine, what has been hollowed to other than God.
Yet who so is constrained, not desiring nor transgressing, no sin shall be on him; God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
Those who conceal what of the Book God has sent down on them, and sell it for a little price - they shall eat naught but the Fire in their bellies; God shall not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection neither purify them; there awaits them a painful chastisement.
Those are they that have bought error at the price of guidance, and chastisement at the price of pardon; how patiently they shall endure the Fire!
That, because God has sent down the Book with the truth; and those that are at variance regarding the Book are in wide schism.
It is not piety, that you turn your faces to the East and to the West. True piety is this: to believe in God, and the Last Day, the angels, the Book, and the Prophets, to give of one's substance, however cherished, to kinsmen, and orphans, the needy, the traveller, beggars, and to ransom the slave, to perform the prayer, to pay the alms.
And they who fulfil their covenant when they have engaged in a covenant, and endure with fortitude misfortune, hardship and peril, these are they who are true in their faith, these are the truly godfearing.
O believers, prescribed for you is retaliation, touching the slain; freeman for freeman, slave for slave, female for female.
But if aught is pardoned a man by his brother, let the pursuing be honourable, and let the payment be with kindliness.
That is a lightening granted you by your Lord, and a mercy; and for him who commits aggression after that -- for him there awaits a painful chastisement.
In retaliation there is life for you, men possessed of minds; haply you will be godfearing.
Prescribed for you, when any of you is visited by death, and he leaves behind some goods, is to make testament in favour of his parents and kinsmen honourably -- an obligation on the godfearing.
Then if any man changes it after hearing it, the sin shall rest upon those who change it; surely God is All-hearing, All-knowing.
But if any man fears injustice or sin from one making testament, and so makes things right between them, then sin shall not rest upon him; surely God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
O believers, prescribed for you is the Fast, even as it was prescribed for those that were before you -- haply you will be godfearing --
for days numbered; and if any of you be sick, or if he be on a journey, then a number of other days; and for those who are able to fast, a redemption by feeding a poor man.
Yet better it is for him who volunteers good, and that you should fast is better for you, if you but know;
the month of Ramadan, wherein the Koran was sent down to be a guidance to the people, and as clear signs of the Guidance and the Salvation.
So let those of you, who are present at the month, fast it; and if any of you be sick, or if he be on a journey, then a number of other days; God desires ease for you, and desires not hardship for you; and that you fulfil the number, and magnify God that He has guided you, and haply you will be thankful.
And when My servants question thee concerning Me -- I am near to answer the call of the caller, when he calls to Me; so let them respond to Me, and let them believe in Me; haply so they will go aright.
Permitted to you, upon the night of the Fast, is to go in to your wives; -- they are a vestment for you, and you are a vestment for them.
God knows that you have been betraying yourselves, and has turned to you and pardoned you.
So now lie with them, and seek what God has prescribed for you.
And eat and drink, until the white thread shows clearly to you from the black thread at the dawn; then complete the Fast unto the night, and do not lie with them while you cleave to the mosques.
Those are God's bounds; keep well within them.
So God makes clear His signs to men; haply they will be godfearing.
Consume not your goods between you in vanity; neither proffer it to the judges, that you may sinfully consume a portion of other men's goods, and that wittingly.
They will question thee concerning the new moons.
Say: 'They are appointed times for the people, and the Pilgrimage.'
It is not piety to come to the houses from the backs of them; but piety is to be godfearing; so come to the houses by their doors, and fear God; haply so you will prosper.
And fight in the way of God with those; who fight with you, but aggress not: God loves not the aggressors.
And slay them wherever you come upon them, and expel them from where they expelled you; persecution is more grievous than slaying.
But fight them not by the Holy Mosque until they should fight you there; then, if they fight you, slay them -- such is the recompense of unbelievers --
but if they give over, surely God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
Fight them, till there is no persecution and the religion is God's; then if they give over, there shall be no enmity save for evildoers.
The holy month for the holy month; holy things demand retaliation. Whoso commits aggression against you, do you commit aggression against him like as he has committed against you, and fear you God, and know that God is with the godfearing.
And expend in the way of God; and cast not yourselves by your own hands into destruction, but be good-doers; God loves the good-doers.
Fulfil the Pilgrimage and the Visitation unto God; but if you are prevented, then such offering as may be feasible.
And shave not your heads, till the offering reaches its place of sacrifice.
If any of you is sick, or injured in his head, then redemption by fast, or freewill offering, or ritual sacrifice.
When you are secure, then whosoever enjoys the Visitation until the Pilgrimage, let his offering be such as may be feasible; or if he finds none, then a fast of three days in the Pilgrimage, and of seven when you return, that is ten completely; that is for him whose family are not present at the Holy Mosque.
And fear God, and know that God is terrible in retribution.
The Pilgrimage is in months well-known; whoso undertakes the duty of Pilgrimage in them shall not go in to his womenfolk nor indulge in ungodliness and disputing in the Pilgrimage.
Whatever good you do, God knows it.
And take provision; but the best provision is godfearing, so fear you Me, men possessed of minds!
It is no fault in you, that you should seek bounty from your Lord; but when you press on from Arafat, then remember God at the Holy Waymark, and remember Him as He has guided you, though formerly you were gone astray.
Then press on from where the people press on, and pray for God's forgiveness; God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
And when you have performed your holy rites remember God, as you remember your fathers or yet more devoutly.
Now some men there are who say, 'Our Lord, give to us in this world'; such men shall have no part in the world to come.
And others there are who say, 'Our Lord, give to us in this world good, and good in the world to come, and guard us against the chastisement of the fire';
those -- they shall have a portion from what they have earned; and God is swift at the reckoning.
And remember God during certain days numbered. If any man hastens on in two days, that is no sin in him; and if any delays, it is not a sin in him, if he be godfearing.
And fear you God, and know that unto Him you shall be mustered.
And some men there are whose saying upon the present world pleases thee, and such a one calls on God to witness what is in his heart, yet he is most stubborn in altercation,
and when he turns his back, he hastens about the earth, to do corruption there and to destroy the tillage and the stock; and God loves not corruption;
and when it is said to him, 'Fear God', vainglory seizes him in his sin.
So Gehenna shall be enough for him -- how evil a cradling!
But other men there are that sell themselves desiring God's good pleasure; and God is gentle with His servants.
O believers, enter the peace, all of you, and follow not the steps of Satan; he is a manifest foe to you.
But if you slip, after the clear signs have come to you, know then that God is All-mighty, All-wise.
What do they look for, but that God shall come to them in the cloud -- shadows, and the angels?
The matter is determined, and unto God all matters are returned.
Ask the Children of Israel how many a clear sign We gave them.
Whoso changes God's blessing after it has come to him, God is terrible in retribution.
Decked out fair to the unbelievers is the present life, and they deride the believers; but those who were godfearing shall be above them on the Resurrection Day; and God provides whomsoever He will without reckoning.
The people were one nation; then God sent forth the Prophets, good tidings to bear and warning, and He sent down with them the Book with the truth, that He might decide between the people touching their differences; and only those who had been given it were at variance upon it, after the clear signs had come to them, being insolent one to another; then God guided those who believed to the truth, touching which they were at variance, by His leave; and God guides whomsoever He will to a straight path.
Or did you suppose you should enter Paradise without there had come upon you the like of those who passed away before you?
They were afflicted by misery and hardship and were so convulsed, that the Messenger and those who believed with him said, 'When comes God's help?'
Ah, but surely God's help is nigh.
They will question thee concerning what they should expend.
Say: 'Whatsoever good you expend is for parents and kinsmen, orphans, the needy, and the traveller; and whatever good you may do, God has knowledge of it.'
Prescribed for you is fighting, though it be hateful to you.
Yet it may happen that you will hate a thing which is better for you; and it may happen that you will love a thing which is worse for you; God knows, and you know not.
They will question thee concerning the holy month, and fighting in it. Say: 'Fighting in it is a heinous thing, but to bar from God's way, and disbelief in Him, and the Holy Mosque, and to expel its people from it -- that is more heinous in God's sight; and persecution is more heinous than slaying.' They will not cease to fight with you, till they turn you from your religion, if they are able; and whosoever of you turns from his religion, and dies disbelieving -- their works have failed in this world and the next; those are the inhabitants of the Fire; therein they shall dwell forever.
But the believers, and those who emigrate and struggle in God's way -- those have hope of God's compassion; and God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
They will question thee concerning wine, and arrow-shuffling.
Say: 'In both is heinous sin; and uses for men, but the sin in them is more heinous than the usefulness.'
They will question thee concerning what they should expend.
Say: 'The abundance.'
So God makes clear His signs to you; haply you will reflect;
in this world, and the world to come.
They will question thee concerning the orphans.
Say: 'To set their affairs aright is good.
And if you intermix with them, they are your brothers.
God knows well him who works corruption from him who sets aright; and had He willed He would have harassed you.
Surely God is All-mighty, All-wise.'
Do not marry idolatresses, until they believe; a believing slavegirl is better than an idolatress, though you may admire her.
And do not marry idolaters, until they believe.
A believing slave is better than an idolater, though you may admire him.
Those call unto the Fire; and God calls unto Paradise, and pardon, by His leave, and He makes clear His signs to the people; haply they will remember.
They will question thee concerning the monthly course.
Say: 'It is hurt; so go apart from women during the monthly course, and do not approach them till they are clean. When they have cleansed themselves, then come unto them as God has commanded you.'
Truly, God loves those who repent, and He loves those who cleanse themselves.
Your women are a tillage for you; so come unto your tillage as you wish, and forward for your souls; and fear God, and know that you shall meet Him.
Give thou good tidings to the believers.
Do not make God a hindrance, through your oaths, to being pious and godfearing, and putting things right between men.
Surely God is All-hearing, All-knowing.
God will not take you to task for a slip in your oaths; but He will take you to task for what your hearts have earned; and God is All-forgiving, All-clement.
For those who forswear their women a wait of four months; if they revert, God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate;
but if they resolve on divorce, surely God is All-hearing, All-knowing.
Divorced women shall wait by themselves for three periods; and it is not lawful for them to hide what God has created in their wombs; if they believe in God and the Last Day.
In such time their mates have better right to restore them, if they desire to set things right.
Women have such honourable rights as obligations, but their men have a degree above them; God is All-mighty, All-wise.
Divorce is twice; then honourable retention or setting free kindly.
It is not lawful for you to take of what you have given them unless the couple fear they may not maintain God's bounds; if you fear they may not maintain God's bounds, it is no fault in them for her to redeem herself.
Those are God's bounds; do not transgress them.
Whosoever transgresses the bounds of God -- those are the evildoers.
If he divorces her finally, she shall not be lawful to him after that, until she marries another husband.
If he divorces her, then it is no fault in them to return to each other, if they suppose that they will maintain God's bounds.
Those are God's bounds; He makes them clear unto a people that have knowledge.
When you divorce women, and they have reached their term, then retain them honourably or set them free honourably; do not retain them by force, to transgress; whoever does that has wronged himself.
Take not God's signs in mockery, and remember God's blessing upon you, and the Book and the Wisdom He has sent down on you, to admonish you.
And fear God, and know that God has knowledge of everything.
When you divorce women, and they have reached their term, do not debar them from marrying their husbands, when they have agreed together honourably.
That is an admonition for whoso of you believes in God and the Last Day; that is cleaner and purer for you; God knows, and you know not.
Mothers shall suckle their children two years completely, for such as desire to fulfil the suckling.
It is for the father to provide them and clothe them honourably.
No soul is charged save to its capacity; a mother shall not be pressed for her child, neither a father for his child.
The heir has a like duty.
But if the couple desire by mutual consent and consultation to wean, then it is no fault in them.
And if you desire to seek nursing for your children, it is no fault in you provide you hand over what you have given honourably; and fear God, and know that God sees the things you do.
And those of you who die, leaving wives, they shall wait by themselves for four months and ten nights; when they have reached their term then it is no fault in you what they may do with themselves honourably.
God is aware of the things you do.
There is no fault in you touching the proposal to women you offer, or hide in your hearts; God knows that you will be mindful of them; but do not make troth with them secretly without you speak honourable words. And do not resolve on the knot of marriage until the book has reached its term; and know that God knows what is in your hearts, so be fearful of Him; and know that God is All-forgiving, All-clement.
There is no fault in you, if you divorce women while as yet you have not touched them nor appointed any marriage-portion for them; yet make provision for them, the affluent man according to his means, and according to his means the needy man, honourably -- an obligation on the good-doers.
And if you divorce them before you have touched them, and you have already appointed for them a marriage-portion, then one-half of what you have appointed, unless it be they make remission, or he makes remission in whose hand is the knot of marriage; yet that you should remit is nearer to godfearing.
Forget not to be bountiful one towards another.
Surely God sees the things you do.
Be you watchful over the prayers, and the middle prayer; and do you stand obedient to God.
And if you are in fear, then afoot or mounted; but when you are secure, then remember God, as He taught you the things that you knew not.
And those of you who die, leaving wives, let them make testament for their wives, provision for a year without expulsion; but if they go forth, there is no fault in you what they may do with themselves honourably; God is All-mighty, All-wise.
There shall be for divorced women provision honourable -- an obligation on the godfearing.
So God makes clear His signs for you; haply you will understand.
Hast thou not regarded those who went forth from their habitations in their thousands fearful of death?
God said to them, 'Die!'
Then He gave them life. Truly God is bounteous to the people, but most of the people are not thankful.
So fight in God's way, and know that God is All-hearing, All-knowing.
Who is he that will lend God a good loan, and He will multiply it for him manifold?
God grasps, and outspreads; and unto Him you shall be returned.
Hast thou not regarded the Council of the Children of Israel, after Moses, when they said to a Prophet of theirs, 'Raise up for us a king, and we will fight in God's way.'
He said, 'Might it be that, if fighting is prescribed for you, you will not fight?'
They said, 'Why should we not fight in God's way, who have been expelled from our habitations and our children?'
Yet when fighting was prescribed for them, they turned their backs except a few of them; and God has knowledge of the evildoers.
Then their Prophet said to them, 'Verily God has raised up Saul for you as king.'
They said, 'How should he be king over us who have better right than he to kingship, seeing he has not been given amplitude of wealth?'
He said, 'God has chosen him over you, and has increased him broadly in knowledge and body.
God gives the kingship to whom He will; and God is All-embracing, All-knowing.'
And their Prophet said to them, 'The sign of his kingship is that the Ark will come to you, in it a Shechina from your Lord, and a remnant of what the folk of Moses and Aaron's folk left behind, the angels bearing it.
Surely in that shall be a sign for you, if you are believers.'
And when Saul went forth with the hosts he said, 'God will try you with a river; whosoever drinks of it is not of me, and whoso tastes it flot, he is of me, saving him who scoops up with his hand.'
But they drank of it, except a few of them; and when he crossed it, and those who believed with him, they said, 'We have no power today against Goliath and his hosts.'
Said those who reckoned they should meet God, 'How often a little company has overcome a numerous company, by God's leave!
And God is with the patient.'
So, when they went forth against Goliath and his hosts, they said, 'Our Lord, pour out upon us patience, and make firm our feet, and give us aid against the people of the unbelievers!'
And they routed them, by the leave of God, and David slew Goliath; and God gave him the kingship, and Wisdom, and He taught him such as He willed.
Had God not driven back the people, some by the means of others, the earth had surely corrupted; but God is bounteous unto all beings.
These are the signs of God We recite to thee in truth, and assuredly thou art of the number of the Envoys.
And those Messengers, some We have preferred above others; some there are to whom God spoke, and some He raised in rank. And We gave Jesus son of Mary the clear signs, and confirmed him with the Holy Spirit. And had God willed, those who came after him would not have fought one against the other after the clear signs had come to them; but they fell into variance, and some of them believed, and some disbelieved; and had God willed they would not have fought one against the other; but God does whatsoever He desires.
O believers, expend of that wherewith We have provided you, before there comes a day wherein shall be neither traffick, nor friendship, nor intercession; and the unbelievers -- they are the evildoers.
God there is no god but He, the Living, the Everlasting.
Slumber seizes Him not, neither sleep; to Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth.
Who is there that shall intercede with Him save by His leave?
He knows what lies before them and what is after them, and they comprehend not anything of His knowledge save such as He wills.
His Throne comprises the heavens and earth; the preserving of them oppresses Him not; He is the All-high, the All-glorious.
No compulsion is there in religion.
Rectitude has become clear from error.
So whosoever disbelieves in idols and believes in God, has laid hold of the most firm handle, unbreaking; God is All-hearing, All-knowing.
God is the Protector of the believers; He brings them forth from the shadows into the light. And the unbelievers -- their protectors are idols, that bring them forth from the light into the shadows; those are the inhabitants of the Fire, therein dwelling forever.
Hast thou not regarded him who disputed with Abraham, concerning his Lord, that God had given him the kingship?
When Abraham said, 'My Lord is He who gives life, and makes to die,' he said, 'I give life, and make to die.'
Said Abraham, 'God brings the sun from the east; so bring thou it from the west.'
Then the unbeliever was confounded.
God guides not the people of the evildoers.
Or such as he who passed by a city that was fallen down upon its turrets; he said, 'How shall God give life to this now it is dead?'
So God made him die a hundred years, then He raised him up, saying, 'How long hast thou tarried?'
He said, 'I have tarried a day, or part of a day.'
Said He, 'Nay; thou hast tarried a hundred years.
Look at thy food and drink -- it has not spoiled; and look at thy ass.
So We would make thee a sign for the people.
And look at the bones; how We shall set them up, and then clothe them with flesh.'
So, when it was made clear to him, he said, 'I know that God is powerful over everything.'
And when Abraham said, 'My Lord, show me how Thou wilt give life to the dead,' He said, 'Why, dost thou not believe?'
'Yes,' he said, 'but that my heart may be at rest.'
Said He, 'Take four birds, and twist them to thee, then set a part of them on every hill, then summon them, and they will come to thee running.
And do thou know that God is All-mighty, All-wise.'
The likeness of those who expend their wealth in the way of God is as the likeness of a grain of corn that sprouts seven ears, in every ear a hundred grains.
So God multiplies unto whom He will; God is All-embracing, All-knowing.
Those who expend their wealth in the way of God then follow not up what they have expended with reproach and injury, their wage is with their Lord, and no fear shall be on them, neither shall they sorrow.
Honourable words, and forgiveness, are better than a freewill offering followed by injury; and God is All-sufficient, All-clement.
O believers, void not your freewill offerings with reproach and injury, as one who expends of his substance to show off to men and believes not in God and the Last Day.
The likeness of him is as the likeness of a smooth rock on which is soil, and a torrent smites it, and leaves it barren.
They have no power over anything that they have earned. God guides not the people of the unbelievers.
But the likeness of those who expend their wealth, seeking God's good pleasure, and to confirm themselves, is as the likeness of a garden upon a hill; a torrent smites it and it yields its produce twofold; if no torrent smites it, yet dew; and God sees the things you do.
Would any of you wish to have a garden of palms and vines, with rivers flowing beneath it, and all manner of fruit there for him, then old age smites him, and he has seed, but weaklings, then a whirlwind with fire smites it, and it is consumed?
So God makes clear the signs to you; haply you will reflect.
O believers, expend of the good things you have earned, and of that We have produced for you from the earth, and intend not the corrupt of it for your expending; for you would never take it yourselves, except you closed an eye on it; and know that God is All-sufficient, All-laudable.
Satan promises you poverty, and bids you unto indecency; but God promises you His pardon and His bounty; and God is All-embracing, All-knowing.
He gives the Wisdom to whomsoever He will, and whoso is given the Wisdom, has been given much good; yet none remembers but men possessed of minds.
And whatever expenditure you expend, and whatever vow you vow, surely God knows it. No helpers have the evildoers.
If you publish your freewill offerings, it is excellent; but if you conceal them, and give them to the poor, that is better for you, and will acquit you of your evil deeds; God is aware of the things you do.
Thou art not responsible for guiding them; but God guides whomsoever He will.
And whatever good you expend is for yourselves, for then you are expending, being desirous only of God's Face; and whatever good you expend shall be repaid to you in full, and you will not be wronged,
it being for the poor who are restrained in the way of God, and are unable to journey in the land; the ignorant man supposes them rich because of their abstinence, but thou shalt know them by their mark -- they do not beg of men importunately. And whatever good you expend, surely God has knowledge of it.
Those who expend their wealth night and day, secretly and in public, their wage awaits them with their Lord, and no fear shall be on them, neither shall they sorrow.
Those who devour usury shall not rise again except as he rises, whom Satan of the touch prostrates; that is because they say, 'Trafficking (trade) is like usury.'
God has permitted trafficking, and forbidden usury.
Whosoever receives an admonition from his Lord and gives over, he shall have his past gains, and his affair is committed to God; but whosoever reverts -- those are the inhabitants of the Fire, therein dwelling forever.
God blots out usury, but freewill offerings He augments with interest.
God loves not any guilty ingrate.
Those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, and perform the prayer, and pay the alms -- their wage awaits them with their Lord, and no fear shall be on them, neither shall they sorrow.
O believers, fear you God; and give up the usury that is outstanding, if you are believers.
But if you do not, then take notice that God shall war with you, and His Messenger; yet if you repent, you shall have your principal, unwronging and unwronged.
And if any man should be in difficulties, let him have respite till things are easier; but that you should give freewill offerings is better for you, did you but know.
And fear a day wherein you shall be returned to God, and every soul shall be paid in full what it has earned; and they shall not be wronged.
O believers, when you contract a debt one upon another for a stated term, write it down, and let a writer write it down between you justly, and let not any writer refuse to write it down, as God has taught him; so let him write, and let the debtor dictate, and let him fear God his Lord and not diminish aught of it.
And if the debtor be a fool, or weak, or unable to dictate himself, then let his guardian dictate justly.
And call in to witness two witnesses, men; or if the two be not men, then one man and two women, such witnesses as you approve of, that if one of the two women errs the other will remind her; and let the witnesses not refuse, whenever they are summoned.
And be not loth to write it down, whether it be small or great, with its term; that is more equitable in God's sight, more upright for testimony, and likelier that you will not be in doubt.
Unless it be merchandise present that you give and take between you; then it shall be no fault in you if you do not write it down.
And take witnesses when you are trafficking one with another.
And let not either writer or witness be pressed; or if you do, that is ungodliness in you.
And fear God; God teaches you, and God has knowledge of everything.
And if you are upon a journey, and you do not find a writer, then a pledge in hand.
But if one of you trusts another, let him who is trusted deliver his trust, and let him fear God his Lord.
And do not conceal the testimony; whoso conceals it, his heart is sinful; and God has knowledge of the things you do.
To God belongs all that is in the heavers and earth.
Whether you publish what is in your hearts or hide it, God shall make reckoning with you for it.
He will forgive whom He will, and chastise whom He will; God is powerful over everything.
The Messenger believes in what was sent down to him from his Lord, and the believers; each one believes in God and His angels, and in His Books and His Messengers; we make no division between any one of His Messengers.
They say, 'We hear, and obey.
Our Lord, grant us Thy forgiveness; unto Thee is the homecoming.'
God charges no soul save to its capacity; standing to its account is what it has earned, and against its account what it has merited.
Our Lord, take us not to task if we forget, or make mistake.
Our Lord; charge us not with a load such as Thou didst lay upon those before us.
Our Lord, do Thou not burden us beyond what we have the strength to bear.
And pardon us, and forgive us, and have mercy on us; Thou art our Protector.
And help us against the people of the unbelievers.
Alif Lam Mim
God, there is no god but He, the Living, the Everlasting.
He has sent down upon thee the Book with the truth, confirming what was before it, and He sent down the Torah and the Gospel
aforetime, as guidance to the people, and He sent down the Salvation.
As for those who disbelieve in God's signs, for them awaits a terrible chastisement; God is All-mighty, Vengeful.
From God nothing whatever is hidden in heaven and earth.
It is He who forms you in the womb as He will.
There is no god but He, the All-mighty, the All-wise.
It is He who sent down upon thee the Book, wherein are verses clear that are the Essence of the Book, and others ambiguous. As for those in whose hearts is swerving, they follow the ambiguous part, desiring dissension, and desiring its interpretation; and none knows its interpretation, save only God. And those firmly rooted in knowledge say, 'We believe in it; all is from our Lord'; yet none remembers, but men possessed of minds.
Our Lord, make not our hearts to swerve after that Thou hast guided us; and give us mercy from Thee; Thou art the Giver.
Our Lord, it is Thou that shall gather mankind for a day whereon is no doubt; verily God will not fail the tryst.
As for the unbelievers, their riches will not avail them, neither their children, aught against God; those -- they shall be fuel for the Fire
like Pharaoh's folk, and the people before them, who cried lies to Our signs; God seized them because of their sins; God is terrible in retribution.
Say to the unbelievers: 'You shall be overthrown, and mustered into Gehenna -- an evil cradling!'
There has already been a sign for you in the two companies that encountered, one company fighting in the way of God and another unbelieving; they saw them twice the like of them, as the eye sees, but God confirms with His help whom He will.
Surely in that is a lesson for men possessed of eyes.
Decked out fair to men is the love of lusts -- women, children, heaped-up heaps of gold and silver, horses of mark, cattle and tillage.
That is the enjoyment of the present life; but God -- with Him is the fairest resort.
Say: 'Shall I tell you of a better than that?'
For those that are godfearing, with their Lord are gardens underneath which rivers flow, therein dwelling forever, and spouses purified, and God's good pleasure.
And God sees His servants
who say, 'Our Lord, we believe; forgive us our sins, and guard us against the chastisement of the Fire' --
men who are patient, truthful, obedient, expenders in alms, imploring God's pardon at the daybreak.
God bears witness that there is no god but He -- and the angels, and men possessed of knowledge -- upholding justice; there is no god but He, the All-mighty, the All-wise.
The true religion with God is Islam.
Those who were given the Book were not at variance except after the knowledge came to them, being insolent one to another.
And whoso disbelieves in God's signs. God is swift at the reckoning.
So if they dispute with thee, say: 'I have surrendered my will to God, and whosoever follows me.
And say to those who have been given the Book and to the common folk: 'Have you surrendered?'
If they have surrendered, they are right guided; but if they turn their backs, thine it is only to deliver the Message; and God sees His servants.
Those who disbelieve in the signs of God and slay the Prophets without right, and slay such men as bid to justice -- do thou give them the good tidings of a painful chastisement;
their works have failed in this world and the next; they have no helpers.
Hast thou not regarded those who were given a portion of the Book, being called to the Book of God, that it might decide between them, and then a party of them turned away, swerving aside?
That, because they said, 'The Fire shall not touch us, except for a number of days'; and the lies they forged has deluded them in their religion.
But how will it be, when We gather them for a day whereon is no doubt, and every soul shall be paid in full what it has earned, and they shall not be wronged?
Say: 'O God, Master of the Kingdom, Thou givest the Kingdom to whom Thou wilt, and seizest the Kingdom from whom Thou wilt, Thou exaltest whom Thou wilt, and Thou abasest whom Thou wilt; in Thy hand is the good; Thou art powerful over everything.
Thou makest the night to enter into the day and Thou makest the day to enter into the night, Thou bringest forth the living from the dead and Thou bringest forth the dead from the living, and Thou providest whomsoever Thou wilt without reckoning.
Let not the believers take the unbelievers for friends, rather than the believers -- for whoso does that belongs not to God in anything -- unless you have a fear of them.
God warns you that You beware of Him, and unto God is the homecoming.
Say: 'Whether you hide what is in your breasts or publish it, God knows it. God knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth; and God is powerful over everything.'
The day every soul shall find what it has done of good brought forward, and what it has done of evil; it will wish if there were only a far space between it and that day.
God warns you that you beware of Him; and God is gentle with His servants.
Say: 'If you love God, follow me, and God will love you, and forgive you your sins; God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.'
Say: 'Obey God, and the Messenger.' But if they turn their backs, God loves not the unbelievers.
God chose Adam and Noah and the House of Abraham and the House of Imran above all beings, the
seed of one another; God hears, and knows.
When the wife of Imran said, 'Lord, I have vowed to Thee, in dedication, what is within my womb. Receive Thou this from me; Thou hearest, and knowest.'
And when she gave birth to her she said, 'Lord, I have given birth to her, a female.'
(And God knew very well what she had given birth to; the male is not as the female.)
'And I have named her Mary, and commend her to Thee with her seed, to protect them from the accursed Satan.'
Her Lord received the child with gracious favour, and by His goodness she grew up comely, Zachariah taking charge of her.
Whenever Zachariah went in to her in the Sanctuary, he found her provisioned.
'Mary,' he said, 'how comes this to thee?'
'From God,' she said. Truly God provisions whomsoever He will without reckoning.
Then Zachariah prayed to his Lord saying, 'Lord, give me of Thy goodness a goodly offspring. Yea, Thou hearest prayer.'
And the angels called to him, standing in the Sanctuary at worship, 'Lo, God gives thee good tidings of John, who shall confirm a Word of God, a chief, and chaste, a Prophet, righteous.'
'Lord,' said Zachariah, 'how shall I have a son, seeing I am an old man and my wife is barren?'
'Even so,' God said, 'God does what He will.'
'Lord,' said Zachariah, 'appoint to me a sign.'
'Thy sign,' God said, 'is that thou shalt not speak, save by tokens, to men for three days.
And mention thy Lord oft, and give glory at evening and dawn.'
And when the angels said, 'Mary, God has chosen thee, and purified thee; He has chosen thee above all women.
Mary; be obedient to thy Lord, prostrating and bowing before Him.'
(That is of the tidings of the Unseen, that We reveal to thee; for thou wast not with them, when they were casting quills which of them should have charge of Mary; thou wast not with them, when they were disputing.)
When the angels said, 'Mary, God gives thee good tidings of a Word from Him whose name is Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary; high honoured shall he be in this world and the next, near stationed to God.
He shall speak to men in the cradle, and of age, and righteous he shall be.'
'Lord,' said Mary, 'how shall I have a son seeing no mortal has touched me?'
'Even so,' God said, God creates what He will. When He decrees a thing He does but say to it "Be," and it is.
And He will teach him the Book, the Wisdom, the Torah, the Gospel,
to be a Messenger to the Children of Israel saying, "I have come to you with a sign from your Lord.
I will create for you out of clay as the likeness of a bird; then I will breathe into it, and it will be a bird, by the leave of God.
I will also heal the blind and the leper, and bring to life the dead, by the leave of God. I will inform you too of what things you eat, and what you treasure up in your houses.
Surely in that is a sign for you, if you are believers.
Likewise confirming the truth of the Torah that is before me, and to make lawful to you certain things that before were forbidden unto you. I have come to you with a sign from your Lord; so fear you God, and obey you me.
Surely God is my Lord and your Lord; so serve Him.
This is a straight path".'
And when Jesus perceived their unbelief, he said, 'Who will be my helpers unto God?'
The Apostles said, 'We will be helpers of God; we believe in God; witness thou our submission.
Lord, we believe in that Thou hast sent down, and we follow the Messenger.
Inscribe us therefore with those who bear witness.'
And they devised, and God devised, and God is the best of devisers.
When God said, 'Jesus, I will take thee to Me and will raise thee to Me and I will purify thee of those who believe not. I will set thy followers above the unbelievers till the Resurrection Day.
Then unto Me shall you return, and I will decide between you, as to what you were at variance on.
As for the unbelievers, I will chastise them with a terrible chastisement in this world and the next; they shall have no helpers.'
But as for the believers, who do deeds of righteousness, He will pay them in full their wages: and God loves not the evildoers.
This We recite to thee of signs and wise remembrance.
Truly, the likeness of Jesus, in God's sight, is as Adam's likeness; He created him of dust, then said He unto him, 'Be,' and he was.
The truth is of God; be not of the doubters.
And whoso disputes with thee concerning him, after the knowledge that has come to thee, say: 'Come now, let us call our sons and your sons, our wives and your wives, our selves and your selves, then let us humbly pray and so lay God's curse upon the ones who lie.'
This is the true story. There is no god but God, and assuredly God is the All-mighty, the All-wise.
And if they turn their backs, assuredly God knows the workers of corruption.
Say: 'People of the Book! Come now to a word common between us and you, that we serve none but God, and that we associate not aught with Him, and do not some of us take others as Lords, apart from God.'
And if they turn their backs, say: 'Bear witness that we are Muslims.'
Why do you dispute concerning Abraham? The Torah was not sent down, neither the Gospel, but after him.
What, have you no reason?
Ha, you are the ones who dispute on what you know; why then dispute you touching a matter of which you know not anything?
God knows, and you know not.
No; Abraham in truth was not a Jew, neither a Christian; but he was a Muslim and one pure of faith; certainly he was never of the idolaters.
Surely the people standing closest to Abraham are those who followed him, and this Prophet, and those who believe; and God is the Protector of the believers.
There is a party of the People of the Book yearn to make you go astray; yet none they make to stray, except themselves, but they are not aware.
People of the Book! Why do you disbelieve in God's signs, which you yourselves witness?
People of the Book! Why do you confound the truth with vanity, and conceal the truth and that wittingly?
There is a party of the People of the Book say, 'Believe in what has been sent down upon those who believe at the beginning of the day, and disbelieve at the end of it; haply they will then return;
and believe not any but him who follows your religion.'
Say: 'The true guidance is God's guidance -- that anyone should be given the like of what you have been given, or dispute with you before your Lord.' Say: 'Surely bounty is in the hand of God; He gives it unto whomsoever He will; and God is All-embracing, All-knowing.
He singles out for His mercy whom He will; God is of bounty abounding.'
And of the People of the Book is he who, if thou trust him with a hundredweight, will restore it thee; and of them is he who, if thou trust him with one pound, will not restore it thee, unless ever thou standest over him.
That, because they say, 'There is no way over us as to the common people.'
They speak falsehood against God and that wittingly.
Nay, but whoso fulfils his covenant and fears God, God loves the godfearing.
Those that sell God's covenant, and their oaths, for a little price, there shall be no share for them in the world to come; God shall not speak to them neither look on them on the Resurrection Day, neither will He purify them; and for them awaits a painful chastisement.
And there is a sect of them twist their tongues with the Book, that you may suppose it part of the Book, yet it is not part of the Book; and they say, 'It is from God,' yet it is not from God, and they speak falsehood against God, and that wittingly.
It belongs not to any mortal that God should give him the Book, the Judgment, the Prophethood, then he should say to men, 'Be you servants to me apart from God.'
Rather, 'Be you masters in that you know the Book, and in that you study.'
He would never order you to take the angels and the Prophets as Lords; what, would He order you to disbelieve, after you have surrendered?
And when God took compact with the Prophets: 'That I have given you of Book and Wisdom; then there shall come to you a Messenger confirming what is with you -- you shall believe in him and you shall help him; do you agree?' He said.
'And do you take My load on you on that condition?'
They said, 'We do agree.'
God said, 'Bear witness so, and I shall be with you among the witnesses.'
Then whosoever turns his back after that -- they are the ungodly.
What, do they desire another religion than God's, and to Him has surrendered whoso is in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly, and to Him they shall be returned?
Say: 'We believe in God, and that which has been sent down on us, and sent down on Abraham and Ishmael, Isaac and Jacob, and the Tribes, and in that which was given to Moses and Jesus, and the Prophets, of their Lord; we make no division between any of them, and to Him we surrender.'
Whoso desires another religion than Islam, it shall not be accepted of him; in the next world he shall be among the losers.
How shall God guide a people who have disbelieved after they believed, and bore witness that the Messenger is true, and the clear signs came to them?
God guides not the people of the evildoers.
Those -- their recompense is that there shall rest on them the curse of God and of the angels and of men, altogether,
therein dwelling forever; the chastisement shall not be lightened for them; no respite shall be given them.
But those who repent thereafter, and make amends -- God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
Surely those who disbelieve after they have believed and then increase in unbelief -- their repentance shall not be accepted; those are the ones who stray.
Surely those who disbelieve, and die disbelieving, there shall not be accepted from any one of them the whole earth full of gold, if he would ransom himself thereby; for them awaits a painful chastisement, and they shall have no helpers.
You will not attain piety until you expend of what you love; and whatever thing you expend, God knows of it.
All food was lawful to the Children of Israel save what Israel forbade for himself before the Torah was sent down.
Say: 'Bring you the Torah now, and recite it, if you are truthful.'
Whoso forges falsehood against God after that, those are the evildoers.
Say: 'God has spoken the truth; therefore follow the creed of Abraham, a man of pure faith and no idolater.'
The first House established for the people was that at Bekka, a place holy, and a guidance to all beings.
Therein are clear signs -- the station of Abraham, and whosoever enters it is in security.
It is the duty of all men towards God to come to the House a pilgrim, if he is able to make his way there.
As for the unbeliever, God is All-sufficient nor needs any being.
Say: 'People of the Book, why do you disbelieve in the signs of God? Surely God is witness of the things you do.'
Say: 'People of the Book, why do you bar from God's way the believer, desiring to make it crooked, yourselves being witnesses?
God is not heedless of the things you do.'
O believers, if you obey a sect of those who have been given the Book, they will turn you, after you have believed, into unbelievers.
How can you disbelieve, seeing you have God's signs recited to you, and His Messenger among you?
Whosoever holds fast to God, he is guided to a straight path.
O believers, fear God as He should be feared, and see you do not die, save in surrender.
And hold you fast to God's bond, together, and do not scatter; remember God's blessing upon you when you were enemies, and He brought your hearts together, so that by His blessing you became brothers. You were upon the brink of a pit of Fire, and He delivered you from it; even so God makes clear to you His signs; so haply you will be guided.
Let there be one nation of you, calling to good, and bidding to honour, and forbidding dishonour; those are the prosperers.
Be not as those who scattered and fell into variance after the clear signs came to them; those there awaits a mighty chastisement,
the day when some faces are blackened, and some faces whitened.
As for those whose faces are blackened -- 'Did you disbelieve after you had believed?
Then taste the chastisement for that you disbelieved!'
But as for those whose faces are whitened, they shall be in God's mercy, therein dwelling forever.
These are the signs of God We recite to thee in truth, and God desires not any injustice to living beings.
To God belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth, and unto Him all matters are returned.
You are the best nation ever brought forth to men, bidding to honour, and forbidding dishonour, and believing in God.
Had the People of the Book believed, it were better for them; some of them are believers, but the most of them are ungodly.
They will not harm you, except a little hurt; and if they fight with you, they will turn on you their backs; then they will not be helped.
Abasement shall be pitched on them, wherever they are come upon, except they be in a bond of God, and a bond of the people; they will be laden with the burden of God's anger, and poverty shall be pitched on them; that, because they disbelieved in God's signs, and slew the Prophets without right; that, for that they acted rebelliously and were transgressors.
Yet they are not all alike; some of the People of the Book are a nation upstanding, that recite God's signs in the watches of the night, bowing themselves,
believing in God and in the Last Day, bidding to honour and forbidding dishonour, vying one with the other in good works; those are of the righteous.
And whatsoever good you do, you shall not be denied the just reward of it; and God knows the godfearing.
As for the unbelievers, their riches shall not avail them, neither their children, against God; those are the inhabitants of the Fire, therein dwelling forever.
The likeness of that they expend in this present life is as the likeness of a freezing blast that smites the tillage of a people who wronged themselves, and it destroyed that; God wronged them not, but themselves they wronged.
O believers, take not for your intimates outside yourselves such men spare nothing to ruin you; they yearn for you to suffer Hatred has already shown itself of their mouths, and what their breasts conceal is yet greater.
Now We have made clear to you the signs, if you understand.
Ha, there you are; you love them, and they love you not; you believe in the Book, all of it, and when they meet you they say, 'We believe,' but when they go privily, they bite at you their fingers, enraged. Say: 'Die in your rage; God knows the thoughts in the breasts.'
If you are visited by good fortune, it vexes them; but if you are smitten by evil, they rejoice at it.
Yet if you are patient and godfearing, their guile will hurt you nothing; God encompasses the things they do.
When thou wentest forth at dawn from thy people to lodge the believers in their pitches for the battle -- God is All-hearing, All-knowing --
when two parties of you were about to lose heart, though God was their Protector -- and in God let the believers put all their trust --
and God most surely helped you at Badr, when you were utterly abject. So fear God, and haply you Will be thankful.
When thou saidst to the believers, 'Is it not enough for you that your Lord should reinforce you with three thousand angels sent down upon you?
Yea; if you are patient and godfearing, and the foe come against you instantly, your Lord will reinforce you with five thousand swooping angels.'
God wrought this not, save as good tiding to you, and that your hearts might be at rest; help comes only from God the All-mighty, the All-wise;
and that He might cut off a part of the unbelievers or frustrate them, so that they turned in their tracks, disappointed.
No part of the matter is thine, whether He turns towards them again, or chastises them; for they are evildoers.
To God belongs all that is in the heavens and earth; He forgives whom He will, and chastises whom He will; God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
O believers, devour not usury, doubled and redoubled, and fear you God; haply so you will prosper.
And fear the Fire prepared for the unbelievers,
and obey God and the Messenger; haply so you will find mercy.
And vie with one another, hastening to forgiveness from your Lord, and to a garden whose breadth is as the heavens and earth, prepared for the godfearing
who expend in prosperity and adversity in almsgiving, and restrain their rage, and pardon the offences of their fellowmen; and God loves the good-doers;
who, when they commit an indecency or wrong themselves, remember God, and pray forgiveness for their sins -- and who shall forgive sins but God? -- and do not persevere in the things they did and that wittingly.
Those -- their recompense is forgiveness from their Lord, and gardens beneath which rivers flow, therein dwelling forever; and how excellent is the wage of those who labour!
Divers institutions have passed away before you; journey in the land, and behold how was the end of those that cried lies.
This is an exposition for mankind, and a guidance, and an admonition for such as are godfearing.
Faint not, neither sorrow; you shall be the upper ones if you are believers.
If a wound touches you, a like wound already has touched the heathen; such days We deal out in turn among men, and that God may know who are the believers, and that He may take witnesses from among you; and God loves not the evildoers;
and that God may prove the believers, and blot out the unbelievers.
Or did you suppose you should enter Paradise without God know who of you have struggled and who are patient?
You were longing for death before you met it; now you have seen it, while you were beholding.
Muhammad is naught but a Messenger; Messengers have passed away before him.
Why, if he should die or is slain, will you turn about on your heels?
If any man should turn about on his heels, he will not harm God in any way; and God will recompense the thankful.
It is not given to any soul to die, save by the leave of God, at an appointed time.
Whoso desires the reward of this world, We will give him of this; and whoso desires the reward of the other world, We will give him of that; and We will recompense the thankful.
Many a Prophet there has been, with whom thousands manifold have fought, and they fainted not for what smote them in God's way, neither weakened, nor did they humble themselves; and God loves the patient.
Nothing else they said but, 'Lord, forgive us our sins, and that we exceeded in our affair, and make firm our feet, and help us against the people of the unbelievers.'
And God gave them the reward of this world and the fairest reward of the world to come; and God loves the good-doers.
O believers, if you obey the unbelievers they will turn you upon your heels, and you will turn about, losers.
No; but God is your Protector, and He is the best of helpers.
We will cast into the hearts of the unbelievers terror, for that they have associated with God that for which He sent down never authority; their lodging shall be the Fire; evil is the lodging of the evildoers.
God has been true in His promise towards you when you blasted them by His leave; until you lost heart, and quarrelled about the matter, and were rebellious, after He had shown you that you longed for.
Some of you there are that desire this world, and some of you there are desire the next world.
Then He turned you from them, that He might try you; and He has pardoned you; and God is bounteous to the believers.
When you were going up, not twisting about for anyone, and the Messenger was calling you in your rear; so He rewarded you with grief on grief that you might not sorrow for what escaped you neither for what smote you; and God is aware of the things you do.
Then He sent down upon you, after grief, security -- a slumber overcoming a party of you; and a party themselves had grieved, thinking of God thoughts that were not true such as the pagans thought, saying, 'Have we any part whatever in the affair?'
Say: 'The affair belongs to God entirely.'
They were concealing in their hearts that they show not to thee, saying, 'Ah, if we had had a part in the affair, never would we have been slain here.'
Say: 'Even if you had been in your houses, those for whom slaying was appointed would have sallied forth unto their last couches'; and that God might try what was in your breasts, and that He might prove what was in your hearts; and God knows the thoughts in the breasts.
Those of you who turned away the day the two hosts encountered -- Satan made them slip for somewhat they had earned; but God has pardoned them; God is All-forgiving, All-clement.
O believers, be not as the unbelievers who say to their brothers, when they journey in the land, or are upon expeditions, 'If they had been with us, they would not have died and not been slain' -- that God may make that an anguish in their hearts.
For God gives life, and He makes to die; and God sees the things you do.
If you are slain or die in God's way, forgiveness and mercy from God are a better thing than that you amass;
surely if you die or are slain, it is unto God you shall be mustered.
It was by some mercy of God that thou wast gentle to them; hadst thou been harsh and hard of heart, they would have scattered from about thee.
So pardon them, and pray forgiveness for them, and take counsel with them in the affair; and when thou art resolved, put thy trust in God; surely God loves those who put their trust.
If God helps you, none can overcome you; but if He forsakes you, who then can help you after Him?
Therefore in God let the believers put all their trust.
It is not for a Prophet to be fraudulent; whoso defrauds shall bring the fruits of his fraud on the Day of Resurrection; then every soul shall be paid in full what it has earned, and they shall not be wronged.
What, is he who follows God's good pleasure like him who is laden with the burden of God's anger, whose refuge is Gehenna?
An evil homecoming!
They are in ranks with God; and God sees the things they do.
Truly God was gracious to the believers when He raised up among them a Messenger from themselves, to recite to them His signs and to purify them, and to teach them the Book and the Wisdom, though before they were in manifest error.
Why, when an affliction visited you, and you had visited twice over the like of it, did you say, 'How is this?'
Say: 'This is from your own selves; surely God is powerful over everything.'
And what visited you, the day the two hosts encountered, was by God's leave, and that He might know the believers;
and that He might also know the hypocrites when it was said of them, 'Come now, fight in the way of God, or repel!'
They said, 'If only we knew how to fight, we would follow you.'
They that day were nearer to unbelief than to belief, saying with their mouths that which never was in their hearts; and God knows very well the things they hide;
who said of their brothers (and they themselves held back), 'Had they obeyed us, they would not have been slain.'
Say: 'Then avert death from yourselves, if you speak truly.'
Count not those who were slain in God's way as dead, but rather living with their Lord, by Him provided,
rejoicing in the bounty that God has given them, and joyful in those who remain behind and have not joined them, because no fear shall be on them, neither shall they sorrow,
joyful in blessing and bounty from God, and that God leaves not to waste the wage of the believers.
And those who answered God and the Messenger after the wound had smitten them - to all those of them who did good and feared God, shall be a mighty wage;
those to whom the people said, 'The people have gathered against you, therefore fear them', but it increased them in faith, and they said, 'God is sufficient for us; an excellent Guardian is He.'
So they returned with blessing and bounty from God, untouched by evil; they followed the good pleasure of God; and God is of bounty abounding.
That is Satan frightening his friends, therefore do not fear them; but fear you Me, if you are believers.
Let them not grieve thee that vie with one another in unbelief; they will nothing hurt God; God desires not to appoint for them a portion in the world to come, and there awaits them a mighty chastisement.
Those who buy unbelief at the price of faith, they will nothing hurt God; and there awaits them a painful chastisement.
And let not the unbelievers suppose that the indulgence We grant them is better for them; We grant them indulgence only that they may increase in sin; and there awaits them a humbling chastisement.
God will not leave the believers in the state in which you are, till He shall distinguish the corrupt from the good, and God will not inform you of the Unseen; but God chooses out of His Messengers whom He will. Believe you then in God and His Messengers; and if you believe and are godfearing, there shall be for you a mighty wage.
But as for those who are niggardly with the bounty God has given them, let them not suppose it is better for them; nay, it is worse for them; that they were niggardly with they shall have hung about their necks on the Resurrection Day; and to God belongs the inheritance of the heavens and earth; and God is aware of the things you do.
God has heard the saying of those who said, 'Surely God is poor, and we are rich.'
We shall write down what they have said, and their slaying the Prophets without right, and We shall say, 'Taste the chastisement of the burning --
that, for what your hands have forwarded, and for that God is never unjust unto His servants.'
Those same men said, 'God has made covenant with us, that we believe not any Messenger until he brings to us a sacrifice devoured by fire.'
Say: 'Messengers have come to you before me bearing clear signs, and that you spoke of; why therefore did you slay them, if you speak truly?'
But if they cry lies to thee, lies were cried to Messengers before thee, who came bearing clear signs, and the Psalms, and the Book Illuminating.
Every soul shall taste of death; you shall surely be paid in full your wages on the Day of Resurrection. Whosoever is removed from the Fire and admitted to Paradise, shall win the triumph.
The present life is but the joy of delusion.
You shall surely be tried in your possessions and your selves, and you shall hear from those who were given the Book before you, and from those who are idolaters, much hurt; but if you are patient and godfearing -- surely that is true constancy.
And when God took compact with those who had been given the Book: 'You shall make it clear unto the people, and not conceal it.' But they rejected it behind their backs and sold it for a small price -- how evil was that their selling!
Reckon not that those who rejoice in what they have brought, and love to be praised for what they have not done -- do not reckon them secure from chastisement; for them awaits a painful chastisement.
To God belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and of the earth; and God is powerful over everything.
Surely in the creation of the heavens and earth and in the alternation of night and day there are signs for men possessed of minds
who remember God, standing and sitting and on their sides, and reflect upon the creation of the heavens and the earth: 'Our Lord, Thou hast not created this for vanity.
Glory be to Thee! Guard us against the chastisement of the Fire.
Our Lord, whomsoever Thou admittest into the Fire, Thou wilt have abased; and the evildoers shall have no helpers.
Our Lord, we have heard a caller calling us to belief, saying, "Believe you in your Lord!" And we believe.
Our Lord, forgive Thou us our sins and acquit us of our evil deeds, and take us to Thee with the pious.
Our Lord, give us what Thou hast promised us by Thy Messengers, and abase us not on the Day of Resurrection; Thou wilt not fail the tryst.'
And their Lord answers them: 'I waste not the labour of any that labours among you, be you male or female -- the one of you is as the other.
And those who emigrated, and were expelled from their habitations, those who suffered hurt in My way, and fought, and were slain -- them I shall surely acquit of their evil deeds, and I shall admit them to gardens underneath which rivers flow.' A reward from God!
And God with Him is the fairest reward.
Let it not delude thee, that the unbelievers go to and fro in the land;
a little enjoyment, then their refuge is Gehenna -- an evil cradling!
But those who fear their Lord - for them shall be gardens underneath which rivers flow, therein dwelling forever -- a hospitality God Himself offers; and that which is with God is better for the pious.
And some there are of the People of the Book who believe in God, and what has been sent down unto you, and what has been sent down unto them, men humble to God, not selling the signs of God for a small price; those -- their wage is with their Lord; God is swift at the reckoning.
O believers, be patient, and vie you in patience; be steadfast; fear God; haply so you will prosper.
Mankind, fear your Lord, who created you of a single soul, and from it created its mate, and from the pair of them scattered abroad many men and women; and fear God by whom you demand one of another, and the wombs; surely God ever watches over you.
Give the orphans their property, and do not exchange the corrupt for the good; and devour not their property with your property; surely that is a great crime.
If you fear that you will not act justly towards the orphans, marry such women as seem good to you, two, three, four; but if you fear you will not be equitable, then only one, or what your right hands own; so it is likelier you will not be partial.
And give the women their dowries as a gift spontaneous; but if they are pleased to offer you any of it, consume it with wholesome appetite.
But do not give to fools their property that God has assigned to you to manage; provide for them and clothe them out of it, and speak to them honourable words.
Test well the orphans, until they reach the age of marrying; then, if you perceive in them right judgment, deliver to them their property; consume it not wastefully and hastily ere they are grown.
If any man is rich, let him be abstinent; if poor, let him consume in reason.
And when you deliver to them their property, take witnesses over them; God suffices for a reckoner.
To the men a share of what parents and kinsmen leave, and to the women a share of what parents and kinsmen leave, whether it be little or much, a share apportioned;
and when the division is attended by kinsmen and orphans and the poor, make provision for them out of it, and speak to them honourable words.
And let those fear who, if they left behind them weak seed, would be afraid on their account, and let them fear God, and speak words hitting the mark.
Those who devour the property of orphans unjustly, devour Fire in their bellies, and shall assuredly roast in a Blaze.
God charges you, concerning your children: to the male the like of the portion of two females, and if they be women above two, then for them two-thirds of what he leaves, but if she be one then to her a half; and to his parents to each one of the two the sixth of what he leaves, if he has children; but if he has no children, and his heirs are his parents, a third to his mother, or, if he has brothers, to his mother a sixth, after any bequest he may bequeath, or any debt. Your fathers and your sons -- you know not which out of them is nearer in profit to you. So God apportions; surely God is All-knowing, All-wise.
And for you a half of what your wives leave, if they have no children; but if they have children, then for you of what they leave a fourth, after any bequest they may bequeath, or any debt.
And for them a fourth of what you leave, if you have no children; but if you have children, then for them of what you leave an eighth, after any bequest you may bequeath, or any debt.
If a man or a woman have no heir direct, but have a brother or a sister, to each of the two a sixth; but if they are more numerous than that, they share equally a third, after any bequest he may bequeath, or any debt not prejudicial; a charge from God. God is All-knowing, All-clement.
Those are God's bounds. Whoso obeys God and His Messenger, He will admit him to gardens underneath which rivers flow, therein dwelling forever; that is the mighty triumph.
But whoso disobeys God, and His Messenger, and transgresses His bounds, him He will admit to a Fire, therein dwelling forever, and for him there awaits a humbling chastisement.
Such of your women as commit indecency, call four of you to witness against them; and if they witness, then detain them in their houses until death takes them or God appoints for them a way.
And when two of you commit indecency, punish them both; but if they repent and make amends, then suffer them to be; God turns, and is All-compassionate.
God shall turn only towards those who do evil in ignorance, then shortly repent; God will return towards those; God is All-knowing, All-wise.
But God shall not turn towards those who do evil deeds until, when one of them is visited by death, he says, 'Indeed now I repent,' neither to those who die disbelieving; for them We have prepared a painful chastisement.
O believers, it is not lawful for you to inherit women against their will; neither debar them, that you may go off with part of what you have given them, except when they commit a flagrant indecency Consort with them honourably; or if you are averse to them, it is possible you may be averse to a thing, and God set in it much good.
And if you desire to exchange a wife in place of another, and you have given to one a hundredweight, take of it nothing.
What, will you take it by way of calumny and manifest sin?
How shall you take it, when each of you has been privily with the other, and they have taken from you a solemn compact?
And do not marry women that your fathers married, unless it be a thing of the past; surely that is indecent and hateful; an evil way.
Forbidden to you are your mothers and daughters, your sisters, your aunts paternal and maternal, your brother's daughters, your sister's daughters, your mothers who have given suck to you, your suckling sisters, your wives' mothers, your stepdaughters who are in your care being born of your wives you have been in to -- but if you have not yet been in to them it is no fault in you - and the spouses of your sons who are of your loins, and that you should take to you two sisters together, unless it be a thing of the past; God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate;
and wedded women, save what your right hands own.
So God prescribes for you.
Lawful for you, beyond all that, is that you may seek, using your wealth, in wedlock and not in licence.
Such wives as you enjoy thereby, give them their wages apportionate; it is no fault in you in your agreeing together, after the due apportionate.
God is All-knowing, All-wise.
Any one of you who has not the affluence to be able to marry believing freewomen in wedlock, let him take believing handmaids that your right hands own; God knows very well your faith; the one of you is as the other.
So marry them, with their people's leave, and give them their wages honourably as women in wedlock, not as in licence or taking lovers.
But when they are in wedlock, if they commit indecency, they shall be liable to half the chastisement of freewomen.
That provision is for those of you who fear fornication; yet it is better for you to be patient.
God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
God desires to make clear to you, and to guide you in the institutions of those before you, and to turn towards you; God is All-knowing, All-wise;
and God desires to turn towards you, but those who follow their lusts desire you to swerve away mightily.
God desires to lighten things for you, for man was created a weakling.
O believers, consume not your goods between you in vanity, except there be trading, by your agreeing together.
And kill not one another.
Surely God is compassionate to you.
But whosoever does that in transgression and wrongfully, him We shall certainly roast at a Fire; and that for God is an easy matter.
If you avoid the heinous sins that are forbidden you, We will acquit you of your evil deeds, and admit you by the gate of honour.
Do not covet that whereby God in bounty has preferred one of you above another.
To the men a share from what they have earned, and to the women a share from what they have earned.
And ask God of His bounty; God knows everything.
To everyone We have appointed heirs of that which parents and kinsmen leave, and those with whom you have sworn compact.
So give to them their share; God is witness over everything.
Men are the managers of the affairs of women for that God has preferred in bounty one of them over another, and for that they have expended of their property.
Righteous women are therefore obedient, guarding the secret for God's guarding.
And those you fear may be rebellious admonish; banish them to their couches, and beat them.
If they then obey you, look not for any way against them; God is All-high, All-great.
And if you fear a breach between the two, bring forth an arbiter from his people and from her people an arbiter, if they desire to set things right; God will compose their differences; surely God is All-knowing, All-aware.
Serve God, and associate naught with Him. Be kind to parents, and the near kinsman, and to orphans, and to the needy, and to the neighbour who is of kin, and to the neighbour who is a stranger, and to the companion at your side, and to the traveller, and to that your right hands own.
Surely God loves not the proud and boastful
such as are niggardly, and bid other men to be niggardly, and themselves conceal the bounty that God has given them. We have prepared for the unbelievers a humbling chastisement,
and such as expend of their substance to show off to men, and believe not in God and the Last Day. Whosoever has Satan for a comrade, an evil comrade is he.
Why, what would it harm them, if they believed in God and the Last Day, and expended of that God has provided them?
God knows them.
Surely God shall not wrong so much as the weight of an ant; and if it be a good deed He will double it, and give from Himself a mighty wage.
How then shall it be, when We bring forward from every nation a witness, and bring thee to witness against those?
Upon that day the unbelievers, those who have disobeyed the Messenger, will wish that the earth might be levelled with them; and they will not conceal from God one tiding.
O believers, draw not near to prayer when you are drunken until you know what you are saying, or defiled -- unless you are traversing a way -- until you have washed yourselves; but if you are sick, or on a journey, or if any of you comes from the privy, or you have touched women, and you can find no water, then have recourse to wholesome dust and wipe your faces and your hands; God is All-pardoning, All-forgiving.
Hast thou not regarded those who were given a share of the Book purchasing error, and desiring that you should also err from the way?
God knows well your enemies; God suffices as a protector, God suffices as a helper.
Some of the Jews pervert words from their meanings saying, 'We have heard and we disobey' and 'Hear, and be thou not given to hear' and 'Observe us,' twisting with their tongues and traducing religion.
If they had said, 'We have heard and obey' and 'Hear' and 'Regard us,' it would have been better for them, and more upright; but God has cursed them for their unbelief so they believe not except a few.
You who have been given the Book, believe in what We have sent down, confirming what is with you, before We obliterate faces, and turn them upon their backs, or curse them as We cursed the Sabbath-men, and God's command is done.
God forgives not that aught should be with Him associated; less than that He forgives to whomsoever He will.
Whoso associates with God anything, has indeed forged a mighty sin.
Hast thou not regarded those who purify themselves?
Nay; only God purifies whom He will; and they shall not be wronged a single date-thread.
Consider how they forge falsehood against God; and that suffices for a manifest sin;
Hast thou not regarded those who were given a share of the Book believing in demons and idols, and saying to the unbelievers, 'These are more rightly guided on the way than the believers'?
Those are they whom God has cursed; he whom God has cursed, thou wilt not find for him any helper.
Or have they a share in the Kingdom?
If that is so, they do not give the people a single date-spot.
Or are they jealous of the people for the bounty that God has given them?
Yet We gave the people of Abraham the Book and the Wisdom, and We gave them a mighty kingdom.
And some of them there are that believe, and some of them that bar from it; Gehenna suffices for a Blaze!
Surely those who disbelieve in Our signs -- We shall certainly roast them at a Fire; as often as their skins are wholly burned, We shall give them in exchange other skins, that they may taste the chastisement.
Surely God is All-mighty, All-wise.
And those that believe, and do deeds of righteousness, them We shall admit to gardens underneath which rivers flow, therein dwelling forever and ever; therein for them shall be spouses purified, and We shall admit them to a shelter of plenteous shade.
God commands you to deliver trusts back to their owners; and when you judge between the people, that you judge with justice.
Good is the admonition God gives you; God is All-hearing, All-seeing.
O believers, obey God, and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you.
If you should quarrel on anything, refer it to God and the Messenger, if you believe in God and the Last Day; that is better, and fairer in the issue.
Hast thou not regarded those who assert that they believe in what has been sent down to thee, and what was sent down before thee, desiring to take their disputes to idols, yet they have been commanded to disbelieve in them? But Satan desires to lead them astray into far error.
And when it is said to them, 'Come now to what God has sent down, and the Messenger,' then thou seest the hypocrites barring the way to thee.
How shall it be, when they are visited by an affliction for what their own hands have forwarded, then they come to thee swearing by God, 'We sought only kindness and conciliation'?
Those -- God knows what is in their hearts; so turn away from them, and admonish them, and say to them penetrating words about themselves.
We sent not ever any Messenger, but that he should he obeyed, by the leave of God.
If; when they wronged themselves, they had come to thee, and prayed forgiveness of God, and the Messenger had prayed forgiveness for them, they would have found God turns, All-compassionate.
But no, by thy Lord! they will not believe till they make thee the judge regarding the disagreement between them, then they shall find in themselves no impediment touching thy verdict, but shall surrender in full submission.
But had We prescribed for them, saying, 'Slay yourselves' or 'Leave your habitations,' they would not have done it, save a few of them; yet if they had done as they were admonished it would have been better for them, and stronger confirming them,
and then We surely would have given them from Us a mighty wage,
and guided them on a straight path.
Whosoever obeys God, and the Messenger -- they are with those whom God has blessed, Prophets, just men, martyrs, the righteous; good companions they!
That is the bounty from God; God suffices as One who knows.
O believers, take your precautions; then move forward in companies, or move forward all together.
Some of you there are that are dilatory; then, if an affliction visits you, he says, 'God has blessed me, in that I was not a martyr with them.'
But if a bounty from God visits you, he will surely say, as if there had never been any affection between you and him, 'Would that I had been with them, to attain a mighty triumph!'
So let them fight in the way of God who sell the present life for the world to come; and whosoever fights in the way of God and is slain, or conquers, We shall bring him a mighty wage.
How is it with you, that you do not fight in the way of God, and for the men, women, and children who, being abased, say, 'Our Lord, bring us forth from this city whose people are evildoers, and appoint t us a protector from Thee, and appoint to us from Thee a helper'?
The believers fight in the way of God, and the unbelievers fight in the idols' way. Fight you therefore against the friends of Satan; surely the guile of Satan is ever feeble.
Hast thou not regarded those to whom it was said, 'Restrain your hands, and perform the prayer, and pay the alms'?
Then, as soon as fighting is prescribed for them, there is a party of them fearing the people as they would fear God, or with a greater fear, and they say, 'Our Lord, why hast thou prescribed fighting for us?
Why not defer us to a near term?'
Say: 'The enjoyment of this world is little; the world to come is better for him who fears God; you shall not be wronged a single date-thread.'
Wherever you may be, death will overtake you, though you should be in raised-up towers.
And if a good thing visits them, they say, 'This is from God'; but if an evil thing visits them, they say, 'This is from thee.'
Say: 'Everything is from God.'
How is it with this people? They scarcely understand any tiding.
Whatever good visits thee, it is of God; whatever evil visits thee is of thyself.
And We have sent thee to men a Messenger; God suffices for a witness.
Whosoever obeys the Messenger, thereby obeys God; and whosoever turns his back - We have not sent thee to be a watcher over them.
They say, 'Obedience'; but when they sally forth from thee, a party of them meditate all night on other than what thou sayest.
God writes down their meditations; so turn away from them, and put thy trust in God; God suffices for a guardian.
What, do they not ponder the Koran?
If it had been from other than God surely they would have found in it much inconsistency.
When there comes to them a matter, be it of security or fear, they broadcast it; if they had referred it to the Messenger and to those in authority among them, those of them whose task it is to investigate would have known the matter.
And but for the bounty of God to you, and His mercy, you would surely have followed Satan, except a few.
So do thou fight in the way of God; thou art charged only with thyself.
And urge on the believers; haply God will restrain the unbelievers' might; God is stronger in might, more terrible in punishing.
Whoso intercedes with a good intercession shall receive a share of it; whosoever intercedes with a bad intercession, he shall receive the like of it; God has power over everything.
And when you are greeted with a greeting greet with a fairer than it, or return it; surely God keeps a watchful count over everything.
God -- there is no god but He.
He will surely gather you to the Resurrection Day, no doubt of it.
And who is truer in tidings than God?
How is it with you, that you are two parties touching the hypocrites, and God has overthrown them for what they earned?
What, do you desire to guide him whom God has led astray?
Whom God leads astray, thou wilt not find for him a way.
They wish that you should disbelieve as they disbelieve, and then you would be equal; therefore take not to yourselves friends of them, until they emigrate in the way of God; then, if they turn their backs, take them, and slay them wherever you find them; take not to yourselves any one of them as friend or helper
except those that betake themselves to a people who are joined with you by a compact, or come to you with breasts constricted from fighting with you or fighting their people.
Had God willed, He would have given them authority over you, and then certainly they would have fought you.
If they withdraw from you, and do not fight you, and offer you peace, then God assigns not any way to you against them.
You will find others desiring to be secure from you, and secure from their people, yet whenever they are returned to temptation, they are overthrown in it.
If they withdraw not from you, and offer you peace, and restrain their hands, take them, and slay them wherever you come on them; against them We have given you a clear authority.
It belongs not to a believer to slay a believer, except it be by error.
If any slays a believer by error, then let him set free a believing slave, and bloodwit is to be paid to his family unless they forgo it as a freewill offering.
If he belong to a people at enmity with you and is a believer, let the slayer set free a believing slave. If he belong to a people joined with you by a compact, then bloodwit is to be paid to his family and the slayer shall set free a believing slave.
But if he finds not the means, let him fast two successive months -- God's turning; God is All-knowing, All-wise.
And whoso slays a believer wilfully, his recompense is Gehenna, therein dwelling forever, and God will be wroth with him and will curse him, and prepare for him a mighty chastisement.
O believers, when you are journeying in the path of God, be discriminating, and do not say to him who offers you a greeting, 'Thou art not a believer,' seeking the chance goods of the present life. With God are spoils abundant.
So you were aforetime; but God has been gracious to you. So be discriminating; surely God is aware of the things you do.
Such believers as sit at home -- unless they have an injury -- are not the equals of those who struggle in the path of God with their possessions and their selves.
God has preferred in rank those who struggle with their possessions and their selves over the ones who sit at home; yet to each God has promised the reward most fair; and God has preferred those who struggle over the ones who sit at home for the bounty of a mighty wage,
in ranks standing before Him, forgiveness and mercy; surely God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
And those the angels take, while still they are wronging themselves -- the angels will say, 'In what circumstances were you?'
They will say, 'We were abased in the earth.'
The angels will say, 'But was not God's earth wide, so that you might have emigrated in it?'
Such men, their refuge shall be Gehenna -- an evil homecoming! --
except the men, women, and children who, being abased, can devise nothing and are not guided to a way;
haply them God will yet pardon, for God is All-pardoning, All-forgiving.
Whoso emigrates in the way of God will find in the earth many refuges and plenty; whoso goes forth from his house an emigrant to God and His Messenger, and then death overtakes him, his wage shall have fallen on God; surely God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
And when you are journeying in the land there is no fault in you that you shorten the prayer, if you fear the unbelievers may afflict you; the unbelievers are for you a manifest foe.
When thou art amongst them, and performest for them the prayer, let a party of them stand with thee, and let them take their weapons.
When they bow themselves, let them be behind you; and let another party who have not prayed come and pray with thee, taking their precautions and their weapons.
The unbelievers wish that you should be heedless of your weapons and your baggage, then they would wheel on you all at once.
There is no fault in you, if rain molests you, or you are sick, to lay aside your weapons; but take your precautions.
God has prepared for the unbelievers a humbling chastisement.
When you have performed the prayer, remember God, standing and sitting and on your sides.
Then, when you are secure, perform the prayer; surely the prayer is a timed prescription for the believers.
Faint not in seeking the heathen; if you are suffering, they are also suffering as you are suffering, and you are hoping from God for that for which they cannot hope; God is All-knowing, All-wise.
Surely We have sent down to thee the Book with the truth, so that thou mayest judge between the people by that God has shown thee.
So be not an advocate for the traitors;
and pray forgiveness of God; surely God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
And do not dispute on behalf of those who betray themselves; surely God loves not the guilty traitor.
They hide themselves from men, but hide not themselves from God; for He is with them while they meditate at night discourse unpleasing to Him; God encompasses the things they do.
Ha, there you are; you have disputed on their behalf in the present life; but who will dispute with God on their behalf on the Resurrection Day, or who will be a guardian for them?
Whosoever does evil, or wrongs himself; and then prays God's forgiveness, he shall find God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
And whosoever earns a sin, earns it against himself only; and God is ever All-knowing, All-wise.
And whosoever earns a fault or a sin and then casts it upon the innocent, thereby has laid upon himself calumny and manifest sin.
But for God's bounty to thee and His mercy a party of them purposed to lead thee astray; but they lead only themselves astray; they do not hurt thee in anything. God has sent down on thee the Book and the Wisdom, and He has taught thee that thou knewest not; God's' bounty to thee is ever great.
No good is there in much of their conspiring, except for him who bids to freewill offering, or honour, or setting things right between the people.
Whoso does that, seeking God's good pleasure, We shall surely give him a mighty wage.
But whoso makes a breach with the Messenger after the guidance has become clear to him and follows a way other than the believers', him We shall turn over to what he has turned to and We shall roast him in Gehenna - an evil homecoming!
God forgives not that aught should be with Him associated; less than that He forgives to whomsoever He will.
Whoso associates with God anything, has gone astray into far error.
In stead of Him, they pray not except to female beings; they pray not except to a rebel Satan accursed by God.
He said, 'Assuredly I will take unto myself a portion appointed of Thy servants,
and I will lead them astray, and fill them with fancies and I will command them and they will cut off the cattle's ears; I will command them and they will alter God's creation.'
Whoso takes Satan to him for a friend, instead of God, has surely suffered a manifest loss.
He promises them and fills them with fancies, but there is nothing Satan promises them except delusion.
Such men -- their refuge shall be Gehenna, and they shall find no asylum from it.
But those that believe, and do deeds of righteousness, them We shall admit to gardens underneath which rivers flow, therein dwelling for ever and ever; God's promise in truth; and who is truer in speech than God?
It is not your fancies, nor the fancies of the People of the Book.
Whosoever does evil shall be recompensed for it, and will not find for him, apart from God, a friend or helper.
And whosoever does deeds of righteousness, be it male or female, believing - they shall enter Paradise, and not be wronged a single date-spot.
And who is there that has a fairer religion than he who submits his will to God being a good-doer, and who follows the creed of Abraham, a man of pure faith?
And God took Abraham for a friend.
To God belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth, and God encompasses everything.
They will ask thee for a pronouncement concerning women.
Say: 'God pronounces to you concerning them, and what is recited to you in the Book concerning the orphan women to whom you give not what is prescribed for them, and yet desire to marry them, and the oppressed children, and that you secure justice for orphans.
Whatever good you do, God knows of it.'
If a woman fear rebelliousness or aversion in her husband, there is no fault in them if the couple set things right between them; right settlement is better; and souls are very prone to avarice.
If you do good and are godfearing, surely God is aware of the things you do.
You will not be able to be equitable between your wives, be you ever so eager; yet do not be altogether partial so that you leave her as it were suspended.
If you set things right, and are godfearing, God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
But if they separate, God will enrich each of them of His plenty; God is All-embracing, All-wise.
To God belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth.
We have charged those who were given the Book before you, and you, 'Fear God.'
If you disbelieve, to God belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth; God is All-sufficient, All-laudable.
To God belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth; God suffices for a guardian.
If He will, He can put you away, O men, and bring others; surely God is powerful over that.
Whoso desires the reward of this world, with God is the reward of this world and of the world to come; God is All-hearing, All-seeing.
O believers, be you securers of justice, witnesses for God, even though it be against yourselves, or your parents and kinsmen, whether the man be rich or poor; God stands closest to either.
Then follow not caprice, so as to swerve; for if you twist or turn, God is aware of the things you do.
O believers, believe in God and His Messenger and the Book He has sent down on His Messenger and the Book which He sent down before.
Whoso disbelieves in God and His angels and His Books, and His Messengers, and the Last Day, has surely gone astray into far error.
Those who believe, and then disbelieve, and then believe, and then disbelieve, and then increase in unbelief-God is not likely to forgive them, neither to guide them on any way.
Give thou good tidings to the hypocrites that for them awaits a painful chastisement.
Those who take unbelievers for their friends instead of believers -- do they seek glory in them?
But glory altogether belongs to God.
He has sent down upon you in the Book: 'When you hear God's signs being disbelieved and made mock of, do not sit with them until they plunge into some other talk, or else you will surely be like to them.'
God will gather the hypocrites and the unbelievers all in Gehenna.
Those who wait upon you and, if a victory comes to you from God, say, 'Were we not with you?' but if the unbelievers get a share, they say, 'Did we not gain the mastery over you, and did we not defend you from the believers?'
God will judge between you on the Resurrection Day, and God will not grant the unbelievers any way over the believers.
The hypocrites seek to trick God, but God is tricking them.
When they stand up to pray they stand up lazily, showing off to the people and not remembering God save a little;
wavering all the time -- not to these, not to those; and whom God leads astray, thou wilt not find for him a way.
O believers, take not the unbelievers as friends instead of the believers; or do you desire to give God over you a clear authority?
Surely the hypocrites will be in the lowest reach of the Fire; thou wilt not find for them any helper;
save such as repent, and make amends, and hold fast to God, and make their religion sincerely God's; those are with the believers, and God will certainly give the believers a mighty wage.
What would God do with chastising you if you are thankful, and believe?
God is All-thankful, All-knowing.
God likes not the shouting of evil words unless a man has been wronged; God is All-hearing, All-knowing.
If you do good openly or in secret or pardon an evil, surely God is All-pardoning, All-powerful.
Those who disbelieve in God and His Messengers and desire to make division between God and His Messengers, and say, 'We believe in part, and disbelieve in part,' desiring to take between this and that a way --
those in truth are the unbelievers; and We have prepared for the unbelievers a humbling chastisement.
And those who believe in God and His Messengers and make no division between any of them, those -- We shall surely give them their wages; God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
The People of the Book will ask thee to bring down upon them a Book from heaven; and they asked Moses for greater than that, for they said, 'Show us God openly.'
And the thunderbolt took them for their evildoing.
Then they took to themselves the Calf, after the clear signs had come to them; yet We pardoned them that, and We bestowed upon Moses a clear authority.
And We raised above them the Mount, taking compact with them; and We said to them, 'Enter in at the gate, prostrating'; and We said to them, 'Transgress not the Sabbath'; and We took from them a solemn compact.
So, for their breaking the compact, and disbelieving in the signs of God, and slaying the Prophets without right, and for their saying, 'Our hearts are uncircumcised' -- nay, but God sealed them for their unbelief, so they believe not, except a few --
and for their unbelief, and their uttering against Mary a mighty calumny,
and for their saying, 'We slew the Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, the Messenger of God' -- yet they did not slay him, neither crucified him, only a likeness of that was shown to them. Those who are at variance concerning him surely are in doubt regarding him; they have no knowledge of him, except the following of surmise; and they slew him not of a certainty -- no indeed;
God raised him up to Him; God is All-mighty, All-wise.
There is not one of the People of the Book but will assuredly believe in him before his death, and on the Resurrection Day he will be a witness against them.
And for the evildoing of those of Jewry, We have forbidden them certain good things that were permitted to them, and for their barring from God's way many,
and for their taking usury, that they were prohibited, and consuming the wealth of the people in vanity; and We have prepared for the unbelievers among them a painful chastisement.
But those of them that are firmly rooted in knowledge, and the believers believing in what has been sent down to thee, and what was sent down before thee, that perform the prayer and pay the alms, and those who believe in God and the Last Day - them We shall surely give a mighty wage.
We have revealed to thee as We revealed to Noah, and the Prophets after him, and We revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, Jesus and Job, Jonah and Aaron and Solomon, and We gave to David Psalms,
and Messengers We have already told thee of before, and Messengers We have not told thee of; and unto Moses God spoke directly --
Messengers bearing good tidings, and warning, so that mankind might have no argument against God, after the Messengers; God is All-mighty, All-wise.
But God bears witness to that He has sent down to thee; He has sent it down with His knowledge; and the angels also bear witness; and God suffices for a witness.
Surely those who disbelieve, and bar from the way of God, have gone astray into far error.
Surely the unbelievers, who have done evil, God would not forgive them, neither guide them on any road
but the road to Gehenna, therein dwelling forever and ever; and that for God is an easy matter.
O men, the Messenger has now come to you with the truth from your Lord; so believe; better is it for you.
And if you disbelieve, to God belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth; and God is All-knowing, All-wise.
People of the Book, go not beyond the bounds in your religion, and say not as to God but the truth.
The Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, was only the Messenger of God, and His Word that He committed to Mary, and a Spirit from Him.
So believe in God and His Messengers, and say not, 'Three.'
Refrain; better is it for you.
God is only One God.
Glory be to Him -- That He should have a son!
To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth; God suffices for a guardian.
The Messiah will not disdain to be a servant of God, neither the angels who are near stationed to Him. Whosoever disdains to serve Him, and waxes proud, He will assuredly muster them to Him, all of them.
As for the believers, who do deeds of righteousness, He will pay them in full their wages, and He will give them more, of His bounty; and as for them who disdain, and wax proud, them He will chastise with a painful chastisement, and they shall not find for them, apart from God, a friend or helper.
O men, a proof has now come to you from your Lord; We have sent down to you a manifest light.
As for those who believe in God, and hold fast to Him, He will surely admit them to mercy from Him, and bounty, and will guide them to Him on a straight path.
They will ask thee for a pronouncement.
Say: 'God pronounces to you concerning the indirect heirs. If a man perishes having no children, but he has a sister, she shall receive a half of what he leaves, and he is her heir if she has no children.
If there be two sisters, they shall receive two-thirds of what he leaves; if there be brothers and sisters, the male shall receive the portion of two females.
God makes clear to you, lest you go astray; God has knowledge of everything.
O believers, fulfil your bonds.
Permitted to you is the beast of the flocks, except that which is now recited to you, so that you deem not game permitted to be hunted when you are in pilgrim sanctity. God decrees whatsoever He desires.
O believers, profane not God's waymarks nor the holy month, neither the offering, nor the necklaces, nor those repairing to the Holy House seeking from their Lord bounty and good pleasure.
But when you have quit your pilgrim sanctity, then hunt for game. Let not detestation for a people who barred you from the Holy Mosque move you to commit aggression.
Help one another to piety and godfearing; do not help each other to sin and enmity.
And fear God; surely God is terrible in retribution.
Forbidden to you are carrion, blood, the flesh of swine, what has been hallowed to other than God, the beast strangled; the beast beaten down, the beast fallen to death, the beast gored, and that devoured by beasts of prey - excepting that you have sacrificed duly -- as also things sacrificed to idols, and partition by the divining arrows; that is ungodliness.
Today the unbelievers have despaired of your religion; therefore fear them not, but fear you Me.
Today I have perfected your religion for you, and I have completed My blessing upon you, and I have approved Islam for your religion.
But whosoever is constrained in emptiness and not inclining purposely to sin -- God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
They will question thee what is permitted them.
Say: 'The good things are permitted you; and such hunting creatures as you teach, training them as hounds, and teaching them as God has taught you -- eat what they seize for you, and mention God's Name over it.
Fear God; God is swift at the reckoning.'
Today the good things are permitted you, and the food of those who were given the Book is permitted to you, and permitted to them is your food; Likewise believing women in wedlock, and in wedlock women of them who were given the Book before you if you give them their wages, in wedlock and not in licence, or as taking lovers.
Whoso disbelieves in the faith, his work has failed, and in the world to come he shall be among the losers.
O believers, when you stand up to pray wash your faces, and your hands up to the elbows, and wipe your heads, and your feet up to the ankles.
If you are defiled, purify yourselves; but if you are sick or on a journey, or if any of you comes from the privy, or you have touched women, and you can find no water, then have recourse to wholesome dust and wipe your faces and your hands with it.
God does not desire to make any impediment for you; but He desires to purify you, and that He may complete His blessing upon you; haply you will be thankful.
And remember God's blessing upon you, and His compact which He made with you when you said, 'We have heard and we obey.
And fear you God; surely God knows the thoughts in the breasts.
O believers, be you securers of justice, witnesses for God.
Let not detestation for a people move you not to be equitable; be equitable -- that is nearer to godfearing.
And fear God; surely God is aware of the things you do.
God has promised those that believe, and do deeds of righteousness; they shall have; forgiveness and a mighty wage.
And the unbelievers, who cried lies to Our signs -- they shall be the inhabitants of Hell.
O believers, remember God's blessing upon you, when a certain people purposed to stretch against you their hands, and He restrained their hands from you; and fear God; and in God let the believers put all their trust.
God took compact with the Children of Israel; and We raised up from among them twelve chieftains.
And God said, 'I am with you. Surely, if you perform the prayer, and pay the alms, and believe in My Messengers and succour them, and lend to God a good loan, I will acquit you of your evil deeds, and I will admit you to gardens underneath which rivers flow.
So whosoever of you thereafter disbelieves, surely he has gone astray from the right way.
So for their breaking their compact We cursed them and made their hearts hard, they perverting words from their meanings; and they have forgotten a portion of that they were reminded of; and thou wilt never cease to light upon some act of treachery on their part, except a few of them. Yet pardon them, and forgive; surely God loves the good-doers.
And with those who say 'We are Christians' We took compact; and they have forgotten a portion of that they were reminded of.
So We have stirred up among them enmity and hatred, till the Day of Resurrection; and God will assuredly tell them of the things they wrought.
People of the Book, now there has come to you Our Messenger, making clear to you many things you have been concealing of the Book, and effacing many things.
There has come to you from God a light, and a Book Manifest
whereby God guides whosoever follows His good pleasure in the ways of peace, and brings them forth from the shadows into the light by His leave; and He guides them to a straight path.
They are unbelievers who say, 'God is the Messiah, Mary's son.'
Say: 'Who then shall overrule God in any way if He desires to destroy the Messiah, Mary's son, and his mother, and all those who are on earth?'
For to God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth, and all that is between them, creating what He will.
God is powerful over everything.
Say the Jews and Christians, 'We are the sons of God, and His beloved ones.'
Say: 'Why then does He chastise you for your sins?
No; you are mortals, of His creating; He forgives whom He will, and He chastises whom He will.'
For to God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth, and all that is between them; to Him is the homecoming.
People of the Book, now there has come to you Our Messenger, making things clear to you, upon an interval between the Messengers lest you should say, 'There has not come to us any bearer of good tidings, neither any warner.
Indeed, there has come to you a bearer of good tidings and a warner; God is powerful over everything.
And when Moses said to his people, 'O my people, remember God's blessing upon you, when He appointed among you Prophets, and appointed you kings, and gave you such as He had not given to any being.
O my people, enter the Holy Land which God has prescribed for you, and turn not back in your traces, to turn about losers.'
They said, 'Moses, there are people in. it very arrogant; we will not enter it until they depart from it; if they depart from it then we will enter.'
Said two men of those that feared God whom God had blessed, 'Enter against them the gate! When you enter it, you will be victors.
Put you all your trust in God, if you are believers.'
They said, 'Moses, we will never enter it so long as they are in it.
Go forth, thou and thy Lord, and do battle; we will be sitting here.'
He said, 'O my Lord, I rule no one except myself and my brother. So do Thou divide between us and the people of the ungodly.'
Said He, 'Then it shall be forbidden them for forty years, while they are wandering in the earth; so grieve not for the people of the ungodly.'
And recite thou to them the story of the two sons of Adam truthfully, when they offered a sacrifice, and it was accepted of one of them, and not accepted of the other.
'I will surely slay thee,' said one.
'God accepts only of the godfearing,' said the other.
'Yet if thou stretchest out thy hand against me, to slay me, I will not stretch out my hand against thee, to slay thee; I fear God, the Lord of all Being.
I desire that thou shouldest be laden with my sin and thy sin, and so become an inhabitant of the Fire; that is the recompense of the evildoers.'
Then his soul prompted him to slay his brother, and he slew him, and became one of the losers.
Then God sent forth a raven, scratching into the earth, to show him how he might conceal the vile body of his brother.
He said, 'Woe is me!
Am I unable to be as this raven, and so conceal my brother's vile body?'
And he became one of the remorseful.
Therefore We prescribed for the Children of Israel that whoso slays a soul not to retaliate for a soul slain, nor for corruption done in the land, shall be as if he had slain mankind altogether; and whoso gives life to a soul, shall be as if he ha given life to mankind altogether.
Our Messengers have already come to them with the clear signs; then many of them thereafter commit excesses in the earth.
This is the recompense of those who fight against God and His Messenger, and hasten about the earth, to do corruption there: they shall be slaughtered, or crucified, or their hands and feet shall alternately be struck off; or they shall be banished from the land.
That is a degradation for them in this world; and in the world to come awaits them a mighty chastisement,
except for such as repent, before you have power over them.
So know you that God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
O believers, fear God, and seek the means to come to Him, and struggle in His way; haply you will prosper.
The unbelievers, though they possessed all that is in the earth, and the like of it with it, to ransom themselves from the chastisement of the Day of Resurrection thereby, it would not be accepted of them; for them awaits a painful chastisement.
They will desire to come forth from the Fire, but they will not come forth from it; for them awaits a lasting chastisement.
And the thief, male and female: cut off the hands of both, as a recompense for what they have earned, and a punishment exemplary from God; God is All-mighty, All-wise.
But whoso repents, after his evildoing, and makes amends, God will turn towards him; God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
Knowest thou not that to God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth?
He chastises whom He will, and forgives whom He will; and God is powerful over everything.
O Messenger, let them not grieve thee that vie with one another in unbelief, such men as say with their mouths 'We believe' but their hearts believe not; and the Jews who listen to falsehood, listen to other folk, who have not come to thee, perverting words from their meanings, saying, 'If you are given this, then take it; if you are not given it, beware!'
Whomsoever God desires to try, thou canst not avail him anything with God.
Those are they whose hearts God desired not to purify; for them is degradation in this world; and in the world to come awaits them a mighty chastisement;
who listen to falsehood, and consume the unlawful.
If they come to thee, judge thou between them, or turn away from them; if thou turnest away from them, they will hurt thee nothing; and if thou judgest, judge justly between them; God loves the just.
Yet how will they make thee their judge seeing they have the Torah, wherein is God's judgment, then thereafter turn their backs? They are not believers.
Surely We sent down the Torah, wherein is guidance and light; thereby the Prophets who had surrendered themselves gave judgment for those of Jewry, as did the masters and the rabbis, following such portion of God's Book as they were given to keep and were witnesses to.
So fear not men, but fear you Me; and sell not My signs for a little price.
Whoso judges not according to what God has sent down - they are the unbelievers.
And therein We prescribed for them: 'A life for a life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear, a tooth for a tooth, and for wounds retaliation'; but whosoever forgoes it as a freewill offering, that shall be for him an expiation. Whoso judges not according to what God has sent down -- they are the evildoers.
And We sent, following in their footsteps, Jesus son of Mary, confirming the Torah before him and We gave to him the Gospel, wherein is guidance and light, and confirming the Torah before it, as a guidance and an admonition unto the godfearing.
So let the People of the Gospel judge according to what God has sent down therein. Whosoever judges not according to what God has sent down -- they are the ungodly.
And We have sent down to thee the Book with the truth, confirming the Book that was before it, and assuring it. So judge between them according to what God has sent down, and do not follow their caprices, to forsake the truth that has come to thee.
To every one of you We have appointed a right way and an open road.
If God had willed, He would have made you one nation; but that He may try you in what has come to you.
So be you forward in good works; unto God shall you return, all together; and He will tell you of that whereon you were at variance.
And judge between them according to what God has sent down, and do not follow their caprices, and beware of them lest they tempt thee away from any of what God has sent down to thee.
But if they turn their backs, know that God desires only to smite them for some sin they have committed; surely, many men are ungodly.
Is it the judgment of pagandom then that they are seeking?
Yet who is fairer in judgment than God, for a people having sure faith?
O believers, take not Jews and Christians as friends; they are friends of each other.
Whoso of you makes them his friends is one of them.
God guides not the people of the evildoers.
Yet thou seest those in whose hearts is sickness vying with one another to come to them, saying, 'We fear lest a turn of fortune should smite us.'
But it may be that God will bring the victory, or some commandment from Him, and then they will find themselves, for that they kept secret within them, remorseful,
and the believers will say, 'What, are these the ones who swore by God most earnest oaths that they were with you?
Their works have failed now they are losers.'
O believers, whosoever of you turns from his religion, God will assuredly bring a people He loves, and who love Him, humble towards the believers, disdainful towards the unbelievers, men who struggle in the path of God, not fearing the reproach of any reproacher.
That is God's bounty; He gives it unto whom He will; and God is All-embracing, All-knowing.
Your friend is only God, and His Messenger, and the believers who perform the prayer and pay the alms, and bow them down.
Whoso makes God his friend, and His Messenger, and the believers -- the party of God, they are the victors.
O believers, take not as your friends those of them, who were given the Book before you, and the unbelievers, who take your religion in mockery and as a sport -- and fear God, if you are believers --
and when you call to prayer, take it in mockery and as a sport; that is because they are a people who have no understanding.
Say: 'People of the Book, do you blame us for any other cause than that we believe in God, and what has been sent down to us, and what was sent down before, and that most of you are ungodly?'
Say: 'Shall I tell you of a recompense with God, worse than that?
Whomsoever God has cursed, and with whom He is wroth, and made some of them apes and swine, and worshippers of idols -- they are worse situated, and have gone further astray from the right way.
When they come to you, they say, 'We believe'; but they have entered in unbelief, and so they have departed in it; God knows very well what they were hiding.
Thou seest many of them vying in sin and enmity, and how they consume the unlawful; evil is the thing they have been doing.
Why do the masters and the rabbis not forbid them to utter sin, and consume the unlawful?
Evil is the thing they have been working.
The Jews have said, 'God's hand is fettered.'
Fettered are their hands, and they are cursed for what they have said.
Nay, but His hands are outspread; He expends how He will.
And what has been sent down to thee from thy Lord will surely increase many of them in insolence and unbelief; and We have cast between them enmity and hatred, till the Day of Resurrection.
As often as they light a fire for war, God will extinguish it. They hasten about the earth, to do corruption there; and God loves not the workers of corruption.
But had the People of the Book believed and been godfearing, We would have acquitted them of their evil deeds, and admitted them to Gardens of Bliss.
Had they performed the Torah and the Gospel, and what was sent down to them from their Lord, they would have. eaten both what was above them, and what was beneath their feet.
Some of them are a just nation; but many of them -- evil are the things they do.
O Messenger, deliver that which has been sent down to thee from thy Lord; for if thou dost not, thou wilt not have delivered His Message.
God will protect thee from men.
God guides not the people of the unbelievers.
Say: 'People of the Book, you do not stand on anything, until you perform the Torah and the Gospel, and what was sent down to you from your Lord.'
And what has been sent down to thee from thy Lord will surely increase many of them in insolence and unbelief; so grieve not for the people of the unbelievers.
Surely they that believe, and those of Jewry, and the Sabaeans, and those Christians, whosoever believes in God and the Last Day, and works righteousness -- no fear shall be on them, neither shall they sorrow.
And We took compact with the Children of Israel, and We sent Messengers to them.
Whensoever there came to them a Messenger with that their souls had not desire for, some they cried lies to, and some they slew.
And they supposed there should be no trial; but blind they were, and deaf.
Then God turned towards them; then again blind they were, many of them, and deaf; and God sees the things they do.
They are unbelievers who say, 'God is the Messiah, Mary's son.' For the Messiah said, 'Children of Israel, serve God, my Lord and your Lord.
Verily whoso associates with God anything, God shall prohibit him entrance to Paradise, and his refuge shall be the Fire; and wrongdoers shall have no helpers.'
They are unbelievers who say, 'God is the Third of Three. No god is there but One God.
If they refrain not from what they say, there shall afflict those of them that disbelieve a painful chastisement.
Will they not turn to God and pray His forgiveness?
God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
The Messiah, son of Mary, was only a Messenger; Messengers before him passed away; his mother was a just woman; they both ate food.
Behold, how We make clear the signs to them; then behold, how they perverted are!
Say: 'Do you serve, apart from God, that which cannot hurt or profit you?
God is the All-hearing, the All-knowing.'
Say: 'People of the Book, go not beyond the bounds in your religion, other than the truth, and follow not the caprices of a people who went astray before, and led astray many, and now again have gone astray from the right way.'
Cursed were the unbelievers of the Children of Israel by the tongue of David, and Jesus, Mary's son; that, for their rebelling and their transgression.
They forbade not one another any dishonour that they committed; surely evil were the things they did.
Thou seest many of them making unbelievers their friends.
Evil is that they have forwarded to their account, that God is angered against them, and in the chastisement they shall dwell forever.
Yet had they believed in God and the Prophet and what has been sent down to him, they would not have taken them as friends; but many of them are ungodly.
Thou wilt surely find the most hostile of men to the believers are the Jews and the idolaters; and thou wilt surely find the nearest of them in love to the believers are those who say 'We are Christians'; that, because some of them are priests and monks, and they wax not proud;
and when they hear what has been sent down to the Messenger, thou seest their eyes overflow with tears because of the truth they recognize.
They say, 'Our Lord, we believe; so do Thou write us down among the witnesses.
Why should we not believe in God and the truth that has come to us, and be eager that our Lord should admit us with the righteous people?'
And God rewards them for what they say with gardens underneath which rivers flow, therein dwelling forever; that is the recompense of the good-doers.
But those who disbelieve, and cry lies to Our signs -- they are the inhabitants of Hell.
O believers, forbid not such good things as God has permitted you; and transgress not; God loves not transgressors.
Eat of what God has provided you lawful and good; and fear God, in whom you are believers.
God will not take you to task for a slip in your oaths; but He will take you to task for such bonds as you have made by oaths, whereof the expiation is to feed ten poor persons with the average of the food you serve to your families, or to clothe them, or to set free a slave; or if any finds not the means, let him fast for three days.
That is the expiation of your oaths when you have sworn; but keep your oaths.
So God makes clear to you His signs; haply you will be thankful.
O believers, wine and arrow-shuffling, idols and divining-arrows are an abomination, some of Satan's work; so avoid it; haply So you will prosper.
Satan only desires to precipitate enmity and hatred between you in regard to wine and arrow-shuffling, and to bar you from the remembrance of God, and from prayer.
Will you then desist?
And obey God and obey the Messenger, and beware; but if you turn your backs, then know that it is only for Our Messenger to deliver the Message Manifest.
There is no fault in those who believe and do deeds of righteousness what they may eat, if they are godfearing, and believe, and do deeds of righteousness, and then are godfearing and believe, and then are godfearing and do good; God loves the good-doers.
O believers, God will surely try you with something of the game that your hands and lances attain, that God may know who fears Him in the Unseen.
Whoso thereafter commits transgression, there awaits him a painful chastisement.
O believers, slay not the game while you are in pilgrim sanctity; whosoever of you slays it wilfully, there shall be recompense -- the like of what he has slain, in flocks as shall be judged by two men of equity among you, an offering to reach the Kaaba; or expiation -- food for poor persons or the equivalent of that in fasting, so that he may taste the mischief of his action. God has pardoned what is past; but whoever offends again, God will take vengeance on him, God is All-mighty, Vengeful.
Permitted to you is the game of the sea and the food of it, as a provision for you and for the journeyers; but forbidden to you is the game of the land, so long as you remain in pilgrim sanctity; and fear God, unto whom you shall be mustered.
God has appointed the Kaaba, the Holy House, as an establishment for men, and the holy month; the offering, and the necklaces -- that, that you may know that God knows all that is in the heavens and in the earth; and that God has knowledge of everything.
Know God is terrible in retribution, and God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
It is only for the Messenger to deliver the Message; and God knows what you reveal and what you hide.
Say: 'The corrupt and the good are not equal, though the abundance of the corrupt please thee.'
So fear God, O men possessed of minds; haply so you will prosper.
O believers, question not concerning things which, if they were revealed to you, would vex you; yet if you question concerning them when the Koran is being sent down, they will be revealed to you.
God has effaced those things; for God is All-forgiving, All-clement.
A people before you questioned concerning them, then disbelieved in them.
God has not appointed cattle dedicated to idols, such as Bahira, Sa'iba, Wasila, Hami; but the unbelievers forge against God falsehood, and most of them have no understanding.
And when it is said to them, 'Come now to what God has sent down, and the Messenger, they say, 'Enough for us is what we found our fathers doing.'
What, even if their fathers had knowledge of naught and were not guided?
O believers, look after your own souls.
He who is astray cannot hurt you, if you are rightly guided.
Unto God shall you return, all together, and He will tell you what you were doing.
O believers, the testimony between you when any of you is visited by death, at the bequeathing, shall be two men of equity among you; or two others from another folk, if you are journeying in the land and the affliction of death befalls you.
Them you shall detain after the prayer, and they shall swear by God, if you are doubtful, 'We will not sell it for a price, even though it were a near kinsman, nor will we hide the testimony of God, for then we would surely be among the sinful'
But if it be discovered that both of them have merited the accusation of any sin, then two others shall stand in their place, these being the nearest of those most concerned, and they shall swear by God, 'Our testimony is truer than their testimony, and we have not transgressed, for then we would assuredly be among the evildoers.'
So it is likelier that they will bear testimony in proper form, or else they will be afraid that after their oaths, oaths may be rebutted.
Fear God, and hearken; God guides not the people of the ungodly.
The day when God shall gather the Messengers, and say, 'What answer were you given?' They shall say, 'We have no knowledge; Thou art the Knower of the things unseen.
When God said, 'Jesus Son of Mary, remember My blessing upon thee and upon thy mother, when I confirmed thee with the Holy Spirit, to speak to men in the cradle, and of age; and when I taught thee the Book, the Wisdom, the Torah, the Gospel; and when thou createst out of clay, by My leave, as the likeness of a bird, and thou breathest into it, and it is a bird, by My leave; and thou healest the blind and the leper by My leave, and thou bringest the dead forth by My leave; and when restrained from thee the Children of Israel when thou camest unto them with the clear signs, and the unbelievers among them said, "This is nothing but sorcery manifest."
And when I inspired the Apostles: "Believe in Me and My Messenger"; they said, "We believe; witness Thou our submission."'
And when the Apostles said, 'O Jesus son of Mary, is thy Lord able to send down on us a Table out of heaven?' He said, 'Fear you God, if you are believers.
They said, 'We desire that we should eat of it and our hearts be at rest; and that we may know that thou hast spoken true to us, and that we may be among its witnesses.'
Said Jesus son of Mary, 'O God, our Lord, send down upon us a Table out of heaven, that shall be for us a festival, the first and last of us, and a sign from Thee. And provide for us; Thou art the best of providers.'
God said, 'Verily I do send it down on you; whoso of you hereafter disbelieves, verily I shall chastise him with a chastisement wherewith I chastise no other being.'
And when God said, 'O Jesus son of Mary, didst thou say unto men, "Take me and my mother as gods, apart from God"?'
He said, 'To Thee be glory!
It is not mine to say what I have no right to.
If I indeed said it, Thou knowest it, knowing what is within my soul, and I know not what is within Thy soul; Thou knowest the things unseen
I only said to them what Thou didst command me: "Serve God, my Lord and your Lord."
And I was a witness over them, while I remained among them; but when Thou didst take me to Thyself, Thou wast Thyself the watcher over them; Thou Thyself art witness of everything.
If Thou chastisest them, they are Thy servants; if Thou forgivest them, Thou art the All-mighty, the All-wise.'
God said, 'This is the day the truthful shall be profited by their truthfulness.
For them await gardens underneath which rivers flow, therein dwelling forever and ever; God being well-pleased with them and they well-pleased with Him; that is the mighty triumph.'
To God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth, and all that is in them, and He is powerful over everything.
Praise belongs to God who created the heavens and the earth and appointed the shadows and light; then the unbelievers ascribe equals to their Lord.
It is He who created you of clay, then determined a term and a term is stated with Him; yet thereafter you doubt.
He is God in the heavens and the earth; He knows your secrets, and what you publish, and He knows what you are earning.
Not a sign of their Lord comes to them, but they turn away from it.
They cried lies to the truth when it came to them, but there shall come to them news of that they were mocking.
Have they not regarded how We destroyed before them many a generation We established in the earth, as We never established you, and how We loosed heaven upon them in torrents, and made the rivers to flow beneath them? Then We destroyed them because of their sins, and raised up after them another generation;
Had We sent down on thee a Book on parchment and so they touched it with their hands, yet the unbelievers would have said, 'This is naught but manifest sorcery.'
'Why has an angel not been sent down on him?' they say; yet had We sent down an angel, the matter would have been determined, and then no respite would be given them.
And had We made him an angel, yet assuredly We would have made him a man, and confused for them the thing which they themselves are confusing.
Messengers indeed were mocked at before thee; but those that scoffed at them were encompassed by that they mocked at.
Say: 'Journey in the land, then behold how was the end of them that cried lies.'
Say: 'To whom belongs what is in the heavens and in the earth?'
Say: 'It is God's.
He has prescribed for Himself mercy.
He will surely gather you to the Resurrection Day, of which is no doubt.
Those who have lost their souls, they do not believe.
And to Him belongs whatsoever inhabits the night and the day; and He is the All-hearing, the All-knowing.'
Say: 'Shall I take to myself as protector other than God, the Originator of the heavens and of the earth, He. who feeds and is not fed?'
Say: 'I have been commanded to be the first of them that surrender: "Be not thou of the idolaters."'
Say: 'Indeed I fear, if I should rebel against thy Lord, the chastisement of a dreadful day.'
From whomsoever it is averted on that day, He will have mercy on him; that is the manifest triumph.
And if God visits thee with affliction none can remove it but He; and if He visits thee with good, He is powerful over everything.
He is Omnipotent over His servants, and He is the All-wise, the All-aware. Say: 'What thing is greatest in testimony?'
Say: 'God is witness between me and you, and this Koran has been revealed to me that I may warn you thereby, and whomsoever it may reach.
Do you indeed testify that there are other gods with God?'
Say: 'I do not testify.'
Say: 'He is only One God, and I am quit of that you associate.'
Those to whom We have given the Book recognize it as they recognize their sons.
Those who have lost their own souls, they do not believe.
And who does greater evil than he who forges against God a lie, or cries lies to His signs?
They shall not prosper, the evildoers.
And on the day when We shall muster them all together, then We shall say unto those who associated other gods with God, 'Where are your associates whom you were asserting?
Then they shall have no proving, but to say, 'By God our Lord, we never associated other gods with Thee.'
Behold how they lie against themselves, and how that which they were forging has gone astray from them!
And some of them there are that listen to thee, and We lay veils upon their hearts lest they understand it, and in their ears heaviness; and if they see any sign whatever, they do not believe in it, so that when they come to thee they dispute with thee, the unbelievers saying, 'This is naught but the fairy-tales of the ancient ones.'
And they forbid it, and keep afar from it, and it is only themselves they destroy, but they are not aware.
If thou couldst see when they are stationed before the Fire, and they say, 'Would that we might be returned, and then not cry lies to the signs of our Lord, but that we might be among the believers!'
No; that which they were concealing before has now appeared to them; and even if they were returned, they would again commit the very thing they were prohibited; they are truly liars.
And they say, 'There is only our present life; we shall not be raised.'
If thou couldst see when they are stationed before their Lord!
He will say, 'Is not this the truth?'
They will say, 'Yes indeed, by our Lord!'
He will say, 'Then taste the chastisement for your unbelief.
Lost indeed are they that cried lies to the encounter with God, so that when the Hour comes to them suddenly they shall say, 'Alas for us, that we neglected it!'
On their backs they shall be bearing their loads; O how evil the loads they bear!
The present life is naught but a sport and a diversion; surely the Last Abode is better for those that are godfearing.
What, do you not understand?
We know indeed that it grieves thee the things they say; yet it is not thee they cry lies to, but the evildoers - it is the signs of God that they deny.
Messengers indeed were cried lies to before thee, yet they endured patiently that they were cried lies to, and were hurt, until Our help came unto them.
No man can change the words of God; and there has already come to thee some tiding of the Envoys.
And if their turning away is distressful for thee, why, if thou canst seek out a hole in the earth, or a ladder in heaven, to bring them some sign but had God willed, He would have gathered them to the guidance; so be not thou one of the ignorant.
Answer only will those who hear; as for the dead, God will raise them up, then unto Him they will be returned.
They also say, 'Why has no sign been sent down upon him from his Lord?'
Say: 'Surely God is able to send down a sign, but most of them know not.'
No creature is there crawling on the earth, no bird flying with its wings, but they are nations like unto yourselves.
We have neglected nothing in the Book; then to their Lord they shall be mustered.
And those who cry lies to Our signs are deaf and dumb, dwelling in the shadows.
Whomsoever God will, He leads astray, and whomsoever He will, He sets him on a straight path.
Say: 'What think you?
If God's chastisement comes upon you, or the Hour comes upon you, will you call upon any other than God if you speak truly?'
No; upon Him you will call, and He will remove that for which you call upon Him if He Will, and you will forget that you associate with Him.
Indeed We sent to nations before thee, and We seized them with misery and hardship that haply they might be humble;
if only, when Our might came upon them, they had been humble!
But their hearts were hard, and Satan decked out fair to them what they were doing.
So, when they forgot what they were reminded of; We opened unto them the gates of everything until; when they rejoiced in what they were given, We seized them suddenly, and behold, they were sore confounded.
So the last remnant of the people who did evil was cut off. Praise belongs to God the Lord of all Being.
Say: 'What think you?
If God seizes your hearing and sight, and sets a seal upon your hearts, who is a god other than God to give it back to you?'
Behold how We turn about the signs! Yet thereafter they are turning away.
Say: 'What think you?
If God's chastisement comes upon you, suddenly or openly, shall any be destroyed, except the people of the evildoers?'
We do not send the Envoys, except good tidings to bear, and warning; whoever believes and makes amends -- no fear shall be on them, neither shall they sorrow.
But those who cry lies to Our signs, them the chastisement shall visit, for that they were ungodly.
Say: 'I do not say to you, "I possess the treasuries of God"; I know not the Unseen. And I say not to you, "I am an angel"; I only follow what is revealed to me.
Say: 'Are the blind and the seeing man equal?
Will you not reflect?'
And warn therewith those who fear they shall be mustered to their Lord; they have, apart from God, no protector and no intercessor; haply they will be godfearing.
And do not drive away those who call upon their Lord at morning and evening desiring His countenance; nothing of their account falls upon thee, and nothing of thy account falls upon them, that thou shouldst drive them away, and so become one of the evildoers.
Even so We have tried some of them by others that they may say, Are these the ones God has been gracious to among us?'
Knows not God very well the thankful?
And when those who believe in Our signs come to thee, say, 'Peace be upon you.
Your Lord has prescribed for Himself mercy. Whosoever of you does evil in ignorance, and thereafter repents and makes amends, He is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.'
Thus We distinguish Our signs, that the sinners' way may be manifest.
Say: 'I am forbidden to serve those you call on apart from God.'
Say: 'I do not follow your caprices, or else I had gone astray, and would not be of the right-guided.'
Say: 'I stand upon a clear sign from my Lord, and you have cried lies to it.
Not with me is that you seek to hasten; the judgment is God's alone.
He relates the truth, and He is the Best of deciders.'
Say: 'If what you seek to hasten were with me, the matter between you and me would be decided; and God knows very well the evildoers.'
With Him are the keys of the Unseen; none knows them but He.
He knows what is in land and sea; not a leaf falls, but He knows it.
Not a grain in the earth's shadows, not a thing, fresh or withered, but it is in a Book Manifest.
It is He who recalls you by night, and He knows what you work by day; then He raises you up therein, that a stated term may be determined; then unto Him shall you return, then He will tell you of what you have been doing.
He is the Omnipotent over His servants. He sends recorders over you till, when any one of you is visited by death, Our messengers take him and they neglect not.
Then they are restored to God their Protector, the True.
Surely His is the judgment; He is the swiftest of reckoners.
Say: 'Who delivers you from the shadows of land and sea? You call upon Him humbly and secretly, "Truly, if Thou deliverest from these, we shall be among the thankful."
Say: 'God delivers you from them and from every distress; then you assign Him associates.'
Say: 'He is able to send forth upon you chastisement, from above you or from under your feet, or to confuse you in sects and to make you taste the violence of one another.'
Behold how We turn about the signs; haply they will understand.
Thy people have cried it lies; yet it is the truth.
Say: 'I am not a guardian over you.
Every tiding has its time appointed; you will surely know.'
When thou seest those who plunge into Our signs, turn away from them until they plunge into some other talk; or if Satan should make thee forget, do not sit, after the reminding, with the people of the evildoers.
Nothing of their account falls upon those that are godfearing; but a reminding; haply they will be godfearing.
Leave alone those who take their religion for a sport and a diversion, and whom the present life has deluded.
Remind hereby, lest a soul should be given up to destruction for what it has earned; apart from God, it has no protector and no intercessor; though it offer any equivalent, it shall not be taken from it.
Those are they who are given up to destruction for what they have earned; for them awaits a draught of boiling water and a painful chastisement, for that they were unbelievers.
Say: 'Shall we call, apart from God, on that which neither profits nor hurts us, and shall we be turned back on our heels after that God has guided us? -- Like one lured to bewilderment in the earth by Satans, though he has friends who call him to guidance, "Come to us!"
Say: 'God's guidance is the true guidance, and we are commanded to surrender to the Lord of all Being,
and: "Perform the prayer, and fear Him; it is unto Him you shall be mustered."
It is He who created the heavens and the earth in truth; and the day He says 'Be', and it is; His saying is true, and His is the Kingdom the day the Trumpet is blown; He is Knower of the Unseen and the visible; He is the All-wise, the All-aware.
And when Abraham said to his father Azar, 'Takest thou idols for gods?
I see thee, and thy people, in manifest error.'
So We were showing Abraham the kingdom of the heavens and earth, that he might be of those having sure faith.
When night outspread over him he saw a star and said, 'This is my Lord.'
But when it set he said, 'I love not the setters.'
When he saw the moon rising, he said, 'This is my Lord.'
But when it set he said, 'If my Lord does not guide me I shall surely be of the people gone astray.'
When he saw the sun rising, he said, 'This is my Lord; this is greater!'
But when it set he said, 'O my people, surely I am quit of that you associate.
I have turned my face to Him who originated the heavens and the earth, a man of pure faith; I am not of the idolaters.'
His people disputed with him.
He said, 'Do you dispute with me concerning God, and He has guided me?
I fear not what you associate with Him, except my Lord will aught.
My Lord embraces all things in His knowledge; will you not remember?
How should I fear what you have associated, seeing you fear not that you have associated with God that whereon He has not sent down on you any authority?'
Which of the two parties has better title to security, if you have any knowledge?
Those who believe, and have not confounded their belief with evildoing -- to them belongs the true security; they are rightly guided.
That is Our argument, which We bestowed upon Abraham as against his people.
We raise up in degrees whom We will; surely thy Lord is All-wise, All-knowing.
And We gave to him Isaac and Jacob -- each one We guided, And Noah We guided before; and of his seed David and Solomon, Job and Joseph, Moses and Aaron -- even so We recompense the good-doers --
Zachariah and John, Jesus and Elias; each was of the righteous;
Ishmael and Elisha, Jonah and Lot-each one We preferred above all beings;
and of their fathers, and of their seed, and of their brethren; and We elected them, and We guided them to a straight path.
That is God's guidance; He guides by it whom He will of His servants; had they been idolaters, it would have failed them, the things they did.
Those are they to whom We gave the Book, the Judgment, the Prophethood; so if these disbelieve in it, We have already entrusted it to a people who do not disbelieve in it.
Those are they whom God has guided; so follow their guidance.
Say: 'I ask of you no wage for it; it is but a reminder unto all beings.'
They measured not God with His true measure when they said, 'God has not sent down aught on any mortal.'
Say: 'Who sent down the Book that Moses brought as a light and a guidance to men? You put it into parchments, revealing them, and hiding much; and you were taught that you knew not, you and your fathers.'
Say: 'God.'
Then leave them alone, playing their game of plunging.
This is a Book We have sent down, blessed and confirming that which was before it, and for thee to warn the Mother of Cities and those about her; and those who believe in the world to come believe in it, and watch over their prayers.
And who does greater evil than he who forges against God a lie, or says,, 'To me it has been revealed', when naught has been revealed to him, or he who says, 'I will send down the like of what God has sent down'?
If thou couldst only see when the evildoers are in the agonies of death, and the angels are stretching out their hands: 'Give up your souls!
Today you shall be recompensed with the chastisement of humiliation for what you said untruly about God, waxing proud against His signs.'
'Now you have come to Us one by one, as We created you upon the first time, and you have left what We conferred on you behind your backs. We do not see with you your intercessors, those you asserted to be associates in you; the bond between you is now broken; that which you ever asserted has now gone astray from you.
It is God who splits the grain and the date-stone, brings forth the living from the dead; He brings forth the dead too from the living.
So that then is God; then how are you perverted?
He splits the sky into dawn, and has made the night for a repose, and the sun and moon for a reckoning. That is the ordaining of the All-mighty, the All-knowing.
It is He who has appointed for you the stars, that by them you might be guided in the shadows of land and sea.
We have distinguished the signs for a people who know.
It is He who produced you from one living soul, and then a lodging-place, and then a repository. We have distinguished the signs for a people who understand.
It is He who sent down out of heaven water, and thereby We have brought forth the shoot of every plant, and then We have brought forth the green leaf of it, bringing forth from it close-compounded grain, and out of the palm-tree, from the spathe of it, dates thick-lustered, ready to the hand, and gardens of vines, olives, pomegranates, like each to each, and each unlike to each.
Look upon their fruits when they fructify and ripen!
Surely, in all this are signs for a people who do believe.
Yet they ascribe to God, as associates, the jinn, though He created them; and they impute to Him sons and daughters without any knowledge.
Glory be to Him! High be He exalted above what they describe!
The Creator of the heavens and the earth -- how should He have a son, seeing that He has no consort, and He created all things, and He has knowledge of everything?
That then is God your Lord; there is no god but He, the Creator of everything.
So serve Him, for He is Guardian over everything.
The eyes attain Him not, but He attains the eyes; He is the All-subtle, the All-aware.
Clear proofs have come to you from your Lord. Whoso sees clearly, it is to his own gain, and whoso is blind, it is to his own loss; I am not a watcher over you.
So We turn about the signs, that they may say, 'Thou hast studied'; and that We may make it clear to a people having knowledge.
Follow thou what has been revealed to thee from thy Lord; there is no god but He; and turn thou away from the idolaters.
Had God willed, they were not idolaters; and We have not appointed thee a watcher over them, neither art thou their guardian.
Abuse not those to whom they pray, apart from God, or they will abuse God in revenge without knowledge.
So We have decked out fair to every nation their deeds; then to their Lord they shall return, and He will tell them what they have been doing.
They have sworn by God the most earnest oaths if a sign comes to them they will believe in it.
Say: 'Signs are only with God.'
What will make you realize that, when it comes, they will not believe?
We shall turn about their hearts and their eyes, even as they believed not in it the first time; and We shall leave them in their insolence wandering blindly.
Though We had sent down the angels to them, and the dead had spoken with them, had We mustered against them every thing, face to face, yet they would not have been the ones to believe, unless God willed; but most of them are ignorant.
So We have appointed to every Prophet an enemy -- Satans of men and jinn, revealing tawdry speech to each other, all as a delusion; yet, had thy Lord willed, they would never have done it. So leave them to their forging,
and that the hearts of those who believe not in the world to come may incline to it, and that they may be well-pleased with it, and that they may gain what they are gaining.
What, shall I seek after any judge but God? For it is He who sent down to you the Book well-distinguished; and those whom We have given the Book know it is sent down from thy Lord with the truth; so be not thou of the doubters.
Perfect are the words of thy Lord in truthfulness and justice; no man can change His words; He is the All-hearing, the All-knowing.
If thou obeyest the most part of those on earth they will lead thee astray from the path of God; they follow only surmise, merely conjecturing.
Thy Lord knows very well who goes astray from His path; He knows very well the right-guided.
Eat of that over which God's Name has been mentioned, if you believe in His signs.
How is it with you, that you do not eat of that over which God's Name has been mentioned, seeing that He has distinguished for you that He has forbidden you, unless you are constrained to it?
But surely, many lead astray by their caprices, without any knowledge; thy Lord knows very well the transgressors.
Forsake the outward sin, and the inward surely the earners of sin shall be recompensed for what they have earned.
And eat not of that over which God's Name has not been mentioned; it is ungodliness.
The Satans inspire their friends to dispute with you; if you obey them, you are idolaters.
Why, is he who was dead, and We gave him life, and appointed for him a light to walk by among the people as one whose likeness is in the shadows, and comes not forth from them?
So it is decked out fair to the unbelievers the things they have done.
And even so We appointed in every city great ones among its sinners, to devise there; but they devised only against themselves, and they were not aware.
And when a sign came to them, they said, 'We will not believe until we are given the like of what God's Messengers were given.'
God knows very well where to place His Message; and humiliation in God's sight shall befall the sinners, and a terrible chastisement, for what they devised.
Whomsoever God desires to guide, He expands his breast to Islam; whomsoever He desires to lead astray, He makes his breast narrow, tight, as if he were climbing to heaven.
So God lays abomination upon those who believe not.
This is the path of thy Lord; straight; We have distinguished the signs to a people who remember.
Theirs is the abode of peace with their Lord, and He is their Protector for that they were doing.
On the day when He shall muster them all together: 'Company of jinn, you have made much of mankind.'
Then their friends among mankind will say, 'Our Lord, we have profited each of the other, and we have reached the term determined by Thee for us.
He will say: 'The Fire is your lodging, therein to dwell forever' - except as God will; surely thy Lord is All-wise, All-knowing.
So We make the evildoers friends of each other for what they have earned.
'Company of jinn and mankind, did not Messengers come to you from among you, relating to you My signs and warning you of the encounter of this your day?'
They shall say, 'We bear witness against ourselves.'
They were deluded by the present life, and they bear witness against themselves that they were unbelievers.
That is because thy Lord would never destroy the cities unjustly, while their inhabitants were heedless.
All have degrees according to what they have done; thy Lord is not heedless of the things they do.
Thy Lord is All-sufficient, Merciful.
If He will, He can put you away, and leave after you, to succeed you, what He will, as He produced you from the seed of another people.
The thing you are promised, that will surely come; you cannot frustrate it.
Say: 'O my people, act according to your station; I am acting.
And assuredly you will know who shall possess the Abode Ultimate.
Surely the evildoers will not prosper.'
They appoint to God, of the tillage and cattle that He multiplied, a portion, saying, 'This is for God' -- so they assert -- 'and this is for our associates.'
So what is for their associates reaches not God; and what is for God reaches their associates.
Evil is their judgment!
Thus those associates of theirs have decked out fair to many idolaters to slay their children, to destroy them, and to confuse their religion for them.
Had God willed, they would not have done so; so leave them to their forging.
They say, 'These are cattle and tillage sacrosanct; none shall eat them, but whom we will'-- so they assert -- 'and cattle whose backs have been forbidden, and cattle over which they mention not the Name of God.' All that they say, forging against God; He will assuredly recompense them for what they were forging.
And they say, 'What is within the bellies of these cattle is reserved for our males and forbidden to our spouses; but if it be dead, then they all shall be partners in it.'
He will assuredly recompense them for their describing; surely He is All-wise, All-knowing.
Losers are they who slay their children in folly, without knowledge, and have forbidden what God has provided them, forging against God; they have gone astray, and are not right-guided.
It is He who produces gardens trellised, and untrellised, palm-trees, and crops diverse in produce, olives, pomegranates, like each to each, and each unlike to each.
Eat of their fruits when they fructify, and pay the due thereof on the day of its harvest; and be not prodigal; God loves not the prodigal.
And of the cattle, for burthen and for slaughter, eat of what God has provided you; and follow not the steps of Satan; he is a manifest foe to you.
Eight couples: two of sheep, of goats two.
Say: 'Is it the two males He has forbidden or the two females? Or what the wombs of the two females contain?
Tell me with knowledge, if you speak truly.'
Of camels two, of oxen two. Say: 'Is it the two males He has forbidden or the two females?
Or what the wombs of the two females contain?
Or were you witnesses when God charged you with this? Then who does greater evil than he who forges against God a lie, in order that he may lead mankind astray without any knowledge?
Surely God guides not the people of the evildoers.'
Say: 'I do not find, in what is revealed to me, aught forbidden to him who eats thereof except it be carrion, or blood outpoured, or the flesh of swine -- that is an abomination -- or an ungodly thing that has been hallowed to other than God; yet whoso is constrained, not desiring nor transgressing, surely thy Lord is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.'
And to those of Jewry We have forbidden every beast with claws; and of oxen and sheep We have forbidden them the fat of them, save what their backs carry, or their entrails, or what is mingled with bone; that We recompensed them for their insolence; surely We speak truly.
So, if they cry thee lies, say: 'Your Lord is of mercy all-embracing, and His might will never be turned back from the people of the sinners.'
The idolaters will say, 'Had God willed, we would not have been idolaters, neither our fathers, nor would we have forbidden aught.'
Even so the people before them cried lies until they tasted Our might.
Say: 'Have you any knowledge, for you to bring forth for us?
You follow only surmise, merely conjecturing.'
Say: 'To God belongs the argument conclusive; for had He willed, He would have guided you all.'
Say: 'Produce your witnesses, those who testify God has forbidden this.'
Then if they testify, bear not witness with them; and do not thou follow the caprices of those who cried lies to Our signs, and who believe not in the world to come, and ascribe equals to their Lord.
Say: 'Come, I will recite what your Lord has forbidden you: that you associate not anything with Him, and to be good to your parents, and not to slay your children because of poverty; We will provide you and them and that you approach not any indecency outward or inward, and that you slay not the soul God has forbidden, except by right.
That then He has charged you with; haply you will understand.
And that you approach not the property of the orphan, save in the fairer manner, until he is of age.
And fill up the measure and the balance with justice.
We charge not any soul save to its capacity.
And when you speak, be just, even if it should be to a near kinsman. And fulfil God's covenant.
That then He has charged you with; haply you will remember.
And that this is My path, straight; so do you follow it, and follow not divers paths lest they scatter you from His path.
That then He has charged you with; haply you will be godfearing.'
Then We gave Moses the Book, complete for him who does good, and distinguishing every thing, and as a guidance and a mercy; haply they would believe in the encounter with their Lord.
This is a Book We have sent down, blessed; so follow it, and be godfearing; haply so you will find mercy;
lest you should say, 'The Book was sent down only upon two parties before us, and we have indeed been heedless of their study';
or lest you say, 'If the Book had been sent down upon us, we had surely been more rightly guided than they.'
Yet indeed a clear sign has come to you from your Lord, and a guidance and a mercy; and who does greater evil than he who cries lies to God's signs, and turns away from them?
We shall surely recompense those who turn away from Our signs with an evil chastisement for their turning away.
What, do they look for the angels to come to them, nothing less, or that thy Lord should come, or that one of thy Lord's signs should come?
On the day that one of thy Lord's signs comes it shall not profit a soul to believe that never believed before, or earned some good in his belief.
Say: 'Watch and wait; We too are waiting.'
Those who have made divisions in their religion and become sects, thou art not of them in anything; their affair is unto God, then He will tell them what they have been doing.
Whoso brings a good deed shall have ten the like of it; and whoso brings an evil deed shall only be recompensed the like of it; they shall not be wronged.
Say: 'As for me, my Lord has guided me to a straight path, a right religion, the creed of Abraham, a man of pure faith; he was no idolater.'
Say: 'My prayer, my ritual sacrifice, my living, my dying -- all belongs to God, the Lord of all Being.
No associate has He.
Even so I have been commanded, and I am the first of those that surrender.'
Say: 'Shall I seek after a Lord other than God, who is the Lord of all things?'
Every soul earns only to its own account, no soul laden bears the load of another.
Then to your Lord shall you return, and He will tell you of that whereon you were at variance.
It is He who has appointed you viceroys in the earth, and has raised some of you in rank above others, that He may try you in what He has given you.
Surely thy Lord is swift in retribution; and surely He is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
Alif Lam Mim Sad
A Book sent down to thee -- so let there be no impediment in thy breast because of it -- to warn thereby, and as a reminder to believers:
Follow what has been sent down to you from your Lord, and follow no friends other than He; little do you remember.
How many a city We have destroyed!
Our might came upon it at night, or while they took their ease in the noontide,
and they but cried, when Our might came upon there, 'We were evildoers.';
So We shall question those unto whom a Message was sent, and We shall question the Envoys,
and We shall relate to them with knowledge; assuredly We were not absent.
The weighing that day is true; he whose scales are heavy -- they are the prosperers,
and he whose scales are light -- they have lost their soul for wronging Our signs.
We have established you in the earth and there appointed for you livelihood; little thanks you show.
We created you, then We shaped you, then We said to the angels: 'Bow yourselves to Adam'; so they bowed themselves, save Iblis -- he was not of those that bowed themselves.
Said He, 'What prevented thee to bow thyself, when I commanded thee?'
Said he, 'I am better than he; Thou createdst me of fire, and him Thou createdst of clay.'
Said He, 'Get thee down out of it; it is not for thee to wax proud here, so go thou forth; surely thou art among the humbled.'
Said he, 'Respite me till the day they shall be raised.'
Said He, 'Thou art among the ones that are respited.'
Said he, 'Now, for Thy perverting me, I shall surely sit in ambush for them on Thy straight path;
then I shall come on them from before them and from behind them, from their right hands and their left hands; Thou wilt not find most of them thankful.'
Said He, 'Go thou forth from it, despised and banished.
Those of them that follow thee -- I shall assuredly fill Gehenna with all of you.'
'O Adam, inherit, thou and thy wife, the Garden, and eat of where you will, but come not nigh this tree, lest you be of the evildoers.'
Then Satan whispered to them, to reveal to them that which was hidden from them of their shameful parts.
He said, 'Your Lord has only prohibited you from this tree lest you become angels, or lest you become immortals.'
And he swore to them, 'Truly, I am for you a sincere adviser.'
So he led them on by delusion; and when they tasted the tree, their shameful parts revealed to them, so they took to stitching upon themselves leaves of the Garden. And their Lord called to them, 'Did not I prohibit you from this tree, and say to you, "Verily Satan is for you a manifest foe"?'
They said, 'Lord, we have wronged ourselves, and if Thou dost not forgive us, and have mercy upon us, we shall surely be among the lost.'
Said He, 'Get you down, each of you an enemy to each.
In the earth a sojourn shall be yours, and enjoyment for a time.'
Said He, 'Therein you shall live, and therein you shall die, and from there you shall be brought forth.'
Children of Adam! We have sent down on you a garment to cover your shameful parts, and feathers; and the garment of godfearing -- that is better; that is one of God's signs; haply they will remember.
Children of Adam! Let not Satan tempt you as he brought your parents out of the Garden, stripping them of their garments to show them their shameful parts.
Surely he sees you, he and his tribe, from where you see them not.
We have made the Satans the friends of those who do not believe.
And whenever they commit an indecency they say, 'We found our fathers practising it, and God has commanded us to do it.'
Say: 'God does not command indecency; what, do you say concerning God such things as you know not?'
Say: 'My Lord has commanded justice.
Set your faces in every place of worship and call on Him, making your religion sincerely His.
As He originated you so you will return;
a part He guided, and a part justly disposed to error -- they have taken Satans for friends instead of God, and think them guided.'
Children of Adam! Take your adornment at every place of worship; and eat and drink, but be you not prodigal; He loves not the prodigal.
Say: 'Who has forbidden the ornament of God which He brought forth for His servants, and the good things of His providing?'
Say: 'These, on the Day of Resurrection, shall be exclusively for those who believed in this present life.
So We distinguish the signs for a people who know.'
Say: 'My Lord has only forbidden indecencies, the inward and the outward, and sin, and unjust insolence, and that you associate with God that for which He sent down never authority, and that you say concerning God such as you know not.
To every nation a term; when their term comes they shall not put it back by a single hour nor put it forward.
Children of Adam! If there should come to you Messengers from among you, relating to you My signs, then whosoever is godfearing and makes amends -- no fear shall be on them, neither shall they sorrow.
And those that cry lies to Our signs, and wax proud against them -- those shall be the inhabitants of the Fire, therein dwelling forever.
And who does greater evil than he who forges against God a lie, or cries lies to His signs?
Those - their portion of the Book shall reach them; till, when Our messengers come to them, to take them away, they say, 'Where is that you were calling on, beside God?'
They will say, 'They have gone astray from us, and they will bear witness against themselves that they were unbelievers.
He will say, 'Enter among nations that passed away before you, jinn and mankind, into the Fire.'
Whenever any nation enters, it curses its sister-nation; till, when they have all successively come there, the last of them shall say to the first of them, 'O our Lord, these led us astray; so give them a double chastisement of the Fire.'
He will say, 'Unto each a double, but you know not.
The first of them shall say to the last of them, 'You have no superiority over us, then; so taste the chastisement for what you have been earning.'
Those that cry lies to Our signs and wax proud against them the gates of heaven shall not be opened to them, nor shall they enter Paradise until the camel passes through the eye of the needle.
Even so We recompense the sinners;
Gehenna shall be their cradle, above them coverings.
Even so We recompense the evildoers.
And those who believe, and do deeds of righteousness -- We charge not any soul, save according to its capacity; those are the inhabitants of Paradise, therein dwelling forever;
We shall strip away all rancour that is in their breasts; and underneath them rivers flowing; and they will say, 'Praise belongs to God, who guided us unto this; had God not guided us, we had surely never been guided.
Indeed, our Lord's Messengers came with the truth.'
And it will be proclaimed: 'This is your Paradise; you have been given it as your inheritance for what you did.'
The inhabitants of Paradise will call to the inhabitants of the Fire: 'We have found that. which our Lord promised us true; have you found what your Lord promised you true?'
'Yes,' they will say.
And then a herald shall proclaim between them: 'God's curse is on the evildoers
who bar from God's way, desiring to make it crooked, disbelieving in the world to come.
And between them is a veil, and on the Ramparts are men knowing each by their mark, who shall call to the inhabitants of Paradise: 'Peace be upon you!
They have not entered it, for all their eagerness.'
And when their eyes are turned towards the inhabitants of the Fire they shall say, 'Our Lord, do not Thou assign us with the people of the evildoers.'
And the dwellers on the Battlements shall call to certain men they know by their sign: 'Your amassing has not availed you, neither your waxing proud.
Are these the ones that you swore God would never reach with mercy?'
'Enter Paradise; no fear upon you, nor shall you sorrow.
The inhabitants of the Fire shall call to the inhabitants of Paradise: 'Pour on us water, or of that God has provided you!'
They will say: 'God has forbidden them to the unbelievers
who have taken their religion as a diversion and a sport, and whom the present life has deluded.' -- Therefore today We forget them as they forgot the encounter of this their day, and that they denied Our signs.
And We have brought to them a Book that We have well distinguished, resting on knowledge, a guidance and a mercy unto a people that believe.
Do they look for aught else but its interpretation?
The day its interpretation comes, those who before forgot it shall say, 'Indeed, our Lord's Messengers came with the truth.
Have we then any intercessors to intercede for us, or shall we be returned, to do other than that we have done?'
They have indeed lost their souls, and that which they were forging has gone astray from them.
Surely your Lord is God, who created the heavens and the earth in six days -- then sat Himself upon the Throne, covering the day with the night it pursues urgently -- and the sun, and the moon, and the stars subservient, by His command.
Verily, His are the creation and the command.
Blessed be God, the Lord of all Being.
Call on your Lord, humbly and secretly; He loves not transgressors.
Do not corruption in the land, after it has been set, right; and call on Him fearfully, eagerly -- surely the mercy of God is nigh to the good-doers;
It is He who looses the winds, bearing good tidings before His mercy, till, when they are charged with heavy clouds, We drive it to a dead land and therewith send down water, and bring forth, therewith all the fruits.
Even so We shall bring forth the dead; haply you will remember.
And the good land -- its vegetation comes forth by the leave of its Lord, and the corrupt -- it comes forth but scantily.
Even so We turn about the signs for a people that are thankful.
And We sent Noah to his people; and he said, 'O my people, serve God!
You have no god other' than He; truly, I fear for you the chastisement of a dreadful day.'
Said the Council of his people, 'We see thee in manifest error.'
Said he, 'My people, there is no error in me; but I am a Messenger from the Lord of all Being.'
I deliver to you the Messages of my Lord, and I advise you sincerely; for I know from God that you know not.
What, do you wonder that a reminder from your Lord should come to you by the lips of a man from among you? That he may warn you, and you be godfearing, haply to find mercy.'
But they cried him lies; so We delivered him, and those with him, in the Ark, and We drowned those who cried lies to Our signs; assuredly they were a blind people.
And to Ad their brother Hood; he said, 'O my people, serve God!
You have no god other than He; will you not be godfearing?'
Said the Council of the unbelievers of his people, 'We see thee in folly, and we think that thou art one of the liars.'
Said he, 'My people, there is no folly in me; but I am a Messenger from the Lord of all Being.'
I deliver to you the Messages of my Lord; I am your adviser sincere, faithful.
What, do you wonder that a reminder from your Lord should come to you by the lips of a man from among you?
That he may warn you; and remember when He appointed you as successors after the people of Noah, and increased you in stature broadly; remember God's bounties; haply you will prosper.'
They said, 'Why, hast thou come to us that we may serve God alone, and forsake that our fathers served?
Then bring us that thou promisest us, if thou speakest truly.'
Said he, 'Anger and wrath from your Lord have fallen upon you.
What, do you dispute with me regarding names you have named, you and your fathers, touching which God has sent down never authority?
Then watch and wait; I shall be with you watching and waiting.'
So We delivered him, and those with him, by a mercy from Us; and We cut off the last remnant of those who cried lies to Our signs and were not believers.
And to Thamood their brother Salih; he said, 'O my people, serve God!
You have no god other than He; there has now come to you a clear sign from your Lord -- this is the She-camel of God, to be a sign for you.
Leave her that she may eat in God's earth, and do not touch her with evil, lest you be seized by a painful chastisement.
And remember when He appointed you successors after Ad, and lodged you in the land, taking to yourselves castles of its plains, and hewing its mountains into houses.
Remember God's bounties, and do not mischief in the earth, working corruption.'
Said the Council of those of his people who waxed proud to those that were abased, to those of them who believed, 'Do you know that Salih is an Envoy from his Lord?'
They said, 'In the Message he has been sent with we are believers.'
Said the ones who waxed proud, 'As for us, we are unbelievers in the thing in which you believe.'
So they hamstrung the She-camel and turned in disdain from the commandment of their Lord, saying, 'O Salih, bring us that thou promisest us, if thou art an Envoy.'
So the earthquake seized them, and morning found them in their habitation fallen prostrate.
So he turned his back on them, and said, 'O my people, I have delivered to you the Message of my Lord, and advised you sincerely; but you do not love sincere advisers.'
And Lot, when he said to his people, 'What, do you commit such indecency as never any being in all the world committed before you?
See, you approach men lustfully instead of women; no, you are a people that do exceed.'
And the only answer of his people was that they said, 'Expel them from your city; surely they are folk that keep themselves clean!'
So We delivered him and his family, except his wife; she was one of those that tarried.
And We rained down upon them a rain; so behold thou, how was the end of the sinners!
And to Midian their brother Shuaib; he said, 'O my people, serve God!
You have no god other than He; there has now come to you a clear sign from your Lord.
So fill up the measure and the balance, and diminish not the goods of the people; and do not corruption in the land, after it has been set right; that is better for you, if you are believers.
And do not sit in every path, threatening and barring from God's way those who believe in Him, desiring to make it crooked.
And remember when you were few, and He multiplied you; and behold, how was the end of the workers of corruption.
And if there is a party of you who believe in the Message I have been sent with, and a party who believe not, be patient till God shall judge between us; He is the best of judges.'
Said the Council of those of his people who waxed proud, 'We will surely expel thee, O Shuaib, and those who believe with thee, from our city, unless you return into our creed.'
He said, 'What, even though we detest it?
We should have forged against God a lie if we returned into your creed; after God delivered us from it.
It is not for us to return into it, unless God our Lord so will.
Our Lord embraces all things in His knowledge.
In God we have put our trust.
Our Lord, give true deliverance between us and our people; Thou art the best of deliverers.'
Said the Council of those of his people who disbelieved, 'Now, if you follow Shuaib, assuredly in that case you will be losers.'
So the earthquake seized them, and morning found them in their habitation fallen prostrate,
those who cried lies to Shuaib, as if never they dwelt there; those who cried lies to Shuaib, they were the losers.
So he turned his back on them, and said, 'O my people, I have delivered to you the Messages of my Lord, and advised you sincerely; how should I grieve for a people of unbelievers?'
We have sent no Prophet to any city but that We seized its people with misery and hardship, that haply they might be humble;
then We gave them in the place of evil good, till they multiplied, and said, 'Hardship and happiness visited our fathers.'
So We seized them suddenly, unawares.
Yet had the peoples of the cities believed and been godfearing, We would have opened upon them blessings from heaven and earth; but they cried lies, and so We seized them for what they earned.
Do the people of the cities feel secure Our might shall not come upon them at night while they are sleeping?
Do the people of the cities feel secure Our might shall not come upon them in daylight while they are playing?
Do they feel secure against God's devising?
None feels secure against God's devising but the people of the lost.
Is it not a guidance to those who inherit the earth after those who inhabited it that, did We will, We would smite them because of their sins, sealing their hearts so they do not hear?
Those cities We relate to thee tidings of; their Messengers came to them with the clear signs, but they were not the ones to believe in that they had cried lies before; so God seals the hearts of the unbelievers.
We found no covenant in the most part of them; indeed, We found the most part of them ungodly.
Then We sent, after them, Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his Council, but they did them wrong; so behold thou, how was the end of the workers of corruption!
Moses said, 'Pharaoh, I am a Messenger from the Lord of all Being,
worthy to say nothing regarding God except the truth.
I have brought a clear sign to you from your Lord; so send forth with me the Children of Israel.'
Said he, 'If thou hast brought a sign, produce it, if thou speakest truly.'
So he cast his staff; and behold, it was a serpent manifest.
And he drew forth his hand, and lo, it was white to the beholders.
Said the Council of the people of Pharaoh, 'Surely this man is a cunning sorcerer
who desires to expel you from your land; what do you command?'
They said, 'Put him and his brother off a while, and send among the cities musterers,
to bring thee every cunning sorcerer.'
And the sorcerers came to Pharaoh, saying, 'We shall surely have a wage, if we should be the victors?'
He said, 'Yes, indeed; and you shall be among the near-stationed.'
They said, 'Moses, wilt thou cast, or shall we be the casters?'
He said, 'You cast.'
And when they cast they put a Spell upon the people's eyes, and called forth fear of them, and produced a mighty sorcery.
And We revealed to Moses: 'Cast thy staff!'
And lo, it forthwith swallowed up their lying invention.
So the truth came to pass, and false was proved what they were doing.
So they were vanquished there, and they turned about, humbled.
And the sorcerers were cast down, bowing themselves.
They said, 'We believe in the Lord of all Being,
the Lord of Moses and Aaron.
Said Pharaoh, 'You have believed in Him before I gave you leave.
Surely this is a device you have devised in the city that you may expel its people from it. Now you shall know!
I shall assuredly cut off alternately your hands and feet, then I shall crucify you all together.'
They said, 'Surely unto our Lord we are turning.
Thou takest vengeance upon us only because we have believed in the signs of our Lord when they came to us.
Our Lord, pour out upon us patience, and gather us unto Thee surrendering.'
Then said the Council of the people of Pharaoh, 'Wilt thou leave Moses and his people to work corruption in the land, and leave thee and thy gods?' Said he, 'We shall slaughter their sons and spare their women; surely we are triumphant over them!'
Said Moses to his people, 'Pray for succour to God, and be patient; surely the earth is God's and He bequeaths it to whom He will among His servants. The issue ultimate is to the godfearing.'
They said, 'We have been hurt before thou camest to us, and after thou camest to us.'
He said, 'Perchance your Lord will destroy your enemy, and will make you successors in the land, so that He may behold how you shall do.'
Then seized We Pharaoh's people with years of dearth, and scarcity of fruits, that haply they might remember.
So, when good came to them, they said, 'This belongs to us'; but if any evil smote them, they would augur ill by Moses and those with him.
Why, surely their ill augury was with God; but the most of them knew not.
And they said, 'Whatsoever sign thou bringest to us, to cast a spell upon us, we will not believe thee.'
So We let loose upon them the flood and the locusts, the lice and the frogs, the blood, distinct signs; but they waxed proud and were a sinful people.
And when the wrath fell upon them, they said, 'Moses, pray to thy Lord for us by the covenant He has made with thee.
If thou removest from us the wrath, surely we will believe thee, and send forth with thee the Children of Israel.'
But when We removed from them the wrath unto a term that they should come to, lo, they broke their troth.
So We took vengeance on them, and drowned them in the sea, for that they cried lies to Our signs and heeded them not.
And We bequeathed upon the people that were abased all the east and the west of the land We had blessed; and perfectly was fulfilled the most fair word of thy Lord upon the Children of Israel, for that they endured patiently; and We destroyed utterly the works of Pharaoh and his people, and what they had been building.
And We brought the Children of Israel over the sea, and they came upon a people cleaving to idols they had.
They said, 'Moses, make for us a god, as they have gods.'
Said he, 'You are surely a people who are ignorant.
Surely this they are engaged upon shall be shattered, and void is what they have been doing.'
He said, 'What, shall I seek a god for you other than God, who has preferred you above all beings?'
And when We delivered you from the folk of Pharaoh who were visiting you with evil chastisement, slaying your sons, and sparing your women -- and in that was a grievous trial from your Lord.
And We appointed with Moses thirty nights and We completed them with ten, so the appointed time of his Lord was forty nights; and Moses said to his brother Aaron, 'Be my successor among my people, and put things right, and do not follow the way of the workers of corruption.'
And when Moses came to Our appointed time and his Lord spoke with him, he said, 'Oh my Lord, show me, that I may behold Thee!'
Said He, 'Thou shalt not see Me; but behold the mountain -- if it stays fast in its place, then thou shalt see Me.'
And when his Lord revealed Him to the mountain He made it crumble to dust; and Moses fell down swooning.
So when he awoke, he said, 'Glory be to Thee! I repent to Thee; I am the first of the believers.'
Said He, 'Moses, I have chosen thee above all men for My Messages and My Utterance; take what I have given thee, and be of the thankful.'
And We wrote for him on the Tablets of everything an admonition, and a distinguishing of everything: 'So take it forcefully, and command thy people to take the fairest of it.
I shall show you the habitation of the ungodly.
I shall turn from My signs those who wax proud in the earth unjustly; though they see every sign, they will not believe in it, and though they see the way of rectitude they will not take it for a way, and though they see the way of error, they will take it for a way.
That, because they have cried lies to Our signs and heeded them not.'
Those who cry lies to Our signs, and the encounter in the world to come -- their works have failed; shall they be recompensed, except according to the things they have done?
And the people of Moses took to them, after him, of their ornaments a Calf -- a mere body that lowed.
Did they not see it spoke not to them, neither guided them upon any way?
Yet they took it to them, and were evildoers.
And when they smote their hands, and saw that they had gone astray, they said, 'If our Lord has not mercy on us, and forgives us not, surely we shall be of the lost.'
And when Moses returned to his people, angry and sorrowful, he said, 'Evilly have you done in my place, after me; what, have you outstripped your Lord's commandment?'
And he cast down the Tablets, and laid hold of his brother's head, dragging him to him.
He said, 'Son of my mother, surely the people have abased me, and well nigh slain me.
Make not my enemies to gloat over me, and put me not among the people of the evildoers.
He said, 'O my Lord, forgive me and my brother and enter us into Thy mercy; Thou art the most merciful of the merciful.'
'Surely those who took to themselves the Calf -- anger shall overtake them from their Lord, and abasement in this present life; so We recompense those who are forgers.
And those who do evil deeds, then repent thereafter and believe, surely thereafter thy Lord is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.'
And when Moses' anger abated in him, he took the Tablets and in the inscription of them was guidance, and mercy unto all those who hold their Lord in awe.
And Moses chose of his people seventy men for Our appointed time; and when the earthquake seized them, he said, 'My Lord, hadst Thou willed Thou wouldst have destroyed them before, and me.
Wilt Thou destroy us for what the foolish ones of us have done?
It is only Thy trial, whereby Thou leadest astray whom Thou wilt, and guidest whom Thou wilt.
Thou art our Protector; so forgive us, and have mercy on us, for Thou art the best of forgivers.
And prescribe for us in this world good, and in the world to come; we have repented unto Thee.'
Said He, 'My chastisement -- I smite with it whom I will; and My mercy embraces all things, and I shall prescribe it for those who are godfearing and pay the alms, and those who indeed believe in Our signs,
those who follow the Messenger, 'the Prophet of the common folk, whom they find written down with them in the Torah and the Gospel, bidding them to honour, and forbidding them dishonour, making lawful for them the good things and making unlawful for them the corrupt things, and relieving them of their loads, and the fetters that were upon them. Those who believe in him and succour him and help him, and follow the light that has been sent down with him -- they are the prosperers.'
Say: 'O mankind, I am the Messenger of God to you all, of Him to whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth.
There is no god but He.
He gives life, and makes to die.
Believe then in God, and in His Messenger, the Prophet of the common folk, who believes in God and His words, and follow him; haply so you will be guided.'
Of the people of Moses there is a nation who guide by the truth, and by it act with justice.
And We cut them up into twelve tribes, nations. And We revealed to Moses, when his people asked him for water: 'Strike with thy staff the rock'; and there gushed forth from it twelve fountains all the people knew now their drinking-place.
And We outspread the cloud to overshadow them, and We sent down manna and quails upon them: 'Eat of the good things wherewith We have supplied you.'
And they worked no wrong upon Us, but themselves they wronged.
And when it was said to them, 'Dwell in this township and eat of it wherever you will; and say, Unburdening; and enter in at the gate, prostrating; We will forgive you your transgressions, and increase the good-doers.'
Then the evildoers of them substituted a saying other than that which had been said to them; so We sent down upon them wrath out of heaven for their evildoing.
And question them concerning the township which was bordering the sea, when they transgressed the Sabbath, when their fish came to them on the day of their Sabbath, swimming shorewards, but on the day they kept not Sabbath, they came not unto them.
Even so We were trying them for their ungodliness.
And when a certain nation of them said, 'Why do you admonish a people God is about to destroy or to chastise with a terrible chastisement?' They said, 'As an excuse to your Lord; and haply they will be godfearing.'
So, when they forgot that they were reminded of; We delivered those who were forbidding wickedness, and We seized the evildoers with evil chastisement for their ungodliness.
And when they turned in disdain from that forbidding We said to them, 'Be you apes, miserably slinking!'
And when Thy Lord proclaimed He would send forth against them, unto the Day of Resurrection, those who should visit them with evil chastisement.
Surely thy Lord is swift in retribution; surely He is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
And We cut them up into nations in the earth, some of them righteous, and some of them otherwise; and We tried them with good things and evil, that haply they should return.
And there succeeded after them a succession who inherited the Book, taking the chance goods of this lower world, and saying, 'It will be forgiven us'; and if chance goods the like of them come to them, they will take them.
Has not the compact of the Book been taken touching them, that they should say concerning God nothing but the truth?
And they have studied what is in it; and the Last Abode is better for those who are godfearing.
Do you not understand?
And those who hold fast to the Book, and perform the prayer -- surely We leave not to waste the wage of those who set aright.
And when We shook the mountain above them as if it were a canopy, and they supposed it was about to fall on them: 'Take forcefully what We have given you, and remember what is in it; haply you will be godfearing.'
And when thy Lord took from the Children of Adam, from their loins, their seed, and made them testify touching themselves, 'Am I not your Lord?'
They said, 'Yes, we testify'-- lest you should say on the Day of Resurrection, 'As for us, we were heedless of this,'
or lest you say, 'Our fathers were idolaters aforetime, and we were seed after them.
What, wilt Thou then destroy us for the deeds of the vain-doers?'
So We distinguish the signs; and haply they will return.
And recite to them the tiding of him to whom We gave Our signs, but he cast them off; and Satan followed after him, and he became one of the perverts.
And had We willed, We would have raised him up thereby; but he inclined towards the earth and followed his lust.
So the likeness of him is as the likeness of a dog; if thou attackest it it lolls its tongue out, or if thou leavest it, it lolls its tongue out.
That is that people's likeness who cried lies to Our signs.
So relate the story; haply they will reflect.
An evil likeness is the likeness of the people who cried lies to Our signs, and themselves were wronging.
Whomsoever God guides, he is rightly guided; and whom He leads astray -- they are the losers.
We have created for Gehenna many jinn and men: they have hearts, but understand not with them; they have eyes, but perceive not with them; they have ears, but they hear not with them. They are like cattle; nay, rather they are further astray.
Those -- they are the heedless.
To God belong the Names Most Beautiful; so call Him by them, and leave those who blaspheme His Names -- they shall assuredly be recompensed for the things they did.
Of those We created are a nation who guide by the truth, and by it act with justice.
And those who cry lies to Our signs We will draw them on little by little whence they know not;
and I respite them -- assuredly My guile is sure.
Have they not reflected? No madness is in their comrade; he is naught but a plain warner.
Or have they not considered the dominion of the heaven and of the earth, and what things God has created, and that it may be their term is already nigh?
In what manner of discourse then will they after this believe?
Whomsoever God leads astray, no guide he has; He leaves them in their insolence blindly wandering.
They will question thee concerning the Hour, when it shall berth.
Say: 'The knowledge of it is only with my Lord; none shall reveal it at its proper time, but He.
Heavy is it in the heavens and the earth; it will not come on you but suddenly!'
They will question thee, as though thou art well-informed of it.
Say: 'The knowledge of it is only with God, but most men know not.'
Say: 'I have no power to profit for myself; or hurt, but as God will.
Had I knowledge of the Unseen I would have acquired much good, and evil would not have touched me.
I am only a warner, and a bearer of good tidings, to a people believing.'
It is He who created you out of one living soul, and made of him his spouse that he might rest in her.
Then, when he covered her, she bore a light burden and passed by with it; but when it became heavy they cried to God their Lord, 'If Thou givest us a righteous son, we indeed shall be of the thankful.'
Thereafter, when He gave them a righteous son, they assigned Him associates in that He had given them; but God is high exalted above that they associate.
What, do they associate that which creates nothing and themselves are created,
and that have no power to help them, neither they help themselves?
If you call them to guidance they will not follow you; equal it is to you whether you call them, or whether you are silent.
Those on whom you call apart from God, are servants the likes of you; call them and let them answer you, if you speak truly.
What, have they feet wherewith they walk, or have they hands wherewith they lay hold, or have they eyes wherewith they see, or have they ears wherewith they give ear?
Say: 'Call you then to your associates; then try your guile on me, and give me no respite.
My Protector is God who sent down the Book, and He takes into His protection the righteous.
And those on whom you call, apart from God, have no power to help you, neither they help themselves.'
If you call them to the guidance they do not hear; and thou seest them looking at thee, unperceiving.
Take the abundance, and bid to what is honourable, and turn away from the ignorant.
If a provocation from Satan should provoke thee, seek refuge in God; He is All-hearing, All-seeing.
The godfearing, when a visitation of Satan troubles them, remember, and then see clearly;
and their brothers they lead on into error, then they stop not short.
And when thou bringest them not a sign, they say, 'Why hast thou not chosen one?'
Say: 'I follow only what is revealed to me from my Lord; this is clear testimony from your Lord, guidance, and mercy for a people of believers.'
And when the Koran is recited, give you ear to it and be silent; haply so you will find mercy.
Remember thy Lord in thy soul, humbly and fearfully, not loud of voice, at morn and eventide. Be not thou among the heedless.
Surely those who are with thy Lord wax not too proud to serve Him; they chant His praise, and to Him they bow.
They will question thee concerning the spoils.
Say: 'The spoils belong to God and the Messenger; so fear you God, and set things right between you, and obey you God and His Messenger, if you are believers.'
Those only are believers who, when God is mentioned, their hearts quake, and when His signs are recited to them, it increases them in faith, and in their Lord they put their trust,
those who perform the prayer, and expend of what We have provided them,
those in truth are the believers; they have degrees with their Lord, and forgiveness, and generous provision.
As thy Lord brought thee forth from thy house with the truth, and a part of the believers were averse to it,
disputing with thee concerning the truth after it had become clear, as though they were being driven into death with their eyes wide open.
And when God promised you one of the two parties should be yours, and you were wishing that the one not accoutred should be yours; but God was desiring to verify the truth by His words, and to cut off the unbelievers to the last remnant,
and that He might verify the truth and prove untrue the untrue, though the sinners were averse to it.
When you were calling upon your Lord for succour, and He answered you, 'I shall reinforce you with a thousand angels riding behind you.'
God wrought this not, save as good tidings and that your hearts thereby might be at rest; help comes only from God; surely God is All-mighty, All-wise.
When He was causing slumber to overcome you as a security from Him, and sending down on you water from heaven, to purify you thereby, and to put away from you the defilement of Satan, and to strengthen your hearts, and to confirm your feet.
When thy Lord was revealing to the angels, 'I am with you; so confirm the believers.
I shall cast into the unbelievers' hearts terror; so smite above the necks, and smite every finger of them!'
That, because they had made a breach with God and with His Messenger; and whosoever makes a breach with God and with His Messenger, surely God is terrible in retribution.
That for you; therefore taste it; and that the chastisement of the Fire is for the unbelievers.
O believers, when you encounter the unbelievers marching to battle, turn not your backs to them.
Whoso turns his back that day to them, unless withdrawing to fight again or removing to join another host, he is laden with the burden of God's anger, and his refuge is Gehenna -- an evil homecoming!
You did not slay them, but God slew them; and when thou threwest, it was not thyself that threw, but God threw, and that He might confer on the believers a fair benefit; surely God is All-hearing, All-knowing.
That for you; and that God weakens the unbelievers' guile.
If victory you are seeking, victory has already come upon you; and if you give over, it is better for you. But if you return, We shall return, and your host will avail you nothing though it be numerous; and that God is with the believers.
O believers, obey God and His Messenger, and do not turn away from Him, even as you are listening;
and be not as those who say, 'We hear,' and they hear not.
Surely the worst of beasts in God's sight are those that are deaf and dumb and do not understand.
If God had known of any good in them He would have made them hear; and if He had made them hear, they would have turned away, swerving aside.
O believers, respond to God and the Messenger when He calls you unto that which will give you life; and know that God stands between a man and his heart, and that to Him you shall be mustered.
And fear a trial which shall surely not smite in particular the evildoers among you; and know that God is terrible in retribution.
And remember when you were few and abased in the land, and were fearful that the people would snatch you away; but He gave you refuge, and confirmed you with His help, and provided you with the good things, that haply you might be thankful.
O believers, betray not God and the Messenger, and betray not your trusts and that wittingly;
and know that your wealth and your children are a trial, and that with God is a mighty wage.
O believers, if you fear God, He will assign you a salvation, and acquit you of your evil deeds, and forgive you; and God is of bounty abounding.
And when the unbelievers were devising against thee, to confine thee, or slay thee, or to expel thee, and were devising, and God was devising; and God is the best of devisers.
And When Our signs were being recited to them, they said, 'We have already heard; if we wished, we could say the like of this; this is naught but the fairy-tales of the ancients.'
And when they said, 'O God, if this be indeed the truth from Thee, then rain down upon us stones out of heaven, or bring us a painful chastisement.'
But God would never chastise them, with thee among them; God would never chastise them as they begged forgiveness.
But what have they now, that God should not chastise them, when they are barring from the Holy Mosque, not being its protectors?
Its only protectors are the godfearing; but most of them know not.
And their prayer at the House is nothing but a whistling and a clapping of hands -- therefore taste you now the chastisement for your unbelief!
The unbelievers expend their wealth to bar from God's way, and still they will expend it, till it is an anguish for them, then be overthrown, and the unbelievers will be mustered into Gehenna,
that God may distinguish the corrupt from the good, and place the corrupt one upon another, and so heap them up all together, and put them in Gehenna; those are the losers.
Say to the unbelievers, if they give over He will forgive them what is past; but if they return, the wont of the ancients is already gone!
Fight them, till there is no persecution and the religion is God's entirely; then if they give over, surely God sees the things they do;
but if they turn away, know that God is your Protector -- an excellent Protector, an excellent Helper!
Know that, whatever booty you take, the fifth of it is God's, and the Messenger's, and the near kinsman's, and the orphans', and for the needy, and the traveller, if you believe in God and that We sent down upon Our servant on the day of salvation,. the day the two hosts encountered; and God is powerful over everything;
when you were on the nearer bank, and they were on the farther bank, and the cavalcade was below you; and had you made tryst together, you would have surely failed the tryst; but that God might determine a matter that was done, that whosoever perished might perish by a clear sign, and by a clear sign he might live who lived; and surely God is All-hearing, All-knowing.
When God showed thee them in thy dream as few; and had He shown them as many you would have lost heart, and quarrelled about the matter; but God saved; He knows the thoughts in the breasts.
When God showed you them in your eyes as few, when you encountered, and made you few in their eyes, that God might determine a matter that was done; and unto God all matters are returned.
O believers, whensoever you encounter a host, then stand firm, and remember God frequently; haply so you will prosper.
And obey God, and His Messenger, and do not quarrel together, and so lose heart, and your power depart; and be patient; surely God is with the patient.
Be not as those who went forth from their habitations swaggering boastfully to show off to men, and barring from God's way; and God encompasses the things they do.
And when Satan decked out their deeds fair to them, and said, 'Today no man shall overcome you, for I shall be your neighbour.'
But when the two hosts sighted each other, he withdrew upon his heels, saying, 'I am quit of you; for I see what you do not see.
I fear God; and God is terrible in retribution.'
When the hypocrites, and those in whose hearts was sickness, said, 'Their religion has deluded them'; but whosoever puts his trust in God, surely God is All-mighty, All-wise.
If thou couldst only see when the angels take the unbelievers, beating their faces and their backs: 'Taste the chastisement of the burning --
that, for what your hands have forwarded, and for that God is never unjust unto His servants.'
Like Pharaoh's folk, and the people before him, who disbelieved in God's signs; God seized them because of their sins; God is strong, terrible in retribution.
That is because God would never change His favour that He conferred on a people until they changed what was within themselves; and that God is All-hearing, All-knowing.
Like Pharaoh's folk, and the people before him, who cried lies to the signs of their Lord, so We destroyed them because of their sins, and We drowned the folk of Pharaoh; and all were evildoers.
Surely the worst of beasts in God's sight are the unbelievers, who will not believe,
those of them with whom thou hast made compact then they break their compact every time, not being godfearing.
So, if thou comest upon them anywhere in the war, deal with them in such wise as to scatter the ones behind them; haply they will remember.
And if thou fearest treachery any way at the hands of a people, dissolve it with them equally; surely God loves not the treacherous.
And thou art not to suppose that they who disbelieve have outstripped Me; they cannot frustrate My will.
Make ready for them whatever force and strings of horses you can, to terrify thereby the enemy of God and your enemy, and others besides them that you know not; God knows them. And whatsoever you expend in the way of God shall be repaid you in full; you will not be wronged.
And if they incline to peace, do thou incline to it; and put thy trust in God; He is the All-hearing, the All-knowing.
And if they desire to trick thee, God is sufficient for thee; He has confirmed thee with His help, and with the believers,
and brought their hearts together.
Hadst thou expended all that is in the earth, thou couldst not have brought their hearts together; but God brought their hearts together; surely He is All-mighty, All-wise.
O Prophet, God suffices thee, and the believers who follow thee.
O Prophet, urge on the believers to fight.
If there be twenty of you, patient men, they will overcome two hundred; if there be a hundred of you, they will overcome a thousand unbelievers, for they are a people who understand not.
Now God has lightened it for you, knowing that there is weakness in you.
If there be a hundred of you, patient men, they will overcome two hundred; if there be of you a thousand, they will overcome two thousand by the leave of God; God is with the patient.
It is not for any Prophet to have prisoners until he make wide slaughter in the land.
You desire the chance goods of the present world, and God desires the world to come; and God is All-mighty, All-wise.
Had it not been for a prior prescription from God, there had afflicted you, for what you took, a mighty chastisement.
Eat of what you have taken as booty, such as is lawful and good; and fear you God; surely God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
O Prophet, say to the prisoners in your hands: 'If God knows of any good in your hearts He will give you better than what has been taken from you, and He will forgive you; surely God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.'
And if they desire treachery against thee, they have tricked God before; but He has given thee power over them; and God is All-knowing, All-wise.
Those who believe, and have emigrated and struggled with their possessions and their selves in the way of God, and those who have given refuge and help -- those are friends one of another.
And those who believe, but have not emigrated -- you have no duty of friendship towards them till they emigrate; yet if they ask you for help, for religion's sake, it is your duty to help them, except against a people between whom and you there is a compact; and God sees the things you do.
As for the unbelievers, they are friends one of another.
Unless you do this, there will be persecution in the land and great corruption.
And those who believe, and have emigrated and struggled in the way of God. those who have given refuge and help those in truth are the believers, and theirs shall be forgiveness and generous provision.
And those who have believed afterwards and emigrated, and struggled with you -- they belong to you; but those related by blood are nearer to one another in the Book of God; surely God has knowledge of everything.
An acquittal, from God and His Messenger, unto the idolaters with whom you made covenant:
'Journey freely in the land for four months; and know that you cannot frustrate the will of God, and that God degrades the unbelievers.'
A proclamation, from God and His Messenger, unto mankind on the day of the Greater Pilgrimage: 'God is quit, and His Messenger, of the idolaters.
So if you repent, that will be better for you; but if you turn your backs; know that you cannot frustrate the will of God.
And give thou good tidings to the unbelievers of a painful chastisement;
excepting those of the idolaters with whom you made covenant, then they failed. you naught neither lent support to any man against you.
With them fulfil your covenant till their term; surely God loves the godfearing.
Then, when the sacred months are drawn away, slay the idolaters wherever you find them, and take them, and confine them, and lie in wait for them at every place of ambush.
But if they repent, and perform the prayer, and pay the alms, then let them go their way; God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
And if any of the idolaters seeks of thee protection, grant him protection till he hears the words of God; then do thou convey him to his place of security -- that, because they are a people who do not know.
How should the idolaters have a covenant with God and His Messenger? -- excepting those with whom you made covenant at the Holy Mosque; so long as they go straight with you, do you go straight with them; surely God loves the godfearing.
How?
If they get the better of you, they will not observe towards you any bond or treaty, giving you satisfaction with their mouths but in their hearts refusing; and the most of them are ungodly.
They have sold the signs of God for a small price, and have barred from His way; truly evil is that they have been doing,
observing neither bond nor treaty towards a believer; they are the transgressors.
Yet if they repent, and perform the prayer, and pay the alms, then they are your brothers in religion; and We distinguish the signs for a people who know.
But if they break their oaths after their covenant and thrust at your religion, then fight the leaders of unbelief; they have no sacred oaths; haply they will give over.
Will you not fight a people who broke their oaths and purposed to expel the Messenger, beginning the first time against you?
Are you afraid of them?
You would do better to be afraid of God, if you are believers.
Fight them, and God will chastise them at your hands and degrade them, and He will help you against them, and bring healing to the breasts of a people who believe,
and He will remove the rage within their hearts; and God turns towards whomsoever He will; God is All-knowing, All-wise
Or did you suppose you would be left in peace, and God knows not as yet those of you who have struggled, and taken not -- apart from God and His Messenger and the believers -- any intimate?
God is aware of what you do.
It is not for the idolaters to inhabit God's places of worship, witnessing against themselves unbelief; those -- their works have failed them, and in the Fire they shall dwell forever.
Only he shall inhabit God's places of worship who believes in God and the Last Day, and performs the prayer, and pays the alms, and fears none but God alone; it may be that those will be among the guided.
Do you reckon the giving of water to pilgrims and the inhabiting of the Holy Mosque as the same as one who believes in God and the Last Day and struggles in the way of God?
Not equal are they in God's sight; and God guides not the people of the evildoers.
Those who believe, and have emigrated, and have struggled in the way of God with their possessions and their selves are mightier in rank with God; and those -- they are the triumphant;
their Lord gives them good tidings of mercy from Him and good pleasure; for them await gardens wherein is lasting bliss,
therein to dwell forever and ever; surely with God is a mighty wage.
O believers, take not your fathers and brothers to be your friends, if they prefer unbelief to belief; whosoever of you takes them for friends, those -- they are the evildoers.
Say: 'If your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your wives, your clan, your possessions that you have gained, commerce you fear may slacken, dwellings you love -- if these are dearer to you than God and His Messenger, and to struggle in His way, then wait till God brings His command; God guides not the people of the ungodly.'
God has already helped you on many fields, and on the day of Hunain, when your multitude was pleasing to you, but it availed you naught, and the land for all its breadth was strait for you, and you turned about, retreating.
Then God sent down upon His Messenger His Shechina, and upon the believers, and He sent down legions you did not see, and He chastised the unbelievers; and that is the recompense of the unbelievers;
then God thereafter turns towards whom He will; God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
O believers, the idolaters are indeed unclean; so let them not come near the Holy Mosque after this year of theirs. If you fear poverty, God shall surely enrich you of His bounty, if He will; God is All-knowing; All-wise.
Fight those who believe not in God and the Last Day and do not forbid what God and His Messenger have forbidden -- such men as practise not the religion of truth, being of those who have been given the Book -- until they pay the tribute out of hand and have been humbled.
The Jews say, 'Ezra is the Son of God'; the Christians say, 'The Messiah is the Son of God.'
That is the utterance of their mouths, conforming with the unbelievers before them.
God assail them!
How they are perverted!
They have taken their rabbis and their monks as lords apart from God, and the Messiah, Mary's son -- and they were commanded to serve but One God; there is no god but He; glory be to Him, above that they associate --
desiring to extinguish with their mouths God's light; and God refuses but to perfect His light, though the unbelievers be averse.
It is He who has sent His Messenger with the guidance and the religion of truth, that He may uplift it above every religion, though the unbelievers be averse.
O believers, many of the rabbis and monks indeed consume the goods of the people in vanity and bar from God's way.
Those who treasure up gold and silver, and do not expend them in the way of God -- give them the good tidings of a painful chastisement,
the day they shall be heated in the fire of Gehenna and therewith their foreheads and their sides and their backs shall be branded: 'This is the thing you have treasured up for yourselves; therefore taste you now what you were treasuring!'
The number of the months, with God, is twelve in the Book of God, the day that He created the heavens and the earth; four of them are sacred.
That is the right religion.
So wrong not each other during them.
And fight the unbelievers totally even as they fight you totally and know that God is with the godfearing.
The month postponed is an increase of unbelief whereby the unbelievers go astray; one year they make it profane, and hallow it another, to agree with the number that God has hallowed, and so profane what God has hallowed. Decked out fair to them are their evil deeds; and God guides not the people of the unbelievers.
O believers, what is amiss with you, that when it is said to you, 'Go forth in the way of God,' you sink down heavily to the ground?
Are you so content with this present life, rather than the world to come?
Yet the enjoyment of this present life, compared with the world to come, is a little thing.
If you go not forth, He will chastise you with a painful chastisement, and instead of you He will substitute another people; and you will not hurt Him anything, for God is powerful over everything.
If you do not help him, yet God has helped him already, when the unbelievers drove him forth the second of two, when the two were in the Cave, when he said to his companion, 'Sorrow not; surely God is with us.'
Then God sent down on him His Shechina, and confirmed him with legions you did not see; and He made the word of the unbelievers the lowest; and God's word is the uppermost; God is All-mighty, All-wise.
Go forth, light and heavy! Struggle in God's way with your possessions and your selves; that is better for you, did you know.
Were it a gain near at hand, and an easy journey, they would have followed thee; but the distance was too far for them.
Still they will swear by God, 'Had we been able, we would have gone out with you,' so destroying their souls; and God knows that they are truly liars.
God pardon thee!
Why gavest thou them leave, till it was clear to thee which of them spoke the truth, and thou knewest the liars?
Those who believe in God and the Last Day ask not leave of thee, that they may struggle with their possessions and their selves; and God knows the godfearing.
They only ask leave of thee who believe not in God and the Last Day, those whose hearts are filled with doubt, so that in their doubt they go this way and that.
If they had desired to go forth, they would have made some preparation for it; but God was averse that they should be aroused, so He made them pause, and it was said to them, 'Tarry you with the tarriers.'
Had they gone forth among you, they would only have increased you in trouble, and run to and fro in your midst, seeking to stir up sedition between you; and some of you would listen to them; and God knows the evildoers.
They sought to stir up sedition already before, and turned things upside down for thee, until the truth came, and God's command appeared, though they were averse.
Some of them there are that say, 'Give me leave and do not tempt me.'
Have not such men fallen into temptation?
And surely Gehenna encompasses the unbelievers.
If good fortune befalls thee, it vexes them; but if thou art visited by an affliction, they say, 'We took our dispositions before', and turn away, rejoicing.
Say: 'Naught shall visit us but what God has prescribed for us; He is our Protector; in God let the believers put all their trust.'
Say: 'Are you awaiting for aught to come to us but one of the two rewards most fair? We are awaiting in your case too, for God to visit you with chastisement. from Him, or at our hands; so await; we are awaiting with you.'
Say: 'Expend willingly, or unwillingly, it shall not be accepted from you; you are surely a people ungodly.'
And naught prevents that their expendings should be accepted from them, but that they believe not in God and His Messenger, and perform not the prayer save lazily, and that they expend not without they are averse.
So let not their possessions or their children please thee; God only desires thereby to chastise them in this present life, and that their souls should depart while they are unbelievers.
They swear by God that they belong with you, but they are not of you they are a people that are afraid.
If they could find a shelter, or some caverns, or any place to creep into, they would turn about and bolt away to it.
Some of them find fault with thee touching the freewill offerings; if they are given a share of them they are well-pleased, but if they are given none then they are angry.
O were they well-pleased with what God and His Messenger have brought them, saying, 'Enough for us is God; God will bring us of His bounty, and His Messenger; to God we humbly turn.'
The freewill offerings are for the poor and needy, those who work to collect them, those whose hearts are brought together, the ransoming of slaves, debtors, in God's way, and the traveller; so God ordains; God is All-knowing, All-wise.
And some of them hurt the Prophet, saying, 'He is an ear!' Say: 'An ear of good for you; he believes in God, and believes the believers, and he is a mercy to the believers among you.
Those who hurt God's Messenger -- for them awaits a painful chastisement.'
They swear to you by God, to please you; but God and His Messenger -- more right is it they should please Him, if they are believers.
Do they not know that whosoever opposes God and His Messenger -- for him awaits the fire of Gehenna, therein to dwell forever?
That is the mighty degradation.
The hypocrites are afraid, lest a sura should be sent down against them, telling thee what is in their hearts.
Say: 'Mock on; God will bring forth what you fear.'
And if thou questionest them, then assuredly they will say, 'We were only plunging and playing.'
Say: 'What, then were you mocking God, and His signs, and His Messenger?
Make no excuses.
You have disbelieved after your believing.
If We forgive one party of you, We will chastise another party for that they were sinners.'
The hypocrites, the men and the women, are as one another; they bid to dishonour, and forbid honour; they keep their hands shut; they have forgotten God, and He has forgotten them.
The hypocrites -- they are the ungodly.
God has promised the hypocrites, men and women, and the unbelievers, the fire of Gehenna, therein to dwell foreover.
That is enough for them; God has cursed them; and there awaits them Like a lasting chastisement.
those before you, who were stronger than you in might, and more abundant in wealth and children; they took enjoyment in their share; so do you take enjoyment in your share, as those before you took enjoyment in their share.
You have plunged as they plunged.
Those -- their works have failed in this world and in the world to come; those -- they are the losers.
Has there not come to you the tidings of those who were before you -- the people of Noah, Ad, Thamood, the people of Abraham, the men of Midian and the subverted cities?
Their Messengers came to them with the clear signs God would not wrong them, but themselves they wronged.
And the believers, the men and the women, are friends one of the other; they bid to honour, and forbid dishonour; they perform the prayer, and pay the alms, and they obey God and His Messenger.
Those -- upon them God will have mercy; God is All-mighty, All-wise.
God has promised the believers, men and women, gardens underneath which rivers flow, forever therein to dwell, and goodly dwelling-places in the Gardens of Eden; and greater, God's good pleasure; that is the mighty triumph.
O Prophet, struggle with the unbelievers and hypocrites, and be thou harsh with them; their refuge is Gehenna -- an evil homecoming!
They swear by God that they said nothing, but they indeed said the word of unbelief and disbelieved, after they had surrendered.
They purposed what they never attained to, and they took revenge only that God enriched them, and His Messenger, of His bounty.
So if they repent it will be better for them; if they turn away, God will chastise them with a painful chastisement in this world and the next; on the earth they have no protector or helper.
And some of them have made covenant with God: 'If He gives us of His bounty, we will make offerings and be of the righteous.'
Nevertheless, when He gave them of His bounty they were niggardly of it, and turned away, swerving aside.
So as a consequence He put hypocrisy into their hearts, until the day they meet Him, for that they failed God in that they promised Him and they were liars.
Did they not know that God knows their secret and what they conspire together, and that God knows the things unseen?
Those who find fault with the believers who volunteer their freewill offerings, and those who find nothing but their endeavour they deride -- God derides them; for them awaits a painful chastisement.
Ask pardon for them, or ask not pardon for them; if thou askest pardon for them seventy times, God will not pardon them; that, because they disbelieved in God and His Messenger; God guides not the people of the ungodly.
Those who were left behind rejoiced in tarrying behind the Messenger of God, and were averse to struggle with their possessions and their selves in the way of God.
They said, 'Go not forth in the heat.'
Say: 'Gehenna's fire is hotter, did they but understand.'
Therefore let them laugh little, and weep much, in recompense for what they have been earning.
So, if God returns thee to a party of them and they ask leave of thee to go forth, say: 'You shall not go forth with me ever, and you shall not fight with me any enemy.
You were well-pleased to tarry the first time, so now tarry with those behind.'
And pray thou never over any one of them when he is dead, nor stand over his grave; they disbelieved in God and His Messenger, and died while they were ungodly.
And let not their possessions and their children please thee; God only desires thereby to chastise them in this present world, and that their souls should depart while they are unbelievers.
And when a sura is sent down, saying, 'Believe in God, and struggle with His Messenger,' the affluent among them ask leave of thee, saying, 'Let us be with the tarriers.'
They are well-pleased to be with those behind, and a seal has been set upon their hearts, so the they understand not.
But Messenger, and the believers with him, have struggled with their possessions and their selves, and those -- for them await the good things; those -- they are the prosperers.
God has prepared for them gardens underneath which rivers flow, therein to dwell forever; that is the mighty triumph.
And the Bedouins came with their excuses, asking for leave; those who lied to God and His Messenger tarried; there shall befall the unbelievers of them a painful chastisement.
There is no fault in the weak and the sick and those who find nothing to expend, if they are true to God and to His Messenger.
There is no way against the good-doers -- God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate --
neither against those who, when they came to thee, for thee to mount them, thou saidst to them, 'I find not whereon to mount you'; they turned away, their eyes overflowing with tears of sorrow, because they found nothing to expend.
The way is open only against those who ask leave of thee, being rich; they are well-pleased to be with those behind; God has set a seal on their hearts, so they know not.
They will excuse themselves to you, when you return to them.
Say: 'Do not excuse yourselves; we will not believe you.
God has already told us tidings of you.
God will surely see your work, and His Messenger, then you will be returned to Him who knows the unseen and the visible, and He will tell you what you were doing.'
They will swear to you by God, when you turn back to them, that you may turn aside from them.
So turn aside from them, for they are an abomination, and their refuge is Gehenna -- a recompense for what they have been earning.
They will swear to you, that you may be well-pleased with them; but if you are well-pleased with them, God will surely not be well-pleased with the people of the ungodly.
The Bedouins are more stubborn in unbelief and hypocrisy, and apter not to know the bounds of what God has sent down on His Messenger; and God is All-knowing, All-wise.
Some of the Bedouins take what they expend for a fine, and await the turns of fortune to go against you.
Theirs shall be the evil turn; God is All-hearing, All-knowing.
And some of the Bedouins believe in God and the Last Day, and take what they expend for offerings bringing them near to God, and the prayers of the Messenger.
Surely they are an offering for them, and God will admit them into His mercy; God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
And the Outstrippers, the first of the Emigrants and the Helpers, and those who followed them in good-doing -- God will be well-pleased with them and they are well-pleased with Him; and He has prepared for them gardens underneath which rivers flow, therein to dwell forever and ever; that is the mighty triumph.
And some of the Bedouins who dwell around you are hypocrites; and some of the people of the City are grown bold in hypocrisy. Thou knowest them not; but We know them, and We shall chastise them twice, then they will be returned to a mighty chastisement.
And other have confessed their sins; they have mixed a righteous deed with another evil.
It may be that God will turn towards them; God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
Take of their wealth a freewill offering, to purify them and to cleanse them thereby, and pray for them; thy prayers are a comfort for them; God is All-hearing, All-knowing.
Do they not know that God is He who accepts repentance from His servants, and takes the freewill offerings, and that God -- He turns, and is All-compassionate?
Say: 'Work; and God will surely see your work, and His Messenger, and the believers, and you will be returned to Him who knows the unseen and the visible, and He will tell you what you were doing.'
And others are deferred to God's commandment, whether He chastises them, or turns towards them; God is All-knowing, All-wise.
And those who have taken a mosque in opposition and unbelief, and to divide the believers, and as a place of ambush for those who fought God and His Messenger aforetime -- they will swear 'We desired nothing but good'; and God testifies they are truly liars.
Stand there never. A mosque that was founded upon godfearing from the first day is worthier for thee to stand in; therein are men who love to cleanse themselves; and God loves those who cleanse themselves.
Why, is he better who founded his building upon the fear of God and His good pleasure, or he who founded his building upon the brink of a crumbling bank that has tumbled with him into the fire of Gehenna?
And God guides not the people of the evildoers.
The buildings they have built will not cease to be a point of doubt within their hearts, unless it be that their hearts are cut into pieces; God is All-knowing, All-wise.
God has bought from the believers their selves and their possessions against the gift of Paradise; they fight in the way of God; they kill, and are killed; that is a promise binding upon God in the Torah, and the Gospel, and the Koran; and who fulfils his covenant truer than God?
So rejoice in the bargain you have made with Him; that is the mighty triumph.
Those who repent, those who serve, those who pray, those whojourney, those who bow, those who prostrate themselves, those who bid to honour and forbid dishonour, those who keep God's hounds -- and give thou good tidings to the believers.
It is not for the Prophet and the believers to ask pardon for the idolaters, even though they be near kinsmen, after that it has become clear to them that they will be the inhabitants of Hell.
Abraham asked not pardon for his father except because of a promise he had made to him; and when it became clear to him that he was an enemy of God, he declared himself quit of him; Abraham was compassionate, clement.
God would never lead a people astray after that He has guided them, until He makes clear to them as to what they should be godfearing; surely God knows everything.
Surely to God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth; He gives life, and makes to die; and you have not, apart from God, either protector or helper.
God has turned towards the Prophet and the Emigrants and the Helpers who followed him in the hour of difficulty, after the hearts of a part of them well-nigh swerved aside; then He turned towards them; surely He is Gentle to them, and All-compassionate.
And to the three who were left behind, until, when the earth became strait for them, for all its breadth, and their souls became strait for them, and they thought that there was no shelter from God except in Him, then He turned towards them, that they might also turn; surely God turns, and is All-compassionate.
O believers, fear God, and be with the truthful ones.
It is not for the people of the City and for the Bedouins who dwell around them to stay behind God's Messenger, and to prefer their lives to his; that is because they are smitten neither by thirst, nor fatigue, nor emptiness in the way of God, neither tread they any tread enraging the unbelievers, nor gain any gain from any enemy, but a righteous deed is thereby written to their account; God leaves not to waste the wage of the good-doers.
Nor do they expend any sum, small or great, nor do they traverse any valley, but it is written to their account, that God may recompense them the best of what they were doing.
It is not for the believers to go forth totally; but why should not a party of every section of them go forth, to become learned in religion, and to warn their people when they return to them, that haply they may beware?
O believers, fight the unbelievers who are near to you; and let them find in you a harshness; and know that God is with the godfearing.
Whenever a sura is sent down to thee, some of them say, 'Which of you has this increased in belief?'
As for the believers, them it has increased in belief, and they are joyful.
But as for those in whose heart is sickness, them it has increased in abomination added to their abomination, and they have died while they were unbelievers.
Do they not see that they are tried every year once or twice?
Yet still they do not repent, nor do they remember.
And whenever a sura is sent down, they look one at another: 'Does anyone see you?'
Then they turn away.
God has turned away their hearts, for that they are a people who do not understand.
Now there has come to you a Messenger from among yourselves; grievous to him is your suffering; anxious is he over you, gentle to the believers, compassionate.
So if they turn their backs, say: 'God is enough for me.
There is no god but He.
In Him I have put my trust. He is the Lord of the Mighty Throne.'
Alif Lam Ra. Those are the signs of the Wise Book.
Was it a wonder to the people that We revealed to a man from among them: 'Warn the people, and give thou good tidings to the believers that they have a sure footing with their Lord'?
The unbelievers say, 'This is a manifest sorcerer.'
Surely your Lord is God, who created the heavens and the earth in six days, then sat Himself upon the Throne, directing the affair.
Intercessor there is none, save after His leave that then is God, your Lord; so serve Him.
Will you not remember?
To Him shall you return, all together -- God's promise, in truth.
He originates creation, then He brings it back again that He may recompense those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, justly. And those who disbelieve -- for them awaits a draught of boiling water, and a painful chastisement, for their disbelieving.
It is He who made the sun a radiance, and the moon a light, and determined it by stations, that you might know the number of the years and the reckoning.
God created that not save with the truth, distinguishing the signs to a people who know.
In the alternation of night and day, and what God has created in the heavens and the earth -- surely there are signs for a godfearing people.
Surely those who look not to encounter Us and are well-pleased with the present life and are at rest in it, and those who are heedless of Our signs,
those -- their refuge is the Fire, for that they have been earning.
Surely those who believe, and do deeds of righteousness, their Lord will guide them for their belief; beneath them rivers flowing in gardens of bliss;
their cry therein, 'Glory to Thee, O God,' their greeting, 'Peace,' and their cry ends, 'Praise belongs to God, the Lord of all Being.'
If God should hasten unto men evil as they would hasten good, their term would be already decided for them.
But We leave those, who look not to encounter Us, in their insolence wandering blindly.
When affliction visits a man, he calls Us on his side, or sitting, or standing; but when We have removed his affliction from him, he passes on, as if he never called Us to an affliction that visited him.
So decked out fair to the prodigal is that they have been doing.
We destroyed the generations before you when they did evil, and their Messengers came to them with the clear signs, but they would not believe; so We recompense the people of the sinners.
Then We appointed you viceroys in the earth after them, that We might behold how you would do.
And when Our signs are recited to them, clear signs, those who look not to encounter Us say, 'Bring a Koran other than this, or alter it.'
Say: 'It is not for me to alter it of my own accord.
I follow nothing, except what is revealed to me.
Truly I fear, if I should rebel against my Lord, the chastisement of a dreadful day.'
Say: 'Had God willed I would not have recited it to you, neither would He have taught you it; I abode among you a lifetime before it -- will you not understand?'
And who does greater evil than he who forges against God a lie, or cries lies to His signs?
Surely the sinners do not prosper.
They serve, apart from God, what hurts them not neither profits them, and they say, 'These are our intercessors with God.'
Say: 'Will you tell God what He knows not either in the heavens or in the earth?'
Glory be to Him! High be He exalted above that they associate!
Mankind were only one nation, then they fell into variance. But for a word that preceded from thy Lord, it had been decided between them already touching their differences.
They say, 'Why has a sign not been sent down upon him from his Lord?'
Say: 'The Unseen belongs only to God.
Then watch and wait; I shall be with you watching and waiting.'
When We let the people taste mercy after hardship has visited them, lo, they have a device concerning Our signs.
Say: 'God is swifter at devising; surely Our messengers are writing down what you are devising.'
It is He who conveys you on the land and the sea; and when you are in the ship -- and the ships run with them with a fair breeze, and they rejoice in it, there comes upon them a strong wind, and waves come on them from every side, and they think they are encompassed; they call upon God, making their religion His sincerely: 'If Thou deliverest us from these, surely we shall be among the thankful.'
Nevertheless when He has delivered them behold, they are insolent in the earth, wrongfully.
O men, your insolence is only against yourselves; the enjoyment of this present life, then unto Us you shall return, then We shall tell you what you were doing.
The likeness of this present life is as water that We send down out of heaven, and the plants of the earth mingle with it whereof men and cattle eat, till, when the earth has taken on its glitter and has decked itself fair, and its inhabitants think they have power over it, Our command comes upon it by night or day, and We make it stubble, as though yesterday it flourished not.
Even so We distinguish the signs for a people who reflect.
And God summons to the Abode of Peace, and He guides whomsoever He will to to a straight path;
the good-doers the reward most fair and a surplus; neither dust nor abasement shall overspread their faces.
Those are the inhabitants of Paradise, therein dwelling forever.
And for those who have earned evil deeds the recompense of an evil deed shall be the like of it; abasement shall overspread them, neither have they any defender from God, as if their faces were covered with strips of night shadowy.
Those are the inhabitants of the Fire, therein dwelling forever.
And the day We shall muster them all, then We shall say to those who associate other gods with God: 'Get you to your place, you and your associates!'
Then We shall set a space between them, and their associates will say, 'Not us you were serving.
God is a sufficient witness between us and you; assuredly we were heedless of your service.'
There every soul shall prove its past deeds; and they shall be restored to God, their Protector, the True, and there shall go astray from them that they were forging.
Say: 'Who provides you out of heaven and earth, or who possesses hearing and sight, and who brings forth the living from the dead and brings forth the dead from the living, and who directs the affair?'
They will surely say, 'God.'
Then say: 'Will you not be godfearing?'
That then is God, your Lord, the True; what is there, after truth, but error?
Then how are you turned about?
Thus the word of thy Lord is realized against the ungodly that they believe not.
Say: 'Is there any of your associates who originates creation, then brings it back again?'
Say: 'God -- He originates creation, then brings it back again; so how are you perverted?'
Say: 'Is there any of your associates who guides to the truth?'
Say: 'God -- He guides to the truth; and which is worthier to be followed -- He who guides to the truth, or he who guides not unless he is guided?
What then ails you, how you judge?'
And the most of them follow only surmise, and surmise avails naught against truth.
Surely God knows the things they do.
This Koran could not have been forged apart from God; but it is a confirmation of what is before it, and a distinguishing of the Book, wherein is no doubt, from the Lord of all Being.
Or do they say, 'Why, he has forged it'?
Say: 'Then produce a sura like it, and call on whom you can, apart from God, if you speak truly.'
No; but they have cried lies to that whereof they comprehended not the knowledge, and whose interpretation has not yet come to them.
Even so those that were before them cried lies; then behold how was the end of the evildoers!
And some of them believe in it, and some believe not in it. Thy Lord knows very well those who do corruption.
If they cry lies to thee, then do thou say: 'I have my work, and you have your work; you are quit of What I do, and I am quit of what you do.'
And some of them give ear to thee; what, wilt thou make the deaf to hear, though they understand not?
And some of them look unto thee; what, wilt thou then guide the blind, though they do not see?
Surely God wrongs not men anything, but themselves men wrong.
And the day He shall muster them, as if they had not tarried but an hour of the day, mutually recognizing one another; lost will be those who cried lies to the encounter with God, and were not guided.
Whether We show thee a part of that We promise them, or We call thee unto Us, to Us they shall return; then God is witness of the things they do
Every nation has its Messenger; then, when their Messenger comes, justly the issue is decided between them, and they are not wronged.
They say, 'When will this promise be, if you speak truly?'
Say: 'I have no power to profit for myself, or hurt, but as God will.
To every nation a term; when their term comes they shall not put it back by a single hour nor put it forward.'
Say: 'Have you considered?
If His chastisement comes upon you by night or day, what part of it will the sinners seek to hasten?
What, when it has come to pass, will you then believe in it?
Now, when already you seek to hasten it!'
Then it will be said to the evildoers: 'Taste the chastisement of eternity!
Are you recompensed for aught but that you have been earning?'
They ask thee to tell them, 'Is it true?'
Say: 'Yes, by my Lord!
It is true; you cannot frustrate Him.'
If every soul that has done evil possessed all that is in the earth, he would offer it for his ransom; and they will be secretly remorseful when they see the chastisement, and justly the issue is decided between them, and they are not wronged.
Why, surely to God belongs everything that is in the heavens and earth.
Why, surely God's promise is true; but the most of them have no knowledge
He gives life, and makes to die, and to Him you shall be returned.
O men, now there has come to you an admonition from your Lord, and a healing for what is in the breasts, and a guidance, and a mercy to the believers.
Say: 'In the bounty of God, and His mercy -- in that let them rejoice; it is better than that they amass.
Say: 'Have you considered the provision God has sent down for you, and you have made some of it unlawful, and some lawful?'
Say: 'Has God given you leave, or do you forge against God?'
What will they think, who forge falsehood against God; on the Day of Resurrection?
God is bountiful to men; but most of them are not thankful.
Thou art not upon any occupation, neither recitest thou any Koran of it, nor do you any work, without that We are witnesses over you when you press on it; and not so much as the weight of an ant in earth or heaven escapes from thy Lord, neither is aught smaller than that, or greater, but in a Manifest Book.
Surely God's friends -- no fear shall be on them, neither shall they sorrow.
Those who believe, and are godfearing --
for them is good tidings in the present life and in the world to come. There is no changing the words of God; that is the mighty triumph.
And do not let their saying grieve thee; the glory belongs altogether to God; He is the All-hearing, the All-knowing.
Why, surely to God belongs everyone that is in the heavens and in the earth; they follow, who call upon associates, apart from God -- they follow nothing but surmise, merely conjecturing.
It is He who made for you the night to repose in it, and the day, to see; surely in that are signs for a people who have ears.
They say, 'God has taken to Him a son.
Glory be to Him!
He is All-sufficient; to Him belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth; you have no authority for this.
What, do you say concerning God that you know not?
Say: 'Those who forge against God falsehood shall not prosper.
Some enjoyment in this world; then unto Us they shall return; then We shall let them taste the terrible chastisement, for that they were unbelievers.
And recite to them the story of Noah when he said to his people, 'My people, if my standing here is grievous to you and my reminding you of the signs of God, in God have I put my trust; so resolve on your affair, with your associates, then let not your affair be a worry to you, but make decision unto me, and respite me not.
Then if you turn your backs, I have not asked you for any wage; my wage falls only on God, and I have been commanded to be of those that surrender.'
But they cried him lies; so We delivered him, and those with him, in the Ark, and We appointed them as viceroys, and We drowned those who cried lies to Our signs; then behold how was the end of them that were warned!
Then We sent forth, after him, Messengers to their people, and they brought them the clear signs; but they were not men to believe in that they had cried lies to before.
So We seal the hearts of the transgressors.
Then We sent forth, after them, Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh and his Council with Our signs, but they waxed proud, and were a sinful people.
So, when the truth came to them from Us, they said, 'Surely this is a manifest sorcery.'
Moses said, 'What, do you say this to the truth, when it has come to you?
Is this a sorcery?
But sorcerers do not prosper.'
They said, 'Art thou come to us to turn us from that we found our fathers practising, and that the domination in the land might belong to you two?
We do not believe you.
Pharaoh said, 'Bring me every cunning sorcerer.'
Then, when the sorcerers came, Moses said to them, 'Cast you down what you will cast.'
Then, when they had cast, Moses said, 'What you have brought is sorcery; God will assuredly bring it to naught.
God sets not right the work of those who do corruption.
God verifies the truth by His words, though sinners be averse.'
So none believed in Moses, save a seed of his people, for fear of Pharaoh and their Council, that they would persecute them; and Pharaoh was high in the land, and he was one of the prodigals.
Moses said, 'O my people, if you believe in God, in Him put your trust, if you have surrendered.'
They said, 'In God we have put our trust.
Our Lord, make us not a temptation to the people of the evildoers,
and deliver us by Thy mercy from the people of the unbelievers.'
And We revealed to Moses and his brother, 'Take you, for your people, in Egypt certain houses; and make your houses a direction for men to pray to; and perform the prayer; and do thou give good tidings to the believers.'
Moses said, 'Our Lord, Thou hast given to Pharaoh and his Council adornment and possessions in this present life. Our Lord, let them go astray from Thy way; Our Lord, obliterate their possessions, and harden their hearts so that they do not believe, till they see the painful chastisement.'
He said, 'Your prayer is answered; so go you straight, and follow not the way of those that know not.'
And We brought the Children of Israel over the sea; and Pharaoh and his hosts followed them insolently and impetuously till, when the drowning overtook him, he said, 'I believe that there is no god but He in whom the Children of Israel believe; I am of those that surrender.'
'Now?
And before thou didst rebel, being of those that did corruption.
So today We shall deliver thee with thy body, that thou mayest be a sign to those after thee.
Surely many men are heedless of Our signs.'
And We settled the Children of Israel in a sure settlement, and We provided them with good things; so they differed not until the knowledge came to them.
Surely thy Lord will decide between them on the Day of Resurrection touching their differences.
So, if thou art in doubt regarding what We have sent down to thee, ask those who recite the Book before thee.
The truth has come to thee from thy Lord; so be not of the doubters,
nor be of those who cry lies to God's signs so as to be of the losers.
Those against whom thy Lord's word is realized will not believe,
though every sign come to them, till they see the painful chastisement.
Why was there never a city that believed, and its belief profited it? -- Except the people of Jonah; when they believed, We removed from them the chastisement of degradation in this present life, and We gave unto them enjoyment for a time.
And if thy Lord had willed, whoever is in the earth would have believed, all of them, all together.
Wouldst thou then constrain the people, until they are believers?
It is not for any soul to believe save by the leave of God; and He lays abomination upon those who have no understanding.
Say: 'Behold what is in the heavens and in the earth!'
But neither signs nor warnings avail a people who do not believe.
So do they watch and wait for aught but the like of the days of those who passed away before them?
Say: 'Then watch and wait; I shall be with you watching and waiting.'
Then We shall deliver Our Messengers and the believers.
Even so, as is Our bounden duty, We shall deliver the believers.
Say: 'O men, if you are in doubt regarding my religion, I serve not those you serve apart from God, but I serve God, who will gather you to Him, and I am commanded to be of the believers, and:
"Set thy face to the religion, a man of pure faith, and be thou not of the idolaters;
and do not call, apart from God, on that which neither profits nor hurts thee, for if thou dost, then thou wilt surely be of the evildoers.
And if God visits thee with affliction, none can remove it but He; and if He desires any good for thee, none can repel His bounty; He causes it to fall upon whomsoever He will of His servants."
He is the All-forgiving, the All-compassionate.'
Say: 'O men, the truth has come to you from your Lord.
Whosoever is guided is guided only to his own gain, and whosoever goes astray, it is only to his own loss.
I am not a guardian over you.
And follow thou what is revealed to thee; and be thou patient until God shall judge; and He is the best of judges.
Alif Lam Ra. A Book whose verses are set clear, and then distinguished, from One All-wise, All-aware:
'Serve you none but God' (I am to you a warner from Him and a bearer of good tidings)
and: 'Ask forgiveness of your Lord, then repent to Him, and He will give you fair enjoyment unto a term stated, and He will give of His bounty to every man of grace.
But if you should turn your backs I fear for you the chastisement of a mighty day;
to God shall you return; He is powerful over everything.'
Behold, they fold their breasts, to hide them from Him; behold, when they wrap themselves in their garments He knows what they secrete and what they publish; surely He knows all the thoughts within the breasts.
No creature is there crawling on the earth, but its provision rests on God; He knows its lodging-place and its repository.
All is in a Manifest Book.
And it is He who created the heavens and the earth in six days, and His Throne was upon the waters -- that He might try you, which one of you is fairer in works.
And if thou sayest, 'you shall surely be raised up after death,' the unbelievers will say, 'This is naught but a manifest sorcery.'
And if We postpone the chastisement from them till a reckoned moment they will say 'What is detaining it?'
Surely, the day it shall come to them, it shall not be turned aside from them, and they shall be encompassed by that they mocked at.
And if We let a man taste mercy from Us, and then We wrest it from him, he is desperate, ungrateful.
But if We let him taste prosperity after hardship that has visited him, he will say, 'The evils have gone from me'; behold, he is joyous, boastful --
save such as are patient, and do deeds of righteousness; for them awaits forgiveness and a mighty wage.
Perchance thou art leaving part of what is revealed to thee, and thy breast is straitened by it, because they say, 'Why has a treasure not been sent down upon him, or an angel not come with him?'
Thou art only a warner; and God is a Guardian over everything.
Or do they say, 'He has forged it'?
Say: 'Then bring you ten suras the like of it, forged; and call upon whom you are able, apart from God, if you speak truly.'
Then, if they do not answer you, know that it has been sent down with God's knowledge, and that there is no god but He.
So have you surrendered?
Whoso desires the present life and its adornment, We will pay them in full for their works therein, and they shall not be defrauded there;
those are they for whom in the world to come there is only the Fire; their deeds there will have failed, and void will be their works.
And what of him who stands upon a clear sign from his Lord, and a witness from Him recites it, and before him is the Book of Moses for an ensample and a mercy?
Those believe in it; but whosoever disbelieves in it, being one of the partisans, his promised land is the Fire.
So be thou not in doubt of it; it is the truth from thy Lord, but most men do not believe.
And who does greater evil than he who forges against God a lie?
Those shall be presented before their Lord, and the witnesses will say, 'Those are they who lied against their Lord.'
Surely the curse of God shall rest upon the evildoers
who bar from God's way, desiring to make it crooked; they disbelieve in the world to come;
they are unable to frustrate Him on earth and they have no protectors, apart from God.
For them the chastisement shall be doubled; they could not hear, neither did they see.
Those are they that have lost their souls, and that they forged has gone astray from them;
they without doubt will be the greatest losers in the world to come.
But those who believe, and do righteous deeds, and have humbled themselves unto their Lord -- they shall be the inhabitants of Paradise, therein dwelling forever.
The likeness of the two parties is as the man blind and deaf, and the man who sees and hears; are they equal in likeness?
Will you not remember?
And We sent Noah to his people: 'I am for you a warner, and a bearer of good tidings:
Serve you none but God.
I fear for you the chastisement of a painful day.'
Said the Council of the unbelievers of his people, 'We see thee not other than a mortal like ourselves, and we see no? any following thee but the vilest of us, inconsiderately. We do not see you have over us any superiority; no, rather we think you are liars.'
He said, 'O my people, what think you? If I stand upon a clear sign from my Lord, and He has given me mercy from Him, and it has been obscured for you, shall we compel you to it while you are averse to it?
O my people, I do not ask of you wealth for this; my wage falls only upon God.
I will not drive away those who believe; they shall surely meet their Lord.
But I see you are an ignorant people.
O my people, who would help me against God, if I drive you away?
Will you not remember? I do not say to you, "I possess the treasuries of God"; I know not the Unseen; and I do not say, "I am an angel."
Nor do I say to those your eyes despise, "God will not give them any good"; God knows best what is in their hearts.
'Surely in that case I should be among the evildoers.'
They said, 'Noah, thou hast disputed with us and make much disputation with us. Then bring us that thou promisest us, if thou speakest truly.'
He said, 'God will bring you it if He will; you cannot frustrate Him.
And my sincere counsel will not profit you, if I desire to counsel you sincerely, if God desires to pervert you; He is your Lord, and unto Him you shall be returned.'
(Or do they say, 'He has forged it'?
Say: 'If I have forged it, upon me falls my sin; and I am quit of the sins you do.')
And it was revealed to Noah, saying, 'None of thy people shall believe but he who has already believed; so be thou not distressed by that they may be doing.
Make thou the Ark under Our eyes, and as We reveal; and address Me not concerning those who have done evil; they shall be drowned.'
So he was making the Ark; and whenever a council of his people passed by him they scoffed at him, He said, 'If you scoff at us, we shall surely scoff at you, as you scoff
and you shall know to whom will come a chastisement degrading him, and upon whom there shall alight a lasting chastisement.'
Until, when Our command came, and the Oven boiled, We said, 'Embark in it two of every kind, and thy family -- except for him against whom the word has already been spoken and whosoever believes.'
And there believed not with him except a few.
He said, 'Embark in it!
In God's Name shall be its course and its berthing.
Surely my Lord is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.'
So it ran with them amid waves like mountains; and Noah called to his son, who was standing apart, 'Embark with us, my son, and be thou not with the unbelievers!'
He said, 'I will take refuge in a mountain, that shall defend me from the water.'
Said he, 'Today there is no defender from God's command but for him on whom He has mercy.'
And the waves came between them, and he was among the drowned.
And it was said, 'Earth, swallow thy waters; and, heaven, abate!'
And the waters subsided, the affair was accomplished, and the Ark settled on El-Judi, and it was said: 'Away with the people of the evildoers!'
And Noah called unto his Lord, and said, 'O my Lord, my son is of my family, and Thy promise is surely the truth. Thou art the justest of those that judge.'
Said He, 'Noah, he is not of thy family; it is a deed not righteous.
Do not ask of Me that whereof thou hast no knowledge.
I admonish thee, lest thou shouldst be among the ignorant.'
He said, 'My Lord, I take refuge with Thee, lest I should ask of Thee that whereof I have no knowledge; for if Thou forgivest me not, and hast not mercy on me, I shall be among the losers.'
It was said, 'Noah, get thee down in peace from Us, and blessings upon thee and on the nations of those with thee; and nations -- We shall give them enjoyment, then there shall visit them from Us a painful chastisement.'
(That is of the tiding's of the Unseen, that We reveal to thee; thou didst not know it, neither thy people, before this.
So be patient; the issue ultimate is to the godfearing.)
And to Ad their brother Hood; he said, 'O my people, serve God!
You have no god other than He; you are but forgers.
O my people, I do not ask of you a wage for this; my wage falls only upon Him who did originate me; will you not understand?
And, O my people, ask forgiveness of your Lord, then repent to Him, and He will loose heaven in torrents upon you, and He will increase you in strength unto your strength; and turn not your backs as sinners.'
They said, 'Hood, thou hast not brought us a clear sign, and we will not leave our gods for what thou sayest; we do not believe thee.
We say nothing, but that one of our gods has smitten thee with some evil.'
He said, 'I call God to witness; and witness you, that I am quit of that you associate
apart from Him; so try your guile on me, all together, then you shall give me no respite.
Truly, I have put my trust in God, my Lord and your Lord; there is no creature that crawls, but He takes it by the forelock.
Surely my Lord is on a straight path.
But if you turn your backs, I have delivered to you that I was sent with unto you, and my Lord will make a people other than you successors; you will not hurt Him anything.
My Lord is Guardian over everything.'
And when Our command came, We delivered Hood and those who believed with him by a mercy from Us, and delivered them from a harsh chastisement.
That was Ad; they denied the signs of their Lord, and rebelled against His Messengers, and followed the command of every froward tyrant.
And there was sent following after them in this world a curse, and upon the Day of Resurrection: 'Surely Ad disbelieved in their Lord: so away with Ad, the people of Hood!'
And to Thamood their brother Salih; he said, 'O my people, serve God!
You have no god other than He.
It is He who produced you from the earth and has given you to live therein; so ask forgiveness of Him, then repent to Him; surely my Lord is nigh, and answers prayer.
They said, 'Salih, thou hast hitherto been a source of hope among us.
What, dost thou forbid us to serve that our fathers served?
Truly we are in doubt, concerning what thou callest us to, disquieting.'
He said, 'O my people, what think you? If I stand upon a clear sign from my Lord, and He has given me mercy from Him, who shall help me against God if I rebel against Him?
You would do nothing for me, except increase my loss.
O my people, this is the She-camel of God, to be a sign for you. Leave her that she may eat in God's earth, and touch her not with evil, lest you' be seized by a nigh chastisement.'
But they hamstrung her; and he said, 'Take your joy in your habitation three days -- that is a promise not to be belied.'
And when Our command came, We delivered Salih and those who believed with him by a mercy from Us, and from the degradation of that day; thy Lord is the All-strong, the All-mighty.
And the evildoers were seized by the Cry, and morning found them in their habitations fallen prostrate
as if they never dwelt there: 'Surely Thamood disbelieved in their Lord, so away with Thamood!'
Our messengers came to Abraham with the good tidings; they said, 'Peace!'
'Peace,' he said; and presently he brought a roasted calf.
And when he saw their hands not reaching towards it, he was suspicious of them and conceived a fear of them.
They said, 'Fear not; we have been sent to the people of Lot.'
And his wife was standing by; she laughed, therefore We gave her the glad tidings of Isaac, and, after Isaac, of Jacob.
She said, 'Woe is me!
Shall I bear, being an old woman, and this my husband is an old man?
This assuredly is a strange thing.'
They said, 'What, dost thou marvel at God's command?
The mercy of God and His blessings be upon you, O people of the House!
Surely He is All-laudable, All-glorious.'
So, when the awe departed from Abraham and the good tidings came to him, he was disputing with Us concerning the people of Lot;
Abraham was clement, compassionate, penitent.
'O Abraham, turn away from this; thy Lord's command has surely come, and there is coming upon them a chastisement not to be turned back.'
And when Our messengers came to Lot, he was troubled on their account and distressed for them, and he said, 'This is a fierce day.'
And his people came to him, running towards him; and erstwhile they had been doing evil deeds.
He said, 'O my people, these are my daughters; they are cleaner for you. So fear God, and do not degrade me in my guests.
What, is there not one man among you of a right mind?'
They said, 'Thou knowest we have no right to thy daughters, and thou well knowest what we desire.'
He said, 'O would that I had power against you, or might take refuge in a strong pillar!'
They said, 'Lot, we are messengers of thy Lord.
They shall not reach thee; so set forth, thou with thy family, in a watch of the night, and let not any one of you turn round, excepting thy wife; surely she shall be smitten by that which smites them.
Their promised time is the morning; is the morning not nigh?'
So when Our command came, We turned it uppermost nethermost, and rained on it stones of baked clay, one on another,
marked with thy Lord, and never far from the evildoers.
And to Midian their brother Shuaib; he said, 'O my people, serve God!
You have no god other than He.
And diminish not the measure and the balance.
I see you are prospering; and I fear for you the chastisement of an encompassing day.
O my people, fill up the measure and the balance justly, and do not diminish the goods of the people, and do not mischief in the land, working corruption.
God's remainder is better for you, if you are believers.
And I am not a guardian over you.
They said, 'Shuaib, does thy prayer command thee that we should leave that our fathers served, or to do as we will with our goods?
Thou art the clement one, the right-minded.'
He said, 'O my people, what think you?
If I stand upon a clear sign from my Lord, and He has provided me with fair provision from Him -- and I desire not to come behind you, betaking me to that I forbid you; I desire only to set things right, so far as I am able.
My succour is only with God; in Him I have put my trust, and to Him I turn, penitent.
O my people, let not the breach with me move you, so that there smite you the like of what smote the people of Noah, or the people of Hood, or the people of Salih; and the people of Lot are not far away from you.
And ask forgiveness of your Lord, then repent to Him; surely my Lord is All-compassionate, All-loving.'
They said, 'Shuaib, we do not understand much of what thou sayest.
Truly we see thee weak among us; but for thy tribe we would have stoned thee; for thou art not strong against us.
He said, 'O my people, is my tribe stronger against you than God?
And Him -- have you taken Him as something to be thrust behind you?
My Lord encompasses the things you do.
O my people, act according to your station; I am acting; and certainly you will know to whom will come the chastisement degrading him, and who is a liar.
And be upon the watch; I shall be with you, watching.'
And when Our command came, We delivered Shuaib and those who believed with him by a mercy from Us, and the evildoers were seized by the Cry, and morning found them in their habitations fallen prostrate
as if they had never dwelt there: 'So away with Midian, even as Thamood was done away!'
And We sent Moses with Our signs, and a manifest authority,
to Pharaoh and his Council; but they followed Pharaoh's command, and Pharaoh's command was not right-minded.
He shall go before his people on the Day of Resurrection, and will have led them down to the Fire-evil the watering-place to be led down to!
And there was sent following after them in this world a curse, and upon the Day of Resurrection -- evil the offering to be offered!
That is of the tidings of the cities We relate to thee; some of them are standing and some stubble.
And We wronged them not, but they wronged themselves; their gods availed them not that they called upon, apart from God, anything, when the command of thy Lord came; and they increased them not, save in destruction.
Such is the seizing of thy Lord, when He seizes the cities that are evildoing; surely His seizing is painful, terrible.
Surely in that is a sign for him who fears the chastisement in the world to come; that is a day mankind are to be gathered to, a day to witness,
and We shall not postpone it, save to a term reckoned;
the day it comes, no soul shall speak save by His leave; some of them shall be wretched and some happy.
As for the wretched, they shall be in the Fire, wherein there shall be for them moaning and sighing, therein dwelling forever,
so long as the heavens and earth abide, save as thy Lord will; surely thy Lord accomplishes what He desires.
And as for the happy, they shall be in Paradise, therein dwelling forever, so long as the heavens and earth abide, save as thy Lord will -- for a gift unbroken.
So be thou not in doubt concerning what these men serve; they serve only as their fathers served before; and We shall surely pay them in full their portion undiminished.
And We gave Moses the Book; and there was difference regarding it, and but for a word that preceded from thy Lord, it had been decided between them; and they are in doubt of it disquieting.
Surely each one of them -- thy Lord will pay them in full for their works; He is aware of the things they do.
So go thou straight, as thou hast been commanded, and whoso repents with thee; and be you not insolent; surely He sees the things you do.
And lean not on the evildoers, so that the Fire touches you -- you have no protectors apart from God -- and then you will not be helped.
And perform the prayer at the two ends of the day and nigh of the night; surely the good deeds will drive away the evil deeds.
That is a remembrance unto the mindful.
And be thou patient; God will not leave to waste the wage of the good-doers.
Or if there had been, of the generations before you, men of a remainder forbidding corruption in the earth -- except a few of those whom We delivered of them; but the evildoers followed the ease they were given to exult in and became sinners.
Yet thy Lord would never destroy the cities unjustly, while as yet their people were putting things right.
Had thy Lord willed, He would have made mankind one nation; but they continue in their differences
excepting those on whom thy Lord has mercy.
To that end He created them, and perfectly is fulfilled the word of thy Lord: 'I shall assuredly fill Gehenna with jinn and men all together.'
And all that We relate to thee of the tidings of the Messengers is that whereby We strengthen thy heart; in these there has come to thee the truth and an admonition, and a reminder to the believers.
And say to the unbelievers: 'Act you according to your station; we are acting.
And watch and wait; we are also watching and waiting.'
To God belongs the Unseen in the heavens and the earth. To Him the whole matter shall be returned; so serve Him, and put thy trust in Him.
Thy Lord is not heedless of the things you do.
Alif Lam Ra. Those are the signs of the Manifest Book.
We have sent it down as an Arabic Koran; haply you will understand.
We will relate to thee the fairest of stories in that We have revealed to thee this Koran, though before it thou wast one of the heedless.
When Joseph said to his father, 'Father, I saw eleven stars, and the sun and the moon; I saw them bowing down before me.'
He said, 'O my son, relate not thy vision to thy brothers, lest they devise against thee some guile. Surely Satan is to man a manifest enemy.
So will thy Lord choose thee, and teach thee the interpretation of tales, and perfect His blessing upon thee and upon the House of Jacob, as He perfected it formerly on thy fathers Abraham and Isaac; surely thy Lord is All-knowing, All-wise.'
(In Joseph and his brethren were signs for those who ask questions.)
When they said, 'Surely Joseph and his brother are dearer to our father than we, though we are a band.
Surely our father is in manifest error.
Kill you Joseph, or cast him forth into some land, that your father's face may be free for you, and thereafter you may be a righteous people.'
One of them said, 'No, kill not Joseph, but cast him into the bottom of the pit and some traveller will pick him out, if you do aught.'
They said, 'Father, what ails thee, that thou trustest us not with Joseph? Surely we are his sincere well-wishers.
Send him forth with us tomorrow, to frolic and play; surely we shall be watching over him.'
He said, 'It grieves me that you should go with him, and I fear the wolf may eat him, while you are heedless of him.'
They said, 'If the wolf eats him, and we a band, then are we losers!'
So when they went with him, and agreed to put him in the bottom of the well, and We revealed to him, 'Thou shalt tell them of this their doing when they are unaware.'
And they came to their father in the evening, and they were weeping.
They said, 'Father, we went running races, and left Joseph behind with our things; so the wolf ate him. But thou wouldst never believe us, though we spoke truly.'
And they brought his shirt with false blood on it.
He said, 'No; but your spirits tempted you to do somewhat.
But come, sweet patience!
And God's succour is ever there to seek against that you describe.'
Then came travellers, and they sent one of them, a water-drawer, who let down his bucket.
'Good news!' he said.
'Here is a young man.'
So they hid him as merchandise; but God knew what they were doing.
Then they sold him for a paltry price, a handful of counted dirhams; for they set small store by him.
He that bought him, being of Egypt, said to his wife, 'Give him goodly lodging, and it may be that he will profit us, or we may take him for our own son.'
So We established Joseph in the land, and that We might teach him the interpretation of tales.
God prevails in His purpose, but most men know not.
And when he was fully grown, We gave him judgment and knowledge.
Even so We recompense the good-doers.
Now the woman in whose house he was solicited him, and closed the doors on them.
'Come,' she said, 'take me!'
'God be my refuge,' he said.
'Surely my lord has given me a goodly lodging.
Surely the evildoers do not prosper.
For she desired him; and he would have taken her, but that he saw the proof of his Lord.
So was it, that We might turn away from him evil and abomination; he was one of Our devoted servants.
They raced to the door; and she tore his shirt from behind. They encountered her master by the door.
She said, 'What is the recompense of him who purposes evil against thy folk, but that he should be imprisoned, or a painful chastisement?'
Said he, 'It was she that solicited me'; and a witness of her folk bore witness, 'If his shirt has been torn from before then she has spoken truly, and he is one of the liars;
but if it be that his shirt has been torn from behind, then she has lied, and he is one of the truthful.'
When he saw his shirt was torn from behind he said, 'This is of your women's guile; surely your guile is great.
Joseph, turn away from this; and thou, woman, ask forgiveness of thy crime; surely thou art one of the sinners.'
Certain women that were in the city said, 'The Governor's wife has been soliciting her page; he smote her heart with love; we see her in manifest error.
When she heard their sly whispers, she sent to them, and made ready for them a repast, then she gave to each one of them a knife. 'Come forth, attend to them,' she said.
And when they saw him, they so admired him that they cut their hands, saying, 'God save us!
This is no mortal; he is no other but a noble angel.'
'So now you see, she said. 'This is he you blamed me for.
Yes, I solicited him, but he abstained.
Yet if he will not do what I command him, he shall be imprisoned, and be one of the humbled.'
He said, 'My Lord, prison is dearer to me than that they call me to; yet if Thou turnest not from me their guile, then I shall yearn towards them, and so become one of the ignorant.'
So his Lord answered him, and He turned away from him their guile; surely He is the All-hearing, the All-knowing.
Then it seemed good to them, after they had seen the signs, that they should imprison him for a while.
And there entered the prison with him two youths.
Said one of them, 'I dreamed that I was pressing grapes.
Said the other, 'I dreamed that I was carrying on my head bread, that birds were eating of.
Tell us its interpretation; we see that thou art of the good-doers.'
He said, 'No food shall come to you for your sustenance, but ere it comes to you I shall tell you its interpretation.
That I shall tell you is of what God has taught me.
I have forsaken the creed of a people who believe not in God and who moreover are unbelievers in the world to come.
And I have followed the creed of my fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
Not ours is it to associate aught with God.
That is of God's bounty to us, and to men; but most men are not thankful.
Say, which is better, my fellow-prisoners -- many gods at variance, or God the One, the Omnipotent?
That which you serve, apart from Him, is nothing but names yourselves have named, you and your fathers; God has sent down no authority touching them.
Judgment belongs only to God; He has commanded that you shall not serve any but Him.
That is the right religion; but most men know not.
Fellow-prisoners, as for one of you, he shall pour wine for his lord; as for the other, he shall be crucified, and birds will eat of his head.
The matter is decided whereon you enquire.'
Then he said to the one he deemed should be saved of the two, 'Mention me in thy lord's presence.'
But Satan caused him to forget to mention him to his master, so that he continued in the prison for certain years.
And the king said, 'I saw in a dream seven fat kine, and seven lean ones devouring them; likewise seven green ears of corn, and seven withered.
My counsellors, pronounce to me upon my dream, if you are expounders of dreams.'
'A hotchpotch of nightmares!' they said.
'We know nothing of the interpretation of nightmares.'
Then said the one who had been delivered, remembering after a time, 'I will myself tell you its interpretation; so send me forth.'
'Joseph, thou true man, pronounce to us regarding seven fat kine, that seven lean ones were devouring, seven green ears of corn, and seven withered; haply I shall return to the men, haply they will know.'
He said, 'You shall sow seven years after your wont; what you have harvested leave in the ear, excepting a little whereof you eat.
Then thereafter there shall come upon you seven hard years, that shall devour what you have laid up for them, all but a little you keep in store.
Then thereafter there shall come a year wherein the people will be succoured and press in season.
The king said, 'Bring him to me!'
And when the messenger came to him, he said, 'Return unto thy lord, and ask of him, "What of the women who cut their hands?" Surely my Lord has knowledge of their guile.'
'What was your business, women,' he said, 'when you solicited Joseph?'
'God save us!' they said.
'We know no evil against him.'
The Governor's wife said, 'Now the truth is at last discovered; I solicited him; he is a truthful man.
'That, so that he may know I betrayed him not secretly, and that God guides not the guile of the treacherous.
Yet I claim not that my soul was innocent -- surely the soul of man incites to evil -- except inasmuch as my Lord had mercy; truly my Lord is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.'
The king said, 'Bring him to me! I would attach him to my person.'
Then, when he had spoken with him, he said, 'Today thou art established firmly in our favour and in our trust.'
He said, 'Set me over the land's storehouses; I am a knowing guardian.'
So We established Joseph in the land, to make his dwelling there wherever he would.
We visit with Our mercy whomsoever We will, and We leave not to waste the wage of the good-doers.
Yet is the wage of the world to come better for those who believe, and are godfearing.
And the brethren of Joseph came, and entered unto him, and he knew them, but they knew him not.
When he had equipped them with their equipment be said, 'Bring me a certain brother of yours from your father.
Do you not see that I fill up the measure, and am the best of hosts?
But if you bring him not to me, there shall be no measure for you with me, neither shall you come nigh me.'
They said, 'We will solicit him of our father; that we will do.'
He said to his pages, 'Put their merchandise in their saddlebags; haply they will recognize it when they have turned to their people; haply they will return.
So, when they had returned to their father, they said, 'Father, the measure was denied to us; so send with us our brother, that we may obtain the measure; surely we shall be watching over him.'
He said, 'And shall I entrust him to you otherwise than as I entrusted before his brother to you?
Why, God is the best guardian, and He is the most merciful of the merciful.'
And when they opened their things, they found their merchandise, restored to them.
'Father,' they said, 'what more should we desire?
See, our merchandise here is restored to us.
We shall get provision for our family, and we shall be watching over our brother; we shall obtain an extra camel's load -- that is an easy measure.
He said, 'Never will I send him with you until you bring me a solemn pledge by God that you will surely bring him back to me unless it be that you are encompassed.'
When they had brought him their solemn pledge he said, 'God shall be Guardian over what we say.'
He also said, 'O my sons, enter not by one door; enter by separate doors. Yet I cannot avail you anything against God; judgment belongs not to any but God.
In Him I have put my trust; and in Him let all put their trust who put their trust.'
And when they entered after the manner their father commanded them, it availed them nothing against God; but it was a need in Jacob's soul that he so satisfied. Verily he was possessed of a knowledge for that We had taught him; but most men know not.
And when they entered unto Joseph, he said, taking his brother into his arms, 'I am thy brother; so do not despair of that they have done.'
Then, when he had equipped them with their equipment, he put his drinking-cup into the saddlebag of his brother.
Then a herald proclaimed, 'Ho, cameleers, you are robbers!'
They said, turning to them, 'What is it that you are missing?'
They said, 'We are missing the king's goblet. Whoever brings it shall receive a camel's load; that I guarantee.'
'By God,' they said, 'you know well that we came not to work corruption in the land. We are not robbers.'
They said, 'And what shall be its recompense if you are liars?'
They said, 'This shall be its recompense -- in whoever's saddlebag the goblet is found, he shall be its recompense.
So we recompense the evildoers.'
So he made beginning with their sacks, before his brother's sack, then he pulled it out of his brother's sack.
So We contrived for Joseph's sake; he could not have taken his brother, according to the king's doom, except that God willed.
Whomsoever We will, We raise in rank; over every man of knowledge is One who knows.
They said, 'If he is a thief, a brother of his was a thief before.'
But Joseph secreted it in his soul and disclosed it not to them, saying, 'You are in a worse case; God knows very well what you are describing.'
They said, 'Mighty prince, he has a father, aged and great with years; so take one of us in his place; we see that thou art one of the good-doers.'
He said, 'God forbid that we should take any other but him in whose possession we found the goods; for if we did so, we would be evildoers.'
When they despaired of moving him, they conferred privily apart.
Said the eldest of them, 'Do you not know how your father has taken a solemn pledge from you by God, and aforetime you failed regarding Joseph?
Never will I quit this land, until my father gives me leave, or God judges in my favour; He is the best of judges.
Return you all to your father, and say, "Father, thy son stole; we do not testify except that we know; we were no guardians of the Unseen.
Enquire of the city wherein we were, and the caravan in which we approached; surely we are truthful men".'
'No!' he said 'But your spirits tempted you to do somewhat.
But come, sweet patience!
Haply God will bring them all to me; He is the All-knowing, the All-wise.'
And he turned away from them, and said, 'Ah, woe is me for Joseph!'
And his eyes turned white because of the sorrow that he choked within him.
'By God,' they said, 'thou wilt never cease mentioning Joseph till thou art consumed, or among the perishing.'
He said, 'I make complaint of my anguish and my sorrow unto God; I know from God that you know not.
Depart, my sons, and search out tidings of Joseph and his brother. Do not despair of God's comfort; of God's comfort no man despairs, excepting the people of the unbelievers.'
So, when they entered unto him, they said, 'O mighty prince, affliction has visited us and our people. We come with merchandise of scant worth.
Fill up to us the measure, and be charitable to us; surely God recompenses the charitable.'
He said, 'Are you aware of what you did with Joseph and his brother, when you were ignorant?'
They said, 'Why, art thou indeed Joseph?'
'I am Joseph,' he said. 'This is my brother.
God has indeed been gracious unto us.
Whosoever fears God, and is patient -- surely God leaves not to waste the wage of the good-doers.
'By God,' they said, 'God has indeed preferred thee above us, and certainly we have been sinful.'
He said, 'No reproach this day shall be on you; God will forgive you; He is the most merciful of the merciful.
Go, take this shirt, and do you cast it on my father's face, and he shall recover his sight; then bring me your family all together.'
So, when the caravan set forth, their father said, 'Surely I perceive Joseph's scent, unless you think me doting.'
They said, 'By God, thou art certainly in thy ancient error.
But when the bearer of good tidings came to him, and laid it on his face, forthwith he saw once again.
He said, 'Did I not tell you I know from God that you know not?'
They said, 'Our father, ask forgiveness of our crimes for us; for certainly we have been sinful.'
He said, 'Assuredly I will ask my Lord to forgive you; He is the All-forgiving, the All-compassionate.'
So, when they entered unto Joseph, he took his father and mother into his arms saying, 'Enter you into Egypt, if God will, in security.'
And he lifted his father and mother upon the throne; and the others fell down prostrate before him.
'See, father,' he said, 'this is the interpretation of my vision of long ago; my Lord has made it true.
He was good to me when He brought me forth from the prison, and again when He brought you out of the desert, after that Satan set at variance me and my brethren.
My Lord is gentle to what He will; He is the All-knowing, the All-wise.
O my Lord, Thou hast given me to rule, and Thou hast taught me the interpretation of tales.
O Thou, the Originator of the heavens and earth, Thou art my Protector in this world and the next.
O receive me to Thee in true submission, and join me with the righteous.'
That is of the tidings of the Unseen that We reveal to thee; thou wast not with them when they agreed upon their plan, devising.
Yet, be thou ever so eager, the most part of men believe not.
Thou askest of them no wage for it; it is nothing but a reminder unto all beings.
How many a sign there is in the heavens and in the earth that they pass by, turning away from it!
And the most part of them believe not in God, but they associate other gods with Him.
Do they feel secure that there shall come upon them no enveloping of the chastisement of God, or that the Hour shall not come upon them suddenly when they are unaware?
Say: 'This is my way. I call to God with sure knowledge, I and whoever follows after me.
To God be glory! And I am not among the idolaters.'
We sent not forth any before thee, but men We revealed to of the people living in the cities.
Have they not journeyed in the land? Have they not beheld how was the end of those before them?.
Surely the abode of the world to come is better for those that are godfearing.
What, do you not understand?
Till, when the Messengers despaired, deeming they were counted liars, Our help came to them and whosoever We willed was delivered.
Our might will never be turned back from the people of the sinners.
In their stories is surely a lesson to men possessed of minds; it is not a tale forged, but a confirmation of what is before it, and a distinguishing of every thing, and a guidance, and a mercy to a people who believe.
Alif Lam Mim Ra.
Those are the signs of the Book; and that which has been sent down to thee from thy Lord is the truth, but most men do not believe.
God is He who raised up the heavens without pillars you can see, then He sat Himself upon the Throne.
He subjected the sun and the moon, each one running to a term stated.
He directs the affair; He distinguishes the signs; haply you will have faith in the encounter with your Lord.
It is He who stretched out the earth and set therein firm mountains and rivers, and of every fruit He placed there two kinds, covering the day with the night.
Surely in that are signs for a people who reflect.
And on the earth are tracts neighbouring each to each, and gardens of vines, and fields sown, and palms in pairs, and palms single, watered with one water; and some of them We prefer in produce above others.
Surely in that are signs for a people who understand.
If thou wouldst wonder, surely wonderful is their saying, 'What, when we are dust shall we indeed then be raised up again in new creation?'
Those are they that disbelieve in their Lord; those -- on their necks are fetters; those shall be the inhabitants of the Fire, therein dwelling forever.
They would have thee hasten the evil ere the good; yet there have passed away before them examples.
Thy Lord is forgiving to men, for all their evil-doing, and thy Lord is terrible in retribution.
The unbelievers say, 'Why has a sign not been sent down upon him from his Lord?'
Thou art only a warner, and a guide to every people.
God knows what every female bears, and the wombs' shrinking and swelling; everything with Him has its measure --
the Knower of the unseen and the visible, the All-great, the All-exalted:
Alike of you is he who conceals his -- saying, and he who proclaims it, he who hides himself in the night, and he who sallies by day;
he has attendant angels, before him and behind him, watching over him by God's command.
God changes not what is in a people, until they change what is in themselves.
Whensover God desires evil for a people, there is no turning it back; apart from Him, they have no protector.
It is He who shows you the lightning, for fear and hope, and produces the heavy clouds;
the thunder proclaims. His praise, and the angels, in awe of Him.
He looses the thunderbolts, and smites with them whomsoever He will; yet they dispute about God, who is mighty in power.
To Him is the call of truth; and those upon whom they call, apart from Him, answer them nothing, but it is as a man who stretches out his hands to water that it may reach his mouth, and it reaches it not.
The prayer of the unbelievers goes only astray.
To God bow all who are in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly, as do their shadows also in the mornings and the evenings.
Say: 'Who is the Lord of the heavens and of the earth?'
Say: 'God.'
Say: 'Then have you taken unto you others beside Him to be your protectors, even such as have no power to profit or hurt themselves?'
Say: 'Are the blind and the seeing man equal, or are the shadows and the light equal?
Or have they ascribed to God associates who created as He created, so that creation is all alike to them?'
Say: 'God is the Creator of everything, and He is the One, the Omnipotent.'
He sends down out of heaven water, and the wadis flow each in its measure, and the torrent carries a swelling scum; and out of that over which they kindle fire, being desirous of ornament or ware, out of that rises a scum the like of it.
So God strikes both the true and the false.
As for the scum, it vanishes as jetsam, and what profits men abides in the earth.
Even so God strikes His similitudes.
For those who answer their Lord, the reward most fair; and those who answer Him not -- if they possessed all that is in the earth and the like of it with it, they would offer it for their ransom.
Those theirs shall be the evil reckoning, and their refuge shall be Gehenna -- an evil cradling!
What, is he who knows what is sent down to thee from thy Lord is the truth, like him who is blind?
Only men possessed of minds remember;
who fulfil God's covenant, and break not the compact,
who join what God has commanded shall be joined, and fear their Lord, and dread the evil reckoning,
patient men, desirous of the Face of their Lord, who perform the prayer, and expend of that We have provided them, secretly and in public, and who avert evil with good -- theirs shall be the Ultimate Abode,
Gardens of Eden which they shall enter; and those who were righteous of their fathers, and their wives, and their seed, shall enter them, and the angels shall enter unto them from every gate:
'Peace be upon you, for that you were patient.' Fair is the Ultimate Abode.
And those who break the covenant of God after His compact, and who snap what God has commanded to be joined, and who work corruption in the earth -- theirs shall be the curse, and theirs the Evil Abode.
God outspreads and straitens His provision unto whomsoever He will.
They rejoice in this present life; and this present life, beside the world to come, is naught but passing enjoyment.
The unbelievers say, 'Why has a sign not been sent down upon him from his Lord?'
Say: 'God leads astray whomsoever He will, and He guides to Him all who are penitent.'
Those who believe, their hearts being at rest in God's remembrance -- in God's remembrance are at rest the hearts
of those who believe and do righteous deeds; theirs is blessedness and a fair resort.
Thus We have sent thee among a nation before which other nations have passed away, to recite to them that We have revealed to thee; and yet they disbelieve in the All-merciful.
Say: 'He is my Lord -- there is no god but He.
In Him I have put my trust, and to Him I turn.'
If only a Koran whereby the mountains were set in motion, or the earth were cleft, or the dead were spoken to -- nay, but God's is the affair altogether.
Did not the believers know that, if God had willed, He would have guided men all together?
And still the unbelievers are smitten by a shattering for what they wrought, or it alights nigh their habitation, until God's promise comes; and God will not fail the tryst.
Messengers indeed were scoffed at before thee, and I respited the unbelievers; then I seized them -- and how was my retribution?
What, He who stands over every soul for what it has earned? -- And yet they ascribe to God associates.
Say: 'Name them!
Or will you tell Him what He knows not in the earth?
Or in apparent words?'
Nay; but decked out fair to the unbelievers is their devising, and they are barred from the way; and whomsoever God leads astray, no guide has he.
For them is chastisement in the present life; and the chastisement of the world to come is yet more grievous; they have none to defend them from God.
The likeness of Paradise, that is promised to the godfearing: beneath it rivers flow, its produce is eternal, and its shade.
That is the requital of the god-fearing; and the requital of the unbelievers is -- the Fire!
And those to whom We have given the Book rejoice in what is sent down unto thee; and of the parties some reject some of it.
Say: 'I have only been commanded to serve God, and not to associate aught with Him.
To Him I call, and to Him I turn.'
Even so We have sent it down as an Arabic judgment.
And if thou dost follow their caprices, after the knowledge that has come to thee, thou shalt have no protector against God, and no defender.
And We sent Messengers before thee, and We assigned to them wives, and seed; and it was not for any Messengers to bring a sign, but by God's leave.
Every term has a Book.
God blots out, and He establishes whatsoever He will; and with Him is the Essence of the Book.
Whether We show thee a part of that We promise them, or We call thee to Us, it is thine only to deliver the Message, and Ours the reckoning.
Have they not seen how We come to the land diminishing it in its extremities?
God judges; none repels His judgment; He is swift at the reckoning.
Those that were before them devised; but God's is the devising altogether.
He knows what every soul earns. The unbelievers shall assuredly know whose will be the Ultimate Abode.
The unbelievers say, 'Thou art not an Envoy.'
Say: 'God suffices as a witness between me and you, and whosoever possesses knowledge of the Book.'
Alif Lam Ra. A Book We have sent down to thee that thou mayest bring forth mankind from the shadows to the light by the leave of their Lord, to the path of the All-mighty, the All-laudable,
God, to whom belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth.
And woe to the unbelievers for a terrible chastisement,
such as prefer the present life over the world to come, and bar from God's way, desiring to make it crooked -- they are in far error.
And We have sent no Messenger save with the tongue of his people, that he might make all clear to them; then God leads astray whomsoever He will, and He guides whomsoever He will; and He is the All-mighty, the All-wise.
And We sent Moses with Our signs -- 'Bring forth thy people from the shadows to the light and remind thou them of the Days of God.'
Surely in that are signs for every man enduring, thankful!
And when Moses said to his people, 'Remember God's blessing upon you when He delivered you from the folk of Pharaoh, who were visiting you with evil chastisement, slaughtering your sons, and sparing your women -- and in that was a grievous trial from your Lord.
And when your Lord proclaimed, "If you are thankful, surely I will increase you, but if you are thankless My chastisement is surely terrible."'
And Moses said, 'If you are thankless, you and whoso is on earth, all together, yet assuredly God is All-sufficient, All-laudable.'
Has there not come to you the tidings of those who were before you -- the people of Noah, Ad, Thamood, and of those after them whom none knows but God?
Their Messengers came to them with the clear signs; but they thrust their hands into their mouths, saying, 'We certainly disbelieve in the Message you have been sent with, and we are in doubt, concerning that you call us unto, disquieting.'
Their Messengers said, 'Is there any doubt regarding God, the Originator of the heavens and the earth, who calls you so that He may forgive you your sins, and defer you to a term stated?'
They said, 'You are nothing but mortals, like us; you desire to bar us from that our fathers served; then bring us a manifest authority.'
Their Messengers said to them, 'We are nothing but mortals, like you; but God is gracious unto whomsoever He will of His servants.
It is not for us to bring you an authority save by the leave of God; and in God let the believers put all their trust.
And why should we not put our trust in God, seeing that He has guided us in our ways?
We will surely endure patiently, whatever you hurt us; and in God let all put their trust who put their trust.'
The unbelievers said to their Messengers, 'We will assuredly expel you from our land, or you will surely return into our creed.'
Then did their Lord reveal unto them: 'We will surely destroy the evildoers,
and We will surely make you to dwell in the land after them -- that, for him who fears My station and fears My threat.'
They sought a judgment; then was disappointed every froward tyrant --
beyond him Gehenna, and he is given to drink of oozing pus,
the which he gulps, and can scarce swallow, and death comes upon him from every side, yet he cannot die; and still beyond him is a harsh chastisement.
The likeness of those who disbelieve in their Lord: their works are as ashes, whereon the wind blows strong upon a tempestuous day; they have no power over that they have earned - that is the far error!
Hast thou not seen that God created the heavens and the earth in truth?
If He will, He can put you away and bring a new creation;
that is surely no great matter for God.
They sally forth unto God, all together; then say the weak to those who waxed proud, 'We were your followers; will you avail us against the chastisement of God anything?'
They say, 'If God had guided us, we would have guided you.
Alike it is for us whether we cannot endure, or whether we are patient; we have no asylum.'
And Satan says, when the issue is decided, 'God surely promised you a true promise; and I promised you, then I failed you, for I had no authority over you, but that I called you, and you answered me.
So do not blame me, but blame yourselves; I cannot aid you, neither can you aid me.
I disbelieved in your associating me with God aforetime.'
As for the evildoers, for them awaits a painful chastisement;
but as for those who believe, and do deeds of righteousness, they shall be admitted to gardens underneath which rivers flow, therein dwelling forever, by the leave of their Lord, their greeting therein: 'Peace!'
Hast thou not seen how God has struck a similitude?
A good word is as a good tree -- its roots are firm, and its branches are in heaven;
it gives its produce every season by the leave of its Lord.
So God strikes similitudes for men; haply they will remember.
And the likeness of a corrupt word is as a corrupt tree -- uprooted from the earth, having no stablishment.
God confirms those who believe with the firm word, in the present life and in the world to come; and God leads astray the evildoers; and God does what He will.
Hast thou not seen those who exchanged the bounty of God with unthankfulness, and caused their people to dwell in the abode of ruin? --
Gehenna, wherein they are roasted; an evil stablishment!
And they set up compeers to God, that they might lead astray from His way.
Say: 'Take your joy! Your homecoming shall be -- the Fire!'
Say to My servants who believe, that they perform the prayer, and expend of that We have provided them, secretly and in public, before a day comes wherein shall be neither bargaining nor befriending.
It is God who created the heavens and the earth, and sent down out of heaven water wherewith He brought forth fruits to be your sustenance. And He subjected to you the ships to run upon the sea at His commandment; and He subjected to you the rivers
and He subjected to you the sun and moon constant upon their courses, and He subjected to you the night and day,
and gave you of all you asked Him. If you count God's blessing, you will never number it; surely man is sinful, unthankful!
And when Abraham said, 'My Lord, make this land secure, and turn me and my sons away from serving idols;
my Lord, they have led astray many men.
Then whoso follows me belongs to me; and whoso rebels against me, surely Thou art All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
Our Lord, I have made some of my seed to dwell in a valley where is no sown land by Thy Holy House; Our Lord, let them perform the prayer, and make hearts of men yearn towards them, and provide them with fruits; haply they will be thankful.
Our Lord, Thou knowest what we keep secret and what we publish; from God nothing whatever is hidden in earth and heaven.
Praise be to God, who has given me, though I am old, Ishmael and Isaac; surely my Lord hears the petition.
My Lord, make me a performer of the prayer, and of my seed.
Our Lord, and receive my petition.
Our Lord, forgive Thou me and my parents, and the believers, upon the day when the reckoning shall come to pass.
Deem not that God is heedless of what the evildoers work; He is only deferring them to a day when eyes shall stare,
when they shall run with necks outstretched and heads erect, their glances never returned on themselves, their hearts void.
And warn mankind of the day when the chastisement comes on them, And those who did evil shall say, 'Our Lord, defer us to a near term, and we will answer Thy call, and follow the Messengers.'
'Ah, but did you not swear aforetime there should be no removing for you?
And you dwelt in the dwelling-places of those who wronged themselves, and it became clear to you how We did with them, and how We struck similitudes for you.
They devised their devising, and their devising is known to God; though their devising were such as to remove mountains.'
So do not deem that God will fail in His promise to His Messengers; surely God is All-mighty, Vengeful.
Upon the day the earth shall be changed to other than the earth, and the heavens and they sally forth unto God, the One, the Omnipotent.
And thou shalt see the sinners that day coupled in fetters,
of pitch their shirts, their faces enveloped by the Fire,
that God may recompense every soul for its earnings; surely God is swift at the reckoning.
This is a Message to be delivered to mankind that they may be warned by it, and that they may know that He is One God, and that all possessed of minds may remember.
Alif Lam Ra. Those are the signs of the Book and of a manifest Koran.
Perchance the unbelievers will wish that they had surrendered:
leave them to eat, and to take their joy, and to be bemused by hope; certainly they will soon know!
Never a city have We destroyed, but it had a known decree,
and no nation outstrips its term, nor do they put it back.
They say: 'Thou, upon whom the Remembrance is sent down, thou art assuredly possessed!
Why dost thou not bring the angels unto us, if thou speakest truly?'
We send not down the angels, save with truth;
then they would not be respited. It is We who have sent down the Remembrance, and We watch over it.
Indeed, We sent Messengers before thee, among the factions of the ancients,
and not a single Messenger came to them, but they mocked at him;
even so We cause it to enter into the hearts of the sinners --
they believe not in it, though the wont of the ancients is already gone.
Though We opened to them a gate in heaven, and still they mounted through it,
yet would they say, 'Our eyes have been dazzled; nay, we are a people bewitched!'
We have set in heaven constellations and decked them out fair to the beholders,
and guarded them from every accursed Satan
excepting such as listens by stealth -- and he is pursued by a manifest flame.
And the earth -- We stretched it forth, and cast on it firm mountains, and We caused to grow therein of every thing justly weighed,
and there appointed for you livelihood, and for those you provide not for.
Naught is there, but its treasuries are with Us, and We send it not down but in a known measure.
And We loose the winds fertilising, and We send down out of heaven water, then We give it to you to drink, and you are not its treasurers.
It is We who give life, and make to die, and it is We who are the inheritors.
We know the ones of you who press forward, and We know the laggards;
and it is thy Lord shall muster them, and He is All-wise, All-knowing.
Surely We created man of a clay of mud moulded,
and the jinn created We before of fire flaming.
And when thy Lord said to the angels, 'See, I am creating a mortal of a clay of mud moulded.
When I have shaped him, and breathed My spirit in him, fall you down, bowing before him!'
Then the angels bowed themselves all together,
save Iblis; he refused to be among those bowing.
Said He, 'What ails thee, Iblis, that thou art not among those bowing?'
Said he, 'I would never bow myself before a mortal whom Thou hast created of a clay of mud moulded.'
Said He, 'Then go thou forth hence; thou art accursed.
Upon thee shall rest the curse, till the Day of Doom.'
Said he, 'My Lord, respite me till the day they shall be raised.'
Said He, 'Thou art among the ones that are respited
unto the day of a known time.'
Said he, 'My Lord, for Thy perverting me I shall deck all fair to them in the earth, and I shall pervert them, all together,
excepting those Thy servants among them that are devoted.
Said He, 'This is for Me a straight path:
over My servants thou shalt have no authority, except those that follow thee,
being perverse; Gehenna shall be their promised land all together.
Seven gates it has, and unto each gate a set portion of them belongs.'
But the godfearing shall be amidst gardens and fountains:
'Enter you them, in peace and security!'
We shall strip away all rancour that is in their breasts; as brothers they shall be upon couches set face to face;
no fatigue there shall smite them, neither shall they ever be driven forth from there.
Tell My servants I am the All-forgiving, the All-compassionate,
and that My chastisement is the painful chastisement.
And tell them of the guests of Abraham,
when they entered unto him, saying, 'Peace!' He said, 'Behold, we are afraid of you.'
They said, 'Be not afraid; behold, we give thee good tidings of a cunning boy.'
He said, 'What, do you give me good tidings, though old age has smitten me?
Of what do you
They said, 'We give thee good tidings of truth. Be not of those that despair.'
He said, 'And who despairs of the mercy of his Lord, excepting those that are astray?'
He said, 'And what is your business, envoys?'
They said, 'We have been sent unto a people of sinners,
excepting the folk of Lot; them we shall deliver
all together, excepting his wife -- we have decreed, she shall surely be of those that tarry.'
So, when the envoys came to the folk of Lot,
he said, 'Surely you are a people unknown to me!'
They said, 'Nay, but we have brought thee that concerning which they were doubting.
We have come to thee with the truth, and assuredly we speak truly.
So set forth, thou with thy family, in a watch of the night, and follow after the backs of them, and let not any one of you turn round; and depart unto the place you are commanded.'
And We decreed for him that commandment, that the last remnant of those should be cut off in the morning.
And the people of the city came rejoicing.
He said, 'These are my guests; put me not to shame,
and fear God, and do not degrade me.'
They said, 'Have we not forbidden thee all beings?'
He said, 'These are my daughters, if you would be doing.'
By thy life, they wandered blindly in their dazzlement,
and the Cry seized them at the sunrise,
and We turned it uppermost nethermost and rained on it stones of baked clay.
Surely in that are signs for such as mark;
surely it is on a way yet remaining;
surely in that is a sign for believers.
Certainly the dwellers in the Thicket were evildoers,
and We took vengeance on them.
The two of them were upon a roadway manifest.
The dwellers in El-Hijr cried lies to the Envoys.
We brought them. Our signs, and they turned away from them.
They were hewing the mountains into houses, therein dwelling securely;
and the Cry seized them in the morning;
that they earned did not avail them.
We created not the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them, save in truth. Surely the Hour is coming; so pardon thou, with a gracious pardoning.
Surely thy Lord, He is the All-creator, the All-knowing.
We have given thee seven of the oft-repeated, and the mighty Koran.
Stretch not thine eyes to that We have given pairs of them to enjoy; and do not sorrow for them, and lower thy wing unto the believers,
and say, 'Surely, I am the manifest warner.'
So We sent it down to the partitioners,
who have broken the Koran into fragments.
Now by thy Lord, We shall surely question them all together
concerning that they were doing.
So shout that thou art commanded and turn thou away from the idolaters.
We suffice thee against the mockers,
even against those who set up with God another god. Certainly they will soon know!
We know indeed thy breast is straitened by the things they say.
Proclaim thy Lord's praise, and be of those that bow,
and serve thy Lord, until the Certain comes to thee.
God's command comes; so seek not to hasten it. Glory be to Him!
High be He exalted above that they associate with Him!
He sends down the angels with the Spirit of His command upon whomsoever He will among His servants, saying: Give you warning that there is no God but I; so fear you Me!
He created the heavens and the earth in truth; high be He exalted above that they associate With Him!
He created man of a sperm-drop; and, behold, he is a manifest adversary.
And the cattle -- He created them for you; in them is warmth, and uses various, and of them you eat,
and there is beauty in them for you, when you bring them home to rest and when you drive them forth abroad to pasture;
and they bear your loads unto a land that you never would reach, excepting with great distress.
Surely your Lord is All-clement, All-compassionate.
And horses, and mules, and asses, for you to ride, and as an adornment; and He creates what you know not.
God's it is to show the way; and some do swerve from it.
If He willed, He would have guided you all together.
It is He who sends down to you out of heaven water of which you have to drink, and of which trees, for you to pasture your herds,
and thereby He brings forth for you crops, and olives, and palms, and vines, and all manner of fruit. Surely in that is a sign for a people who reflect.
And He subjected to you the night and day, and the sun and moon; and the stars are subjected by His command.
Surely in that are signs for a people who understand.
And that which He has multiplied for you in the earth of diverse hues.
Surely in that is a sign for a people who remember.
It is He who subjected to you the sea, that you may eat of it fresh flesh, and bring forth out of it ornaments for you to wear; and thou mayest see the ships cleaving through it; and that you may seek of His bounty, and so haply you will be thankful.
And He cast on the earth firm mountains, lest it shake with you, and rivers and ways; so haply you will be guided;
and waymarks; and by the stars they are guided.
Is He who creates as he who does not create?
Will you not remember?
If you count God's blessing, you will never number it; surely God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
And God knows what you keep secret and what you publish.
And those they call upon, apart from God, created nothing, and themselves are created,
dead, not alive; and are not aware when they shall be raised.
Your God is One God.
And they who believe not in the world to come, their hearts deny, and they have waxed proud.
Without a doubt God knows what they keep secret and what they publish; He loves not those that wax proud.
And when it is said to them, 'What has your Lord sent down?' they say, 'Fairy-tales of the ancients.'
That they may bear their loads complete on the Day of Resurrection, and some of the loads of those that they lead astray without any knowledge.
O evil the load they bear!
Those that were before them contrived; then God came upon their building from the foundations, and the roof fell down on them from over them, and the chastisement came upon them from whence they were not aware.
Then on the Day of Resurrection He will degrade them, saying, 'Where are My associates concerning which you made a breach together?'
Those that were given the knowledge will say, 'Degradation today and evil are on the unbelievers,
whom the angels take while still they are wronging themselves.' Then they will offer surrender: 'We were doing nothing evil.
'Nay; but surety God has knowledge of the things you did.
So enter the gates of Gehenna, there to dwell forever.'
Evil is the lodging of those that wax proud.
And it shall be said to the godfearing, 'What has your Lord sent down?'
They will say, 'Good! For those who do good in this world good; and surely the abode of the world to come is better; excellent is the abode of the godfearing --
Gardens of Eden they shall enter, underneath which rivers flow, wherein they shall have all they will.
So God recompenses the godfearing,
whom the angels take while they are goodly, saying, 'Peace be on you!
Enter Paradise for that you were doing.'
Do they look for aught but that the angels shall come to them, or thy Lord's command shall come?
So did those before them, and God wronged them not, but themselves they wronged.
So the evil things that they wrought. smote them, and they were encompassed by that they mocked at.
The idolators say, 'If God had willed we would not have served; apart from Him, anything, neither we nor our fathers, nor would we have forbidden, apart from Him, anything.'
So did those before them; yet is aught for the Messengers, but to deliver the manifest Message?
Indeed, We sent forth among every nation a Messenger,; saying: 'Serve you God, and eschew idols.'
Then some. of them God guided, and some were justly disposed to error.
So journey in the land, and behold how was the end of them that cried lies.
Though thou art ever so eager to guide them, God guides not those whom He leads astray; they have no helpers.
have sworn by God the most earnest oaths God will never raise up him who dies; nay, it is a promise binding upon Him, but most men know not,
so that He may make clear to them that whereon they were at variance, and that the unbelievers may know that they were truly liars.
The only words We say to a thing, when We desire it, is that We say to it 'Be,' and it is.
And those that emigrated in God's cause after they were wronged -- We shall surely lodge them in this world in a goodly lodging, and the wage of the world to come is greater, did they but know;
even such men as are patient, and put their trust in their Lord.
We sent not any before thee, except men to whom We revealed: 'Question the people of the Remembrance, if it should be that you do not know --
with the clear signs, and the Psalms; and We have sent down to thee the Remembrance that thou mayest make clear to mankind what was sent down to them; and so haply they will reflect.
Do they feel secure, those who devise evil things, that God will not cause the earth to swallow them, or that the chastisement will not come upon them, from whence they are not aware?
Or that He will not seize them in their going to and fro, and they will not be able to frustrate Him?
Or that He will not seize them, little by little destroying them?
Surely thy Lord is All-clement, All-compassionate.
Have they not regarded all things that God has created casting their shadows to the right and to the left, bowing themselves before God in all lowliness?
To God bows everything in the heavens, and every creature crawling on the earth, and the angels. They have not waxed proud;
they fear their Lord above them, and they do what they are commanded.
God says: 'Take not to you two gods.
He is only One God; so have awe of Me.'
To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and earth; His is the religion for ever.
Then will you fear other than God?
Whatsoever blessing you have, it comes from God; then when affliction visits you it is unto Him that you groan.
Then, when He removes the affliction from you, lo, a party of you assign associates to their Lord,
that they may show unthankfulness for that We have given them.
So take your joy; certainly you will soon know!
And they appoint a share of that We have provided them to what they know not.
By God, you shall be questioned as to that you forged.
And they assign to God daughters; glory be to Him! -- and they have their desire;
and when any of them is given the good tidings of a girl, his face is darkened and he chokes inwardly,
as he hides him from the people because of the evil of the good tidings that have been given unto him, whether he shall preserve it in humiliation, or trample it; into the dust.
Ah, evil is that they judge!
Those who believe not in the world to come, theirs is the evil likeness; God's is the loftiest likeness; He is the All-mighty, the All-wise.
If God should take men to task for their evildoing, He would not leave on the earth one creature that crawls; but He is deferring them to a term stated; and when their term is come they shall not put it back by a single hour nor put it forward.
They assign to God that they themselves dislike; and their tongues describe falsehood, that the reward most fair shall be theirs.
Without any doubt theirs shall be the Fire, and they are hastened in.
By God, assuredly We sent Messengers to nations before thee, but Satan decked out fair to them their deeds; he is their protector today, and there yet awaits them a painful chastisement.
And We have not sent down upon thee the Book except that thou mayest make clear to them that whereon they were at variance, and as a guidance and as a mercy to a people who believe.
And it is God who sends down out of heaven water, and therewith revives the earth after it is dead.
Surely in that is a sign for a people who have ears.
And surely in the cattle there is a lesson for you; We give you to drink of what is in their bellies, between filth and blood, pure milk, sweet to drinkers.
And of the fruits of the palms and the vines, you take therefrom an intoxicant and a provision fair.
Surely in that is a sign for a people who understand.
And thy Lord revealed unto the bees, saying: 'Take unto yourselves, of the mountains, houses, and of the trees, and of what they are building.
Then eat of all manner of fruit, and follow the ways of your Lord easy to go upon.'
Then comes there forth out of their bellies a drink of diverse hues wherein is healing for men.
Surely in that is a sign for a people who reflect.
God created you; then He will gather you to Him; and some of you will be kept back unto the vilest state of life, that after knowing somewhat, they may know nothing; God is All-knowing, All-powerful.
And God has preferred some of you over others in provision;, but those that were preferred shall not give over their provision to that their right hands possess, so that they may be equal therein.
What, and do they deny God's blessing?
God has appointed for you of yourselves wives, and He has appointed for you of your wives sons and grandsons, and He has provided you of the good things.
What, do they believe in vanity, and do they disbelieve in God's blessing?
And do they serve, apart from God, that which has no power to provide them anything from the heavens and the earth and can do nothing?
So strike not any similitudes for God; surely God knows, and you know not.
God has struck a similitude: a servant possessed by his master, having no power over anything, and one whom We have provided of Ourselves with a provision fair, and he expends of it secretly and openly.
Are they equal?
Praise belongs to God!
Nay, most of them know not.
God has struck a similitude: two men, one of them dumb, having no power over anything, and he is a burden upon his master -- wherever he despatches him, he brings no good. Is he equal to him who bids to justice, and is on a straight path?
To God belongs the Unseen in the heavens and in the earth. And the matter of the Hour is as a twinkling of the eye, or nearer.
Surely God is powerful over everything.
And it is God who brought you forth from your mothers' wombs, and He appointed for you hearing, and sight, and hearts, that haply so you will be thankful.
Have they not regarded the birds, that are subjected in the air of heaven?
Naught holds them but God; surely in that are signs for' a people who believe.
And it is God who has appointed a place of rest for you of your houses, and He has appointed for you of the skins of the cattle houses you find light on the day that you journey, and on the day you abide, and of their wool, and of their fur, and of their hair furnishing and an enjoyment for a while.
And it is God who has appointed for you coverings of the things He created, and He has appointed for you of the mountains refuges, and He has appointed for you shirts to protect you from the heat, and shirts to protect you from your own violence.
Even so He perfects His blessing upon you, that haply you will surrender.
So, if they turn their backs, thine it is only to deliver the manifest Message.
They recognize the blessing of God, then they deny it, and the most of them are the unthankful.
And the day We shall raise up from every nation a witness, then to the unbelievers no leave shall be given, nor shall they be suffered to make amends.
And when the evildoers behold the chastisement, it shall not be lightened for them, and no respite shall be given them.
And when the idolaters behold their associates, they shall say, 'Our Lord, these are our associates on whom we called apart from Thee.'
They will fling back at them the saying, 'Surely, you are truly liars.'
And they will offer God surrender that day, and there shall go astray from them that they were forging.
Those that disbelieve and bar from the way of God -- them We shall give increase of chastisement upon chastisement, for that they were doing corruption.
And the day We shall raise up from every nation a witness against them from amongst them, and We shall bring thee as a witness against those.
And We have sent down on thee the Book making clear everything, and as a guidance and a mercy, and as good tidings to those who surrender.
Surely God bids to justice and good-doing and giving to kinsmen; and He forbids indecency, dishonour, and insolence, admonishing you, so that haply you will remember.
Fulfil God's covenant, when you make covenant, and break not the oaths after they have been confirmed, and you have made God your surety; surely God knows the things you do.
And be not as a woman who breaks her thread, after it is firmly spun, into fibres, by taking your oaths as mere mutual deceit, one nation being more numerous than another nation.
God only tries you thereby; and certainly He will make clear to you upon the Day of Resurrection that whereon you were at variance.
If God had willed, He would have made you one nation; but He leads astray whom He will, and guides whom He will; and you will surely be questioned about the things you wrought.
Take not your oaths as mere mutual deceit, lest any foot should slip after it has stood firm, and you should taste evil, for that you barred from the way of God, and lest there should await you a mighty chastisement.
And do not sell the covenant of God for a small price; surely what is with God -- that is better for you, did you but know.
What is with you comes to an end, but what is with God abides; and surely We shall recompense those who were patient their wage, according to the best of what they did.
And whosoever does a righteous deed, be it male or female, believing, We shall assuredly give him to live a goodly life; and We shall recompense them their wage, according to the best of what they did.
When thou recitest the Koran, seek refuge in God from the accursed Satan;
he has no authority over those who believe and trust in their Lord;
his authority is over those who take him for their friend and ascribe associates to God.
And when We exchange a verse in the place of another verse and God knows very well what He is sending down -- they say, 'Thou art a mere forger!'
Nay, but the most of them have no knowledge.
Say: 'The Holy Spirit sent it down from thy Lord in truth, and to confirm those who believe, and to be a guidance and good tidings to those who surrender.'
And We know very well that they say, 'Only a mortal is teaching him.'
The speech of him at whom they hint is barbarous; and this is speech Arabic, manifest.
Those that believe not in the signs of God, God will not guide; there awaits them a painful chastisement.
They only forge falsehood, who believe not in the signs of God, and those -- they are the liars.
Whoso disbelieves in God, after he has believed -- excepting him who has been compelled, and his heart is still at rest in his belief -- but whosoever's breast is expanded in unbelief, upon them shall rest anger from God, and there awaits them a mighty chastisement;
that, because they have preferred the present life over the world to come, and that God guides not the people of the unbelievers.
Those -- God has set a seal on their hearts, and their hearing, and their eyes, and those -- they are the heedless ones;
without a doubt, in the world to come they will be the losers.
Then, surely thy Lord -- unto those who have emigrated after persecution, then struggled and were patient -- surely thy Lord thereafter is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
The day that every soul shall come disputing in its own behalf; and every soul shall be paid in full for what it wrought, and they shall not be wronged.
God has struck a similitude: a city that was secure, at rest, its provision coming to it easefully from every place, then it was unthankful for the blessings of God; so God let it taste the garment of hunger and of fear, for the things that they were working.
There came indeed to them a Messenger from amongst them, but they cried him lies; so they were seized by the chastisement while they were evildoers.
So eat of what God has provided you lawful and good; and be you thankful for the blessing of God, if it be Him that you serve.
These things only He has forbidden you: carrion, blood, the flesh of swine, what has been hallowed to other than God.
Yet whoso is constrained, not desiring nor transgressing, God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
And do not say, as to what your tongues falsely describe, 'This is lawful; and this is forbidden, so that you may forge against God falsehood; surely those who forge against God falsehood shall not prosper.
A little enjoyment, then for them awaits a painful chastisement.
And those of Jewry -- We have forbidden them what We related to thee before, and We wronged them not, but they wronged themselves.
Then, surely thy Lord -- unto those who did evil in ignorance, then repented after that and put things right -- surely thy Lord thereafter is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
Surely, Abraham was a nation obedient unto God, a man of pure faith and no idolater,
showing thankfulness for His blessings; He chose him, and He guided him to a straight path.
And We gave him in this world good, and in the world to come he shall be among the righteous.
Then We revealed to thee: 'Follow thou the creed of Abraham, a man of pure faith and no idolater.'
The Sabbath was only appointed for those who were at variance thereon; surely thy Lord will decide between them on the Day of Resurrection, touching their differences.
Call thou to the way of thy Lord with wisdom and good admonition, and dispute with them in the better way. Surely thy Lord knows very well those who have gone astray from His way, and He knows very well those who are guided.
And if you chastise, chastise even as you have been chastised; and yet assuredly if you are patient, better it is for those patient.
And be patient; yet is thy patience only with the help of God.
And do not sorrow for them, nor be thou straitened for what they devise.
Surely God is with those who are godfearing, and those who are good-doers.
Glory be to Him, who carried His servant by night from the Holy Mosque to the Further Mosque the precincts of which We have blessed, that We might show him some of Our signs.
He is the All-hearing, the All-seeing.
And We gave Moses the Book, and made it a guidance to the Children of Israel: 'Take not unto yourselves any guardian apart from Me.'
The seed of those We bore with Noah; he was a thankful servant.
And We decreed for the Children of Israel in the Book: 'You shall do corruption in the earth twice, and you shall ascend exceeding high.'
So, when the promise of the first of these came to pass, We sent against you servants of Ours, men of great might, and they went through the habitations, and it was a promise performed.
Then We gave back to you the turn to prevail over them, and We succoured you with wealth and children, and We made you a greater host.
'If you do good, it is your own souls you do good to, and if you do evil it is to them likewise.'
Then, when the promise of the second came to pass, We sent against you Our servants to discountenance you, and to enter the Temple, as they entered it the first time, and to destroy utterly that which they ascended to.
Perchance your Lord will have mercy upon you; but if you return, We shall return; and We have made Gehenna a prison for the unbelievers.
Surely this Koran guides to the way that is straightest and gives good tidings to the believers who do deeds of righteousness, that theirs shall be a great wage,
and that those who do not believe in the world to come -- we have prepared for them a painful chastisement.
Man prays for evil, as he prays for good; man is ever hasty.
We have appointed the night and the day as two signs; then We have blotted out the sign of the night, and made the sign of the day to see, and that you may seek bounty from your Lord, and that you may know the number of the years, and the reckoning; and everything We have distinguished very distinctly.
And every man -- We have fastened to him his bird of omen upon his neck; and We shall bring forth for him, on the Day of Resurrection, a book he shall find spread wide open.
'Read thy book!
Thy soul suffices thee this day as a reckoner against thee.'
Whosoever is guided, is only guided to his own gain, and whosoever goes astray, it is only to his own loss; no soul laden bears the load of another.
We never chastise, until We send forth a Messenger.
And when We desire to destroy a city, We command its men who live at ease, and they commit ungodliness therein, then the Word is realized against it, and We destroy it utterly.
How many generations We have destroyed after Noah!
Thy Lord suffices as one who is aware of and sees the sins of His servants.
Whosoever desires this hasty world, We hasten for him therein what We will unto whomsoever We desire; then We appoint for him Gehenna wherein he shall roast, condemned and rejected.
And whosoever desires the world to come and strives after it as he should, being a believer -- those, their striving shall be thanked.
Each We succour, these and those, from thy Lord's gift; and thy Lord's gift is not confined.
Behold, how We prefer some of them over others! And surely the world to come is greater in ranks, greater in preferment.
Set not up with God another god, or thou wilt sit condemned and forsaken.
Thy Lord has decreed you shall not serve any but Him, and to be good to parents, whether one or both of them attains old age with thee; say not to them 'Fie' neither chide them, but speak unto them words respectful,
and lower to them the wing of humbleness out of mercy and say; 'My Lord, have mercy upon them, as they raised me up when I was little.'
Your Lord knows very well what is in your hearts if you are righteous, for He is All-forgiving to those who are penitent.
And give the kinsman his right, and the needy, and the traveller; and never squander;
the squanderers are brothers of Satan, and Satan is unthankful to his Lord.
But if thou turnest from them, seeking mercy from thy Lord that thou hopest for, then speak unto them gentle words.
And keep not thy hand chained to thy neck, nor outspread it widespread altogether, or thou wilt sit reproached and denuded.
Surely thy Lord outspreads and straitens His provision unto whom He will; surely He is aware of and sees His servants.
And slay not your children for fear of poverty; We will provide for you and them; surely the slaying of them is a grievous sin.
And approach not fornication; surely it is an indecency, and evil as a way.
And slay not the soul God has forbidden, except by right.
Whosoever is slain unjustly, We have appointed to his next-of-kin authority; but let him not exceed in slaying; he shall be helped.
And do not approach the property of the orphan save in the fairest manner, until he is of age.
And fulfil the covenant; surely the covenant shall be questioned of.
And fill up the measure when you measure, and weigh with the straight balance; that is better and fairer in the issue.
And pursue not that thou hast no knowledge of; the hearing, the sight, the heart -- all of those shall be questioned of.
And walk not in the earth exultantly; certainly thou wilt never tear the earth open, nor attain the mountains in height.
All of that -- the wickedness of it is hateful in the sight of thy Lord has revealed to thee:
That is of the wisdom thy Lord set not up with God another god, or thou wilt be cast into Gehenna, reproached and rejected.
What, has your Lord favoured you with sons and taken to Himself from the angels females?
Surely it is a monstrous thing you are saying!
We have turned about in this Koran, that they may remember; and it increases them only in aversion.
Say: 'If there had been other gods with Him, as they say, in that case assuredly they would have sought a way unto the Lord of the Throne.' Glory be to Him!
High indeed be He exalted above that they say!
The seven heavens and the earth, and whosoever in them is, extol Him; nothing is, that does not proclaim His praise, but you do not understand their extolling.
Surely He is All-clement, All-forgiving.
When thou recitest the Koran, We place between thee, and those who do not believe in the world to come, a curtain obstructing,
and We lay veils upon their hearts lest they understand it, and in their ears heaviness.
And when thou mentionest thy Lord only in the Koran, they turn in their traces in aversion.
We know very well how they listen when they listen to thee, and when they conspire, when the evildoers say, 'You are only following a man bewitched!'
Behold, how they strike similitudes for thee, and go astray, and cannot find a way!
They say, 'What, when we are bones and broken bits, shall we really be raised up again in a new creation?'
Say: 'Let you be stones, or iron,
or some creation yet more monstrous in your minds!'
Then they will say, 'Who will bring us back?'
Say: 'He who originated you the first time.'
Then they will shake their heads at thee, and they will say, 'When will it be?'
Say: 'It is possible that it may be nigh,
on the day when He will call you, and you will answer praising Him, and you will think you have but tarried a little.'
And say to My servants, that they say words that are kindlier.
For surely Satan provokes strife between them, and Satan is ever a manifest foe to man.
Your Lord knows you very well; if He will, He will have mercy on you, or, if He will, He will chastise you.
We sent thee not to be a guardian over them.
And thy Lord knows very well all who are in the heavens and the earth; and We have preferred some Prophets over others; and We gave to David Psalms.
Say: 'Call on those you asserted apart from Him; they have no power to remove affliction from you, or to transfer it.
Those they call upon are themselves seeking the means to come to their Lord, which of them shall be nearer; they hope for His mercy, and fear His chastisement.
Surely thy Lord's chastisement is a thing to beware of.
No city is there, but We shall destroy it before the Day of Resurrection, or We shall chastise it with a terrible chastisement; that is in the Book inscribed.
Naught prevented Us from sending the signs but that the ancients cried lies to them; and We brought Thamood the She-camel visible, but they did her wrong.
And We do not send the signs, except to frighten.
And when We said to thee, 'Surely thy Lord encompasses men,' and We made the vision that We showed thee and the tree cursed in the Koran to be only a trial for men; and We frighten them, but it only increases them in great insolence.
And when We said to the angels, 'Bow yourselves to Adam'; so they bowed themselves, save Iblis; he said,, 'Shall I bow myself unto one Thou hast created of clay?'
He said, 'What thinkest Thou?
This whom Thou hast honoured above me -- if Thou deferrest me to the Day of Resurrection I shall assuredly master his seed, save a few.'
Said He, 'Depart!
Those of them that follow thee -- surely Gehenna shall be your recompense, an ample recompense!
And startle whomsoever of them thou canst with thy voice; and rally against them thy horsemen and thy foot, and share with them in their wealth and their children, and promise them!' But Satan promises them naught, except delusion.
'Surely over My servants thou shalt have no authority.'
Thy Lord suffices as a guardian.
Your Lord it is who drives for you the ships on the sea that you may seek His bounty; surely He is All-compassionate towards you.
And when affliction visits you upon the sea, then there go astray those on whom you call except Him; and when He delivers you to land, you turn away; man is ever unthankful.
Do you feel secure that He will not cause the shore to swallow you up, or loose against you a squall of pebbles, then you will find no guardian for you?
Or do you feel secure that He will not send you back into it a second time, and loose against you a hurricane of wind and drown you for your thanklessness, then you will find no prosecutor for you against Us?
We have honoured the Children of Adam and carried them on land and sea, and provided them with good things, and preferred them greatly over many of those We created.
On the day when We shall call all men with their record, and whoso is given his book in his right hand -- those shall read their book, and they shall not be wronged a single date-thread.
And whosoever is blind in this world shall be blind in the world to come, and he shall be even further astray from the way.
Indeed they were near to seducing thee from that We revealed to thee, that thou mightest forge against Us another, and then they would surely have taken thee as a friend;
and had We not confirmed thee, surely thou wert near to inclining unto them a very little;
then would We have let thee taste the double of life and the double of death; and then thou wouldst have found none to help thee against Us.
Indeed they were near to startling thee from the land, to expel thee from it, and then they would have tarried after thee only a little --
the wont of those We sent before thee of Our Messengers; thou wilt find no change to Our wont.
Perform the prayer at the sinking of the sun to the darkening of the night and the recital of dawn; surely the recital of dawn is witnessed.
And as for the night, keep vigil a part of it, as a work of supererogation for thee; it may be that thy Lord will raise thee up to a laudable station.
And say: 'My Lord, lead me in with a just ingoing, and lead me out with a just outgoing; grant me authority from Thee, to help me.'
And say: 'The truth has come, and falsehood has vanished away; surely falsehood is ever certain to vanish.'
And We send down, of the Koran, that which is a healing and a mercy to the believers; and the unbelievers it increases not, except in loss.
And when We bless man, he turns away, and withdraws aside; but when evil visits him, he is in despair.
Say: 'Every man works according to his own manner; but your Lord knows very well what man is best guided as to the way.'
They will question thee concerning the Spirit.
Say: 'The Spirit is of the bidding of my Lord. You have been given of knowledge nothing except a little.'
If We willed, We could take away that We have revealed to thee, then thou wouldst find none thereover to guard thee against Us,
excepting by some mercy of thy Lord; surly His favour to thee is great.
Say: 'If men and jinn banded together to produce the like of this Koran, they would never produce its like, not though they backed one another.'
We have indeed turned about for men in this Koran every manner of similitude; yet most men refuse all but unbelief.
They say, 'We will not believe thee till thou makest a spring to gush forth from the earth for us,
or till thou possessest a garden of plants and vines, and thou makest rivers to gush forth abundantly all amongst it,
or till thou makest heaven to fall, as thou assertest, on us in fragments, or thou bringest God and the angels as a surety,
or till thou possessest a house of gold ornament, or till thou goest up into heaven; and we will not believe thy going up till thou bringest down on us a book that we may read.
Say: 'Glory be to my Lord.
Am I aught but a mortal, a Messenger?'
And naught prevented men from believing when the guidance came to them, but that they said, 'Has God sent forth a mortal as Messenger?'
Say: 'Had there been in the earth angels walking. at peace, We would have sent down upon them out of heaven an angel as Messenger.'
Say: 'God suffices as a witness between me and you; surely He is aware of and sees His servants.'
Whomsoever God guides, he is rightly guided; and whom He leads astray -- thou wilt not find for them protectors, apart from Him.
And We shall muster them on the Resurrection Day upon their faces, blind, dumb, deaf; their refuge shall be Gehenna, and whensoever it abates We shall increase for them the Blaze.
That is their recompense because they disbelieved in Our signs and said, 'What, when we are bones and broken bits, shall we really be raised up again in a new creation?'
Have they not seen that God, who created the heavens and earth, is powerful to create the like of them?
He has appointed for them a term, no doubt of it; yet the unbelievers refuse all but unbelief.
Say: 'If you possessed the treasuries of my Lord's mercy, yet would you hold back for fear of expending; and man is ever niggardly.'
And We gave Moses nine signs, clear signs.
Ask the Children of Israel when he came to them, and Pharaoh said to him, 'Moses, I think thou art bewitched.'
He said, 'Indeed thou knowest that none sent these down, except the Lord of the heavens and earth, as clear proofs; and, Pharaoh, I think thou art accursed.'
He desired to startle them from the land; and We drowned him and those with him, all together.
And We said to the Children of Israel after him, 'Dwell in the land; and when the promise of the world to come comes to pass, We shall bring you a rabble.'
With the truth We have sent it down, and with the truth it has come down; and We have sent thee not, except good tidings to bear, and warning;
and a Koran We have divided, for thee to recite it to mankind at intervals, and We have sent it down successively.
Say: 'Believe in it, or believe not; those who were given the knowledge before it when it is recited to them, fall down upon their faces prostrating,
and say, "Glory be to our Lord!
Our Lord's promise is performed."
And they fall down upon their faces weeping; and it increases them in humility.'
Say: 'Call upon God, or call upon the Merciful; whichsoever you call upon, to Him belong the Names Most Beautiful.'
And be thou not loud in thy prayer, nor hushed therein, but seek thou for a way between that.
And say: 'Praise belongs to God, who has not taken to Him a son, and who has not any associate in the Kingdom, nor any protector out of humbleness.'
And magnify Him with repeated magnificats.
Praise belongs to God who has sent down upon His servant the Book and has not assigned unto it any crookedness;
right, to warn of great violence from Him, and to give good tidings unto the believers, who do righteous deeds, that theirs shall be a goodly wage
therein to abide for ever,
and to warn those who say, 'God has taken to Himself a son';
they have no knowledge of it, they nor their fathers; a monstrous word it is, issuing out of their mouths; they say nothing but a lie.
Yet perchance, if they believe not in this tiding, thou wilt consume thyself, following after them, of grief.
We have appointed all that is on the earth for an adornment for it, and that We may try which of them is fairest in works;
and We shall surely make all that is on it barren dust.
Or dost thou think the Men of the Cave and Er-Rakeem were among Our signs a wonder?
When the youths took refuge in the Cave saying, 'Our lord, give us mercy from Thee, and furnish us with rectitude in our affair.'
Then We smote their ears many years in the Cave.
Afterwards. We raised them up again, that We might know which of the two parties would better calculate the while they had tarried.
We will relate to thee their tidings truly. They were youths who believed in their Lord, and We increased them in guidance.
And We strengthened their hearts, when they stood up and said, 'Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and earth; we will not call upon any god, apart from Him, or then we had spoken outrage.
These our people have taken to them other gods, apart from Him.
Ah, if only they would bring some clear authority regarding them!
But who does greater evil than he who forges against God a lie?
So, when you have gone apart from them and that they serve, excepting God, take refuge in the Cave, and your Lord will unfold to you of His mercy, and will furnish -- you with a gentle issue of your affair.'
And thou mightest have seen the sun, when it rose, inclining from their Cave towards the right, and, when it set, passing them by on the left, while they were in a broad fissure of the Cave.
That was one of God's signs; whomsoever God guides, he is rightly guided, and whomsoever He leads astray, thou wilt not find for him a protector to direct.
Thou wouldst have thought them awake, as they lay sleeping, while We turned them now to the right, now to the left,' and their dog 'stretching its paws on the threshold.
Hadst thou observed them surely thou wouldst have turned thy back on them in flight, and been filled with terror of them.
And even so We raised them up again that they might question one another.
One of them said, 'How long have you tarried?'
They said, 'We have tarried a day, or part of a day.'
They said, 'Your Lord knows very well how long you have tarried.
Now send one of you forth with this silver to the city, and let him look for which of them has purest food, and bring you provision thereof; let him be courteous, and apprise no man of you.
If they should get knowledge of you they will stone you, or restore you to their creed, then you will not prosper ever.
And even so We made them stumble upon them, that they might know that God's promise is true, and that the Hour -- there is no doubt of it.
When they were contending among themselves of their affair then they said, 'Build over them a building; their Lord knows of them very well.'
Said those who prevailed over their affair, 'We will raise over them a place of worship.'
(They will say, 'Three; and 'their dog was the fourth of them.' They will say, 'Five; and their dog was the sixth of them, guessing at the Unseen.
They will say, 'Seven; and their dog was the eighth of them.'
Say: 'My Lord knows very well their number, and none knows them, except a few.'
So do not dispute with them, except in outward disputation, and ask not any of them for a pronouncement on them.
And do not say, regarding anything, 'I am going to do that tomorrow,'
but only, 'If God will'; and mention thy Lord, when thou forgettest, and say, 'It may be that my Lord will guide me unto something nearer to rectitude than this.')
And they tarried in the Cave three hundred years, and to that they added nine more.
Say: 'God knows very well how long they tarried.
To Him belongs the Unseen in the heavens and in the earth.
How well He sees!
How well He hears!
They have no protector, apart from Him, and He associates in His government no one.'
Recite what has been revealed to thee of the Book of thy Lord; no man can change His words. Apart from Him, thou wilt find no refuge.
And restrain thyself with those who call upon their Lord at morning and evening, desiring His countenance, and let not thine eyes turn away from them, desiring the adornment of the present life; and obey not him whose heart We have made neglectful of Our remembrance so that he follows his own lust, and his affair has become all excess.
Say: 'The truth is from your Lord; so let whosoever will believe, and let whosoever will disbelieve.'
Surely We have prepared for the evildoers a fire, whose pavilion encompasses them; if they call for succour, they will be succoured with water like molten copper, that shall scald their faces -- how evil a potion, and how evil a resting-place!
Surely those who believe, and do deeds of righteousness -- surely We leave not to waste the wage of him who does good works;
those -- theirs shall be Gardens of Eden, underneath which rivers flow; therein they shall be adorned with bracelets of gold, and they shall be robed in green garments of silk and brocade, therein reclining upon couches -- O, how excellent a reward!
And O, how fair a resting-place!
And strike for them a similitude: two men. To one of them We assigned two gardens of vines, and surrounded them with palm-trees, and between them We set a sown field;
each of the two gardens yielded its produce and failed naught in any wise; and We caused to gush amidst them a river.
So he had fruit; and he said to his fellow, as he was conversing with him, 'I have more abundance of wealth than thou and am mightier in respect of men.
And he entered his garden, wronging himself; he said, 'I do not think that this will ever perish;
I do not think that the Hour is coming; and if I am indeed returned to my Lord, I shall surely find a better resort than this.'
Said his fellow, as he was conversing with him, 'What, disbelievest thou in Him who created thee of dust, then of a sperm-drop, then shaped thee as a man?
But lo, He is God, my Lord, and I will not associate with my Lord any one.
Why, when thou wentest into thy garden, didst thou not say, "As God will; there is no power except in God"? If thou seest me, that I am less than thou in wealth and children,
yet it may be that my Lord will give me better than thy garden, and loose on it a thunderbolt out of heaven, so that in the morning it will be a slope of dust,
or in the morning the water of it will be sunk into the earth, so that thou wilt not be able to seek it out.'
And his fruit was all encompassed, and in the morning he was wringing his hands for that he had expended upon it, and it was fallen down upon its trellises, and he was saying, 'Would I had not associated with my Lord any one!'
But there was no host to help him, apart from God, and he was helpless.
Thereover protection belongs only to God the True; He is best rewarding, best in the issue.
And strike for them the similitude of the present life: it is as water that We send down out of heaven, and the plants of the earth mingle with it; and in the morning it is straw the winds scatter; and God is omnipotent over everything.
Wealth and sons are the adornment of the present world; but the abiding things, the deeds of righteousness, are better with God in reward, and better in hope.
And on the day We shall set the mountains in motion, and thou seest the earth coming forth, and We muster them so that We leave not so much as one of them behind;
and they shall be presented before their Lord in ranks -- 'You have come to Us, as We created you upon the first time; nay, you asserted We should not appoint for you a tryst.'
And the Book shall be set in place; and thou wilt see the sinners fearful at what is in it, and saying, 'Alas for us!
How is it with this Book, that it leaves nothing behind, small or great, but it has numbered it?'
And they shall find all they wrought present, and thy Lord shall not wrong anyone.
And when We said to the angels, 'Bow yourselves to Adam'; so they bowed themselves, save Iblis; he was one of the jinn, and committed ungodliness against his Lord's command.
What, and do you take him and his seed to be your friends, apart from Me, and they an enemy to you?
How evil is that exchange for the evildoers!
I made them not witnesses of the creation of the heavens and earth, neither of the creation of themselves; I would not ever take those who lead others astray to be My supporters.
And on the day He shall say, 'Call on My associates whom you asserted'; and then they shall call on them, but they will not answer them, and We shall set a gulf between them.
Then the evildoers will see the Fire, and think that they are about to fall into it, and will find no escape from it.
We have indeed turned about for men in this Koran every manner of similitude; man is the most disputatious of things.
And naught prevented men from believing when the guidance came unto them, and seeking their Lord's forgiveness, but that the wont of the ancients should come upon them, or that the chastisement should come upon them face to face.
And We send not the Envoys, but good tidings to bear, and warning.
Yet do the unbelievers dispute with falsehood, that they may rebut thereby the truth.
They have taken My signs, and what they are warned of, in mockery.
And who does greater evil than he who, being reminded of the signs of his Lord, turns away from them and forgets what his hands have forwarded?
Surely We have laid veils on their hearts lest they understand it, and in their ears heaviness; and though thou callest them to the guidance, yet they will not be guided ever.
But thy Lord is the All-forgiving, full of mercy.
If He should take them to task for that they have earned, He would hasten for them the chastisement; but they have a tryst, from which they will find no escape.
And those cities, We destroyed them when they did evil, and appointed for their destruction a tryst.
And when Moses said to his page, 'I will not give up until I reach the meeting of the two seas, though I go on for many years.
Then, when they reached their meeting, they forgot their fish, and it took its way into the sea, burrowing.
When they had passed over, he said to his page, 'Bring us our breakfast; indeed, we have encountered weariness from this our journey.'
He said, 'What thinkest thou? When we took refuge in the rock, then I forgot the fish-and it was Satan himself that made me forget it so that I should not remember it -- and so it took its way into the sea in a manner marvellous.'
Said he, 'This is what we were seeking!'
And so they returned upon their tracks, retracing them.
Then they found one of Our servants unto whom We had given mercy from Us, and We had taught him knowledge proceeding from Us.
Moses said to him, 'Shall I follow thee so that thou teachest me, of what thou hast been taught, right judgment.'
Said he, 'Assuredly thou wilt not be able to bear with me patiently.
And how shouldst thou bear patiently that thou hast never encompassed in thy knowledge?'
He said, 'Yet thou shalt find me, if God will, patient; and I shall not rebel against thee in anything.'
Said he, 'Then if thou followest me, question me not on anything until I myself introduce the mention of it to thee.'
So they departed; until, when they embarked upon the ship, he made a hole in it.
He said, 'What, hast thou made a hole in it so as to drown its passengers?
Thou hast indeed done a grievous thing.'
Said he, 'Did I not say that thou couldst never bear with me patiently?'
He said, 'Do not take me to task that I forgot, neither constrain me to do a thing too difficult.'
So they departed; until, when they met a lad, he slew him.
He said, 'What, hast thou slain a soul innocent, and that not to retaliate for a soul slain?
Thou hast indeed done a horrible thing.'
Said he, 'Did I not say that thou couldst never bear with me patiently?'
He said, 'If I question thee on anything after this, then keep me company no more; thou hast already experienced excuse sufficient on my part.'
So they departed; until, when they reached the people of a city, they asked the people for food, but they refused to receive them hospitably.
There they found a wall about to tumble down, and so he set it up.
He said, 'If thou hadst wished, thou couldst have taken a wage for that.'
Said he, 'This is the parting between me and thee.
Now I will tell thee the interpretation of that thou couldst not bear patiently.
As for the ship, it belonged to certain poor men, who toiled upon the sea; and I desired to damage it, for behind them there was a king who was seizing every ship by brutal force.
As for the lad, his parents were believers; and we were afraid he would impose on them insolence and unbelief;
so we desired that their Lord should give to them in exchange one better than he in purity, and nearer in tenderness.
As for the wall, it belonged to two orphan lads in the city, and under it was a treasure belonging to them. Their father was a righteous man; and thy Lord desired that they should come of age and then bring forth their treasure as a mercy from thy Lord.
I did it not of my own bidding. This is the interpretation of that thou couldst not bear patiently.'
They will question thee concerning Dhool Karnain.
Say: 'I will recite to you a mention of him.
We established him in the land, and We gave him a way to everything;
and he followed a way
until, when he reached the setting of the sun, he found it setting in a muddy spring, and he found nearby a people.
We said, 'O Dhool Karnain, either thou shalt chastise them, or thou shalt take towards them a way of kindness.'
He said, 'As for the evildoer, him we shall chastise, then he shall be returned to his Lord and He shall chastise him with a horrible chastisement.
But as for him who believes, and does righteousness, he shall receive as recompense the reward most fair, and we shall speak to him, of our command, easiness.'
Then he followed a way
until, when he reached the rising of the sun, he found it rising upon a people for whom We had not appointed any veil to shade them from it.
So; and We encompassed in knowledge what was with him.
Then he followed a way
until, when he reached between the two barriers, he found this side of them a people scarcely able to understand speech.
They said, 'O Dhool Karnain, behold, Gog and Magog are doing corruption in the earth; so shall we assign to thee a tribute, against thy setting up a barrier between us and between them?'
He said, 'That wherein my Lord has established me is better; so aid me forcefully, and I will set up a rampart between you and between them.
Bring me ingots of iron!'
Until, when he had made all level between the two cliffs, he said, 'Blow!'
Until, when he had made it a fire, he said, 'Bring me, that I may pour molten brass on it.'
So they were unable either to scale it or pierce it.
He said, 'This is a mercy from my Lord. But when the promise of my Lord comes to pass, He will make it into powder; and my Lord's promise is ever true.'
Upon that day We shall leave them surging on one another, and the Trumpet shall he blown, and We shall gather them together,
and upon that day We shall present Gehenna to the unbelievers
whose eyes were covered against My remembrance, and they were not able to hear.
What, do the unbelievers reckon that they may take My servants as friends, apart from Me?
We have prepared Gehenna for the unbelievers' hospitality.
Say: 'Shall We tell you who will be the greatest losers in their works?
Those whose striving goes astray in the present life, while they think that they are working good deeds.
Those are they that disbelieve in the signs of their Lord and the encounter with Him; their works have failed, and on the Day of Resurrection We shall not assign to them any weight.
That is their recompense -- Gehenna for that they were unbelievers and took My signs and My messengers in mockery.
But those who believe, and do deeds of righteousness -- the Gardens. of Paradise shall be their hospitality,
therein to dwell forever, desiring no removal out of them.'
Say:. 'If the sea were ink for the Words of my Lord, the sea would be spent before the Words of my Lord are spent, though We brought replenishment the like of it.'
Say: 'I am only a mortal the like of you; it is revealed to me that your God is One God.
So let him, who hopes for the encounter with his Lord, work righteousness, and not associate with his Lord's service anyone.
Kaf Ha Ya Ain Sad
The mention of thy Lord's mercy unto His servant Zachariah;
when he called upon his Lord secretly
saying, 'O my Lord, behold the bones within me are feeble and my head is all aflame with hoariness. And in calling on Thee, my Lord, I have never been hitherto unprosperous.
And now I fear my kinsfolk after I am gone; and my wife is barren.
So give me, from Thee, a kinsman
who shall be my inheritor and the inheritor of the House of Jacob; and make him, my Lord, well-pleasing.'
'O Zachariah, We give thee good tidings of a boy, whose name is John.
No namesake have We given him aforetime.'
He said, 'O my Lord, how shall I have a son, seeing my wife is barren, and I have attained to the declining of old age?'
Said He, 'So it shall be; thy Lord says, "Easy is that for Me, seeing that I created thee aforetime, when thou wast nothing."'
He said, 'Lord, appoint to me some sign.'
Said He, 'Thy sign is that thou shall not speak to men, though being without fault, three nights.'
So he came forth unto his people from the Sanctuary, then he made signal to them, 'Give you glory at dawn and evening.'
'O John, take the Book forcefully'; and We gave him judgment, yet a little child,
and a tenderness from Us, and purity; and he was godfearing,
and cherishing his parents, not arrogant, rebellious.
'Peace be upon him, the day he was born, and the day he dies, and the day he is raised up alive!'
And mention in the Book Mary when she withdrew from her people to an eastern place,
and she took a veil apart from them; then We sent unto her Our Spirit that presented himself to her a man without fault.
She said, 'I take refuge in the All-merciful from thee!
If thou fearest God...
He said, 'I am but a messenger come from thy Lord, to give thee a boy most pure.
She said, 'How shall I have a son whom no mortal has touched, neither have I been unchaste?'
He said, 'Even so thy Lord has said: "Easy is that for Me; and that We may appoint him a sign unto men and a mercy from Us; it is a thing decreed."'
So she conceived him, and withdrew with him to a distant place.
And the birthpangs surprised her by the trunk of the palm-tree.
She said, 'Would I had died ere this, and become a thing forgotten!'
But the one that was below her called to her, 'Nay, do not sorrow; see, thy Lord has set below thee a rivulet.
Shake also to thee the palm-trunk, and there shall come tumbling upon thee dates fresh and ripe.
Eat therefore, and drink, and be comforted; and if thou shouldst see any mortal, say, "I have vowed to the All-merciful a fast, and today I will not speak to any man.
Then she brought the child to her folk carrying him; and they said, 'Mary, thou hast surely committed a monstrous thing!
Sister of Aaron, thy father was not a wicked man, nor was thy mother a woman unchaste.'
Mary pointed to the child then; but they said, 'How shall we speak to one who is still in the cradle, a little child?'
He said, 'Lo, I am God's servant; God has given me the Book, and made me a Prophet.
Blessed He has made me, wherever I may be; and He has enjoined me to pray, and to give the alms, so long as I live,
and likewise to cherish my mother; He has not made me arrogant, unprosperous.
Peace be upon me, the day I was born, and the day I die, and the day I am raised up alive!'
That is Jesus, son of Mary, in word of truth, concerning which they are doubting.
It is not for God to take a son unto Him.
Glory be to Him!
When He decrees a thing, He but says to it 'Be,' and it is.
Surely God is my Lord, and your Lord; So serve you Him.
This is a straight path.
But the parties have fallen into variance among themselves; then woe to those who disbelieve for the scene of a dreadful day.
How well they will hear and see on the day they come to Us!
But the evildoers even today are in error manifest.
Warn thou them of the day of anguish, when the matter shall be determined, and they yet heedless and unbelieving.
Surely We shall inherit the earth and all that are upon it, and unto Us they shall be returned.
And mention in the Book Abraham; surely he was a true man, a Prophet.
When he said to his father, 'Father, why worshippest thou that which neither hears nor sees, nor avails thee anything?
Father, there has come to me knowledge such as came not to thee; so follow me, and I will guide thee on a level path.
Father, serve not Satan; surely Satan is a rebel against the All-merciful.
Father, I fear that some chastisement from the All-merciful will smite thee, so that thou becomest a friend to Satan.
Said he, 'What, art thou shrinking from my gods, Abraham?
Surely, if thou givest not over, I shall stone thee; so forsake me now for some while.'
He said, 'Peace be upon thee!
I will ask my Lord to forgive thee; surely He is ever gracious to me.
Now I will go apart from you and that you call upon, apart from God; I will call upon my Lord, and haply I shall not be, in calling upon my Lord, unprosperous.
So, when he went apart from them and that they were serving, apart from God, We gave him Isaac and Jacob, and each We made a Prophet;
and We gave them of Our mercy, and We appointed unto them a tongue of truthfulness, sublime.
And mention in the Book Moses; he was devoted, and he was a Messenger, a Prophet.
We called to him from the right side Of the Mount, and We brought him near in communion.
And We gave him his brother Aaron, of Our mercy, a Prophet.
And mention in the Book Ishmael; he was true to his promise, and he was a Messenger, a Prophet.
He bade his people to pray and to give the alms, and he was pleasing to his Lord.
And mention in the Book Idris; he was a true man, a Prophet.
We raised him up to a high place.
These are they whom God has blessed among the Prophets of the seed of Adam, and of those We bore with Noah, and of the seed of Abraham and Israel, and of those We guided and chose.
When the signs of the All-merciful were recited to them, they fell down prostrate, weeping.
Then there succeeded after them a succession who wasted the prayer, and followed lusts; so they shall encounter error
save him who repents, and believes, and does a righteous deed; those -- they shall enter Paradise, and they shall not be wronged anything;
Gardens of Eden that the All-merciful promised His servants in the Unseen; His promise is ever performed.
There they shall hear no idle talk, but only 'Peace.' There they shall have their provision at dawn and evening.
That is Paradise which We shall give as an inheritance to those of Our servants who are godfearing.
We come not down, save at the commandment of thy Lord.
To Him belongs all that is before us, and all that is behind us, and all between that.
And thy Lord is never forgetful, Lord He of the heavens and earth and all that is between them.
So serve Him, and be thou patient in His service; knowest thou any that can be named with His Name?
Man says, 'What, when I am dead shall I then be brought forth alive?'
Will not man remember that We created him aforetime, when he was nothing?
Now, by thy Lord, We shall surely muster them, and the Satans, then We shall parade them about Gehenna hobbling on their knees.
Then We shall pluck forth from every party whichever of them was the most hardened in disdain of the All-merciful;
then We shall know very well those most deserving to burn there.
Not one of you there is, but he shall go down to it; that for thy Lord is a thing decreed, determined.
Then We shall deliver those that were godfearing; and the evildoers We shall leave there, hobbling on their knees.
When Our signs are recited to them as clear signs, the unbelievers say to the believers, 'Which of the two parties is better in station, fairer in assembly?'
And how many a generation We destroyed before them, who were fairer in furnishing and outward show!
Say: 'Whosoever is in error, let the All-merciful prolong his term for him! Till, when they see that they were threatened, whether the chastisement, or the Hour, then they shall surely know who is worse in place, and who is weaker in hosts.'
And God shall increase those who were guided in guidance; and the abiding things, the deeds of righteousness, are better with thy Lord in reward, and better in return
Hast thou seen him who disbelieves in Our signs and says, 'Assuredly I shall be given wealth and children'?
What, has he observed the Unseen, or taken a covenant with the All-merciful?
No, indeed! We shall assuredly write down all that he says, and We shall prolong for him the chastisement;
and We shall inherit from him that he says, and he shall come to Us alone.
And they have taken to them other gods apart from God, that they might be for them a might.
No, indeed! They shall deny their service, and they shall be against them pitted.
Hast thou not seen how We sent the Satans against the unbelievers, to prick them?
So hasten thou not against them; We are only numbering for them a number.
On the day that We shall muster the godfearing to the All-merciful with pomp
and drive the evildoers into Gehenna herding,
having no power of intercession, save those who have taken with the All-merciful covenant.
And they say, 'The All-merciful has taken unto Himself a son.
You have indeed advanced something hideous!
The heavens are wellnigh rent of it and the earth split asunder, and the mountains wellnigh fall down crashing for
that they have attributed to the All-merciful a son;
and it behoves not the All-merciful to take a son.
None is there in the heavens and earth but he comes to the All-merciful as a servant;
He has indeed counted them, and He has numbered them exactly.
Every one of them shall come to Him upon the Day of Resurrection, all alone.
Surely those who believe and do deeds of righteousness -- unto them the All-merciful shall assign love.
Now We have made it easy by thy tongue that thou mayest bear good tidings thereby to the godfearing, and warn a people stubborn.
And how many a generation We destroyed before them!
Dost thou perceive so much as one of them, or hear of them a whisper?
Ta Ha
We have not sent down the Koran upon thee for thee to be unprosperous,
but only as a reminder to him who tears,
a revelation from Him who created the earth and the high heavens;
the All-compassionate sat Himself upon the Throne; to Him belongs
all that is in the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, and all that is underneath the soil.
Be thou loud in thy speech, yet surely He knows the secret and that yet more hidden.
God -- there is no god but He.
To Him belong the Names Most Beautiful.
Hast thou received the story of Moses?
When he saw a fire, and said to his family, 'Tarry you here; I observe a fire. Perhaps I shall bring you a brand from it, or I shall find at the fire guidance.'
When he came to it, a voice cried, 'Moses,
I am thy Lord; put off thy shoes; thou art in the holy valley, Towa.
I Myself have chosen thee; therefore give thou ear to this revelation.
Verily I am God; there is no god but I; therefore serve Me, and perform the prayer of My remembrance.
The Hour is coming; I would conceal it that every soul may be recompensed for its labours.
Let none bar thee from it, that believes not in it but follows after his own caprice, or thou wilt perish.
What is that, Moses, thou hast in thy right hand?'
'Why, it is my staff,' said Moses. 'I lean upon it, and with it I beat down leaves to feed my sheep; other uses also I find in it.
Said He, 'Cast it down, Moses!'
and he cast it down, and behold it was a serpent sliding.
Said He, 'Take it, and fear not; We will restore it to its first state.
Now clasp thy hand to thy arm-pit; it shall come forth white, without evil. That is a second sign.
So We would show thee some of Our greatest signs.
Go to Pharaoh; he has waxed insolent.'
'Lord, open my breast,' said Moses,
'and do Thou ease for me my task.
Unloose the knot upon my tongue, t
hat they may understand my words.
Appoint for me of my folk a familiar,
Aaron, my brother;
by him confirm my strength,
and associate him with me in my task.
So shall we glorify Thee,
and remember Thee abundantly.
Surely Thou seest into us.'
Said He, 'Thou art granted, Moses, thy petition.
Already another time We favoured thee,
when We revealed what was revealed unto thy mother:
"Cast him into the ark, and cast him into the river, and let the river throw him up on the shore. An enemy of Mine and his shall take him."
And I loaded on thee love from Me, and to be formed in My sight,
when thy sister went out, saying, "Shall I point you to one to have charge of him?"
So We returned thee to thy mother that she might rejoice, and not sorrow.
Then thou slewest; a living soul, and We delivered thee out of grief, and We tried thee with many trials.
Many years among the people of Midian thou didst sojourn, then camest hither, Moses, according to a decree.
I have chosen thee for My service;
go therefore, thou and thy brother; with My signs, and neglect not to remember Me.
Go to Pharaoh, for he has waxed insolent;
yet speak gently to him, that haply he may be mindful, or perchance fear.'
'O our Lord,' said Moses and Aaron, 'truly we fear he may exceed against us, or wax insolent.'
'Fear not,' said He. 'Surely I shall be with you, hearing and seeing.
So go you both to Pharaoh, and say, "We are the Messengers of thy Lord, so send forth with us the Children of Israel and chastise them not; we have brought thee a sign from thy Lord; and peace be upon him who follows the guidance!
It has been revealed to us that chastisement shall light upon him who cries lies and turns his back."
Pharaoh said, 'Who is your Lord, Moses?'
He said, 'Our Lord is He who gave everything its creation, then guided it.'
Pharaoh said, 'And what of the former generations?'
Said Moses, 'The knowledge of them is with my Lord, in a Book; my Lord goes not astray, nor forgets --
He who appointed the earth to be a cradle for you, and therein threaded roads for you, and sent down water out of heaven, and therewith We have brought forth divers kinds of plants.
Do you eat, and pasture your cattle!
Surely in that are signs for men possessing reason.
Out of the earth We created you, and We shall restore you into it, and bring you forth from it a second time.'
So We showed Pharaoh all Our signs, but he cried lies, and refused.
'Hast thou come, Moses,' he said, 'to expel us out of our land
by thy sorcery? We shall assuredly bring thee sorcery the like of it; therefore appoint a tryst between us and thee, a place mutually agreeable, and we shall not fail it, neither thou.'
'Your tryst shall be upon the Feast Day.' said Moses. 'Let the people be mustered at the high noon.'
Pharaoh then withdrew, and gathered his guile. Thereafter he came again,
and Moses said to them, 'O beware! Forge not a lie against God, lest He destroy you with a chastisement.
Whoso forges has ever failed.'
And they disputed upon their plan between them, and communed secretly
saying, 'These two men are sorcerers and their purpose is to expel you out of your land by their sorcery, and to extirpate your justest way.
So gather your guile; then come in battle-line.
Whoever today gains the upper hand shall surely prosper.
They said, 'Moses, either thou wilt cast, or we shall be the first to cast.'
'No,' said Moses. 'Do you cast!'
And lo, it seemed to him, by their sorcery, their ropes and their staffs were sliding;
and Moses conceived a fear within him.
We said unto him, 'Fear not; surely thou art the uppermost.
Cast down what is in thy right hand, and it shall swallow what they have fashioned; for they have fashioned only the guile of a sorcerer, and the sorcerer prospers not; wherever he goes.'
And the sorcerers cast themselves down prostrating.
'We believe,' they said, 'in the Lord of Aaron and Moses.'
Pharaoh said, 'Have you believed him before I gave you leave?
Why, he is the chief of you, the same that taught you sorcery; I shall assuredly cut off alternately your hands and feet, then I shall crucify you upon the trunks of palm-trees; you shall know of a certainty which of us is more terrible in chastisement, and more abiding.'
They said, 'We will not prefer thee over the clear signs that have come to us, nor over Him who originated us.
Decide then what thou wilt decide; thou canst only decide touching this present life.
We believe in our Lord, that He may pardon us our offences, and the sorcery thou hast constrained us to practise; God is better, and more abiding.'
Whosoever comes unto his Lord a sinner, for him awaits Gehenna wherein he shall neither die nor live.
And whoso comes unto Him a believer having done deeds of righteousness, those -- for them await the most sublime degrees;
Gardens of Eden, underneath which rivers flow, therein dwelling forever; that is the recompense of the self-purified.
Also We revealed unto Moses, 'Go with My servants by night; strike for them a dry path in the sea, fearing not overtaking, neither afraid.'
Pharaoh followed them with his hosts, but they were overwhelmed by the sea;
so Pharaoh had led his people astray, and was no guide to them.
Children of Israel, We delivered you from your enemy; and We made covenant with you upon the right side of the Mount, and sent down on you manna and quails:
'Eat of the good things wherewith We have provided you; but exceed not therein, or My anger shall alight on you; and on whomsoever My anger alights, that man is hurled to ruin.
Yet I am All-forgiving to him who repents and believes, and does righteousness, and at last is guided.'
'What has sped thee far from thy people, Moses?'
'They are upon my tracks,' Moses said. 'I have hastened, Lord, only that I may please Thee.'
Said He, 'We have tempted thy people since thou didst leave them. The Samaritan has misled them into error.'
Then Moses returned very angry and sorrowful to his people, saying, 'My people, did your Lord not promise a fair promise to you?
Did the time of the covenant seem so long to you, or did you desire that anger should alight on you from your Lord, so that you failed in your tryst with me?'
'We have not failed in our tryst with thee,' they said, 'of our volition; but we were loaded with fardels, even the ornaments of the people, and we cast them, as the Samaritan also threw them, into the fire.'
(Then he brought out for them a Calf, a mere body that lowed; and they said, 'This is your god, and the god of Moses, whom he has forgotten.'
What? Did they not see that thing returned no speech unto them, neither had any power to hurt or profit them?
Yet Aaron had aforetime said to them, 'My people, you have been tempted by this thing, no more; surety your Lord is the All-merciful; therefore follow me, and obey my commandment!'
'We will not cease,' they said, 'to cleave to it, until Moses returns to us.')
Moses said, 'What prevented thee, Aaron, when thou sawest them in error,
so that thou didst not follow after me?
Didst thou then disobey my commandment?'
'Son of my mother,' Aaron said, 'take me not by the beard, or the head!
I was fearful that thou wouldst say, "Thou hast divided the Children of Israel, and thou hast not observed my word."
Moses said, 'And thou, Samaritan, what was thy business?'
'I beheld what they beheld not,' he said, 'and I seized a handful of dust from the messenger's track, and cast it into the thing.
So my soul prompted me.'
'Depart!' said Moses.
'It shall be thine all this life to cry "Untouchable!" And thereafter a tryst awaits thee thou canst not fail to keep Behold thy god, to whom all the day thou wast cleaving!
We will surely burn it and scatter its ashes into the sea.
Your God is only the One God; there is no god, but He alone who in His knowledge embraces everything.'
So We relate to thee stories of what has gone before, and We have given thee a remembrance from Us.
Whosoever turns away from it, upon the Day of Resurrection He shall bear a fardel,
therein abiding forever; how evil upon the Day of Resurrection that burden for them!
On the day the Trumpet is blown; and We shall muster the sinners upon that day with eyes staring,
whispering one to another, 'You have tarried only ten nights.'
We know very well what they will say, when the justest of them in the way will say, 'You have tarried only a day.'
They will question thee concerning the mountains.
Say: 'My Lord will scatter them as ashes;
then He will leave them a level hollow
wherein thou wilt see no crookedness neither any curving.'
On that day they will follow the Summoner in whom is no crookedness; voices will be hushed to the All-merciful, so that thou hearest naught but a murmuring.
Upon that day the intercession will not profit, save for him to whom the All-merciful gives leave, and whose speech He approves.
He knows what is before them and behind them, and they comprehend Him not in knowledge.
And faces shall be humbled unto the Living, the Eternal.
He will have failed whose burden is of evildoing;
but whosoever does deeds of righteousness, being a believer, shall fear neither wrong nor injustice.
Even so We have sent it down as an Arabic Koran, and We have turned about in it something of threats, that haply they may be godfearing, or it may arouse in them remembrance.
So high exalted be God, the true King!
And hasten not with the Koran ere its revelation is accomplished unto thee; and say, 'O my Lord, increase me in knowledge.'
And We made covenant with Adam before, but he forgot, and We found in him no constancy.
And when We said to the angels, 'Bow yourselves to Adam'; so they bowed themselves, save Iblis; he refused.
Then We said, 'Adam, surely this is an enemy to thee and thy wife. So let him not expel you both from the Garden, so that thou art unprosperous.
It is assuredly given to thee neither to hunger therein, nor to go naked,
neither to thirst therein, nor to suffer the sun.'
Then Satan whispered to him saying, 'Adam, shall I point thee to the Tree of Eternity, and a Kingdom that decays not?'
So the two of them ate of it, and their shameful parts revealed to them, and they took to stitching upon themselves leaves of the Garden.
And Adam disobeyed his Lord, and so he erred.
Thereafter his Lord chose him, and turned again unto him, and He guided him.
Said He, 'Get you down, both of you together, out of it, each of you an enemy to each; but if there comes to you from Me guidance, then whosoever follows My guidance shall not go astray, neither shall he be unprosperous;
but whosoever turns away from My remembrance, his shall be a life of narrowness, and on the Resurrection Day We shall raise him blind.'
He shall say, 'O my Lord, why hast thou raised me blind, and I was wont to see?'
God shall say, 'Even so it is. Our signs came unto thee, and thou didst forget them; and so today thou art forgotten.'
So We recompense him who is prodigal and believes not in the signs of his Lord; and the chastisement of the world to come is more terrible and more enduring.
Is it not a guidance to them, how many generations We destroyed before them in whose dwelling-places they walk?
Surely in that are signs for men possessing reason.
And but for a word that preceded from thy Lord, and a stated term, it had been fastened.
So be thou patient under what they say, and proclaim thy Lord's praise before the rising of the sun, and before its setting, and proclaim thy Lord's praise in the watches of the night, and at the ends of the day; haply thou wilt be well-pleasing.
Stretch not thine eyes to that We have given pairs of them to enjoy - the flower of the present life, that We may try them therein and thy Lord's provision is better, and more enduring.
And bid thy family to pray, and be thou patient in it; We ask of thee no provision, but it is We who provide thee and the issue ultimate is to godfearing.
They say, 'Why does he not bring us a sign from his Lord?'
Has there not come to them the clear sign of what is in the former scrolls?
Had We destroyed them with a chastisement aforetime, they would have said, 'Our Lord, why didst Thou not send us a Messenger, so that we might have followed Thy signs before that we were humiliated and degraded?'
Say: 'Everyone is waiting; so wait, and assuredly you shall know who are the travellers on the even path, and who is guided.'
Nigh unto men has drawn their reckoning, while they in heedlessness are yet turning away;
no Remembrance from their Lord comes to them lately renewed, but they listen to it yet playing,
diverted their hearts.
The evildoers whisper one to another, 'Is this aught but a mortal like to yourselves?
What, will you take to sorcery with your eyes open?'
He says: 'My Lord knows what is said in the heavens and the earth, and He is the All-hearing, the All-knowing.'
Nay, but they say: 'A hotchpotch of nightmares! Nay, he has forged it; nay, he is a poet!
Now therefore let him bring us a sign, even as the ancient ones were sent as Messengers.'
Not one city that We destroyed before them believed; what then, will they not believe?
And We sent none before thee, but men to whom We made revelation -- question the People of the Remembrance, if you do not know --
nor did We fashion them as bodies that ate not food, neither were they immortal;
then We made true the promise We gave them and We delivered them, and whomsoever We would; and We destroyed the prodigal.
Now We have sent down to you a Book wherein is your Remembrance; will you not understand?
How many a city that was evildoing We have shattered, and set up after it another people!
Then, when they perceived Our might, behold, they ran headlong out of it.
'Run not! Return you unto the luxury that you exulted in, and your dwelling-places; haply you shall be questioned.'
They said, 'Alas for us! We have been evildoers.'
So they ceased not to cry, until We made them stubble, silent and still.
We created not the heaven and the earth, and whatsoever between them is, as playing;
had We desired to take to Us a diversion We would have taken it to Us from Ourselves, had We done aught.
Nay, but We hurl the truth against falsehood and it prevails over it, and behold, falsehood vanishes away.
Then woe to you for that you describe!
To Him belongs whosoever is in the heavens and the earth; and those who are with Him wax not too proud to do Him service neither grow weary,
glorifying Him by night and in the daytime and never failing.
Or have they taken gods out of the earth who raise the dead?
Why, were there gods in earth and heaven other than God, they would surely go to ruin; so glory be to God, the Lord of the Throne, above that they describe!
He shall not be questioned as to what He does, but they shall he questioned.
Or have they taken gods apart from Him?
Say: 'Bring your proof!
This is the Remembrance of him who is with me, and the Remembrance of those before me.
Nay, but the most part of them know not the truth, so therefore they are turning away.
And We sent never a Messenger before thee except that We revealed to him, saying, 'There is no god but I; so serve Me.'
They say:' 'The All-merciful has taken to Him a son.'
Glory be to Him!
Nay, but they are honoured servants
that outstrip Him not in speech, and perform as He commands.
He knows what is before them and behind them, and they intercede not save for him with whom He is well-pleased, and they tremble in awe of Him.
If any of them says, 'I am a god apart from Him', such a one We recompense with Gehenna; even so We recompense the evildoers.
Have not the unbelievers then beheld that the heavens and the earth were a mass all sewn up, and then We unstitched them and of water fashioned every living thing?
Will they not believe?
And We set in the earth firm mountains lest it should shake with them, and We set in it ravines to serve as ways, that haply so they may be guided;
and We set up the heaven as a roof well-protected; yet still from Our signs they are turning away.
It is He who created the night and the day, the sun and the moon, each swimming in a sky.
We have not assigned to any mortal before thee to live forever; therefore, if thou diest, will they live forever?
Every soul shall taste of death; and We try you with evil and good for a testing, then unto Us you shall be returned.
When the unbelievers behold thee, they take thee only for mockery: 'Ha, is this the one who makes mention of your gods?' Yet they in the Remembrance of the All-merciful are unbelievers.
Man was created of haste.
Assuredly I shall show you My signs; so demand not that I make haste.
They say, 'And when shall the promise come to pass, if you speak truly?'
If the unbelievers but knew when that they shall not ward off the Fire from their faces nor from their backs, neither shall they be helped!
Nay, but it shall come upon them suddenly, dumbfounding them, and they shall not be able to repel it, nor shall they be respited.
Messengers indeed were mocked at before thee, but those that scoffed at them were encompassed by that they mocked at.
Say: 'Who shall guard you by night and in the daytime from the All-merciful?'
Nay, but from the Remembrance of their Lord they are turning away.
Or have they gods that shall defend them apart from Us?
Why, they are not able to help themselves, nor shall they be guarded in safety from Us.
Nay, but Ourselves gave these and their fathers enjoyment of days, until their life had lasted long while upon them.
What, do they not see how We come to the land, diminishing it in its extremities?
Or are they the victors?
Say: 'I warn you only by the Revelation'; but they that are deaf do not hear the call when they are warned.
If but a breath of thy Lord's chastisement touched them, they would surely say, 'Alas for us! We were evildoers.'
And We shall set up the just balances for the Resurrection Day, so that not one soul shall be wronged anything; even if it be the weight of one grain of mustard-seed We shall produce it, and sufficient are We for reckoners.
We gave Moses and Aaron the Salvation and a Radiance, and a Remembrance for the godfearing
such as fear God in the Unseen, trembling because of the Hour.
And this is a blessed Remembrance that We have sent down; so are you now denying it?
We gave Abraham aforetime his rectitude -- for We knew him --
when he said to his father and his people, 'What are these statues unto which you are cleaving?'
They said, 'We found our fathers serving them.'
He said, 'Then assuredly you and your fathers have been in manifest error.'
They said, 'What, hast thou come to us with the truth, or art thou one of those that play?'
He said, 'Nay, but your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth who originated them, and I am one of those that bear witness thereunto.
And, by God, I shall assuredly outwit your idols, after you have gone away turning your backs.'
So he broke them into fragments, all but a great one they had, for haply they would return to it.
They said, 'Who has. done this with our gods?
Surely he is one of the evildoers.'
They said, 'We heard a young man making mention of them, and he was called Abraham.'
They said, 'Bring him before the people's eyes; haply they shall bear witness.'
They said, 'So, art thou the man who did this unto our gods, Abraham?'
He said, 'No; it was this great one of them that did it.
Question them; if they are able to speak!'
So they returned one to another, and they said, 'Surely it is you who are the evildoers.'
Then they were utterly put to confusion saying, 'Very well indeed thou knowest these do not speak.'
He said, 'What, and do you serve, apart from God, that which profits you nothing; neither hurts you?
Fie upon you and that you serve apart from God!
Do you not understand?'
They said, 'Burn him, and help your gods, if you would do aught.'
We said, 'O fire, be coolness and safety for Abraham!'
They desired to outwit him; so We made them the worse losers,
and We delivered him, and Lot, unto the land that We had blessed for all beings.
And We gave him Isaac and Jacob in superfluity, and every one made We righteous
and appointed them to be leaders guiding by Our command, and We revealed to them the doing of good deeds, and to perform the prayer, and to pay the alms, and Us they served.
And Lot -- to him We gave judgment and knowledge; and we delivered him from the city that had been doing deeds of corruption; they were an evil people, truly ungodly;
and We admitted him into Our mercy; he was of the righteous.
And Noah -- when he called before, and We answered him, and delivered him and his people from the great distress,
and We helped him against the people who cried lies to Our signs; surely they were an evil people, so We drowned them all together.
And David and Solomon -- when they gave judgment concerning the tillage, when the sheep of the people strayed there, and We bore witness to their judgment;
and We made Solomon to understand it, and unto each gave We judgment and knowledge.
And with David We subjected the mountains to give glory, and the birds, and We were doers.
And We taught him the fashioning of garments for you, to fortify you against your violence; then are you thankful?
And to Solomon the wind, strongly blowing, that ran at his command unto the land that We had blessed; and We had knowledge of everything;
and of the Satans some dived for him and did other work besides; and We were watching over them.
And Job -- when he called unto his Lord, 'Behold, affliction has visited me, and Thou art the most merciful of the merciful.'
So We answered him, and removed the affliction that was upon him, and We gave his people, and the like of them with them, mercy from Us, and a Reminder to those who serve.
And Ishmael, Idris, Dhul Kifl -- each was of the patient,
and We admitted them into Our mercy; they were of the righteous.
And Dhul Nun -- when he went forth enraged and thought that We would have no power over him; then he called out in the darkness, 'There is no god but Thou.
Glory be to Thee! I have done evil.'
So We answered him, and delivered him out of grief; even so do, We deliver the believers.
And Zachariah -- when he called unto his Lord, 'O my Lord, leave me not solitary; though Thou art the best of inheritors.'
So We answered him, and bestowed on him John, and We set his wife right for him; truly they vied with one another, hastening to good works, and called upon Us out of yearning and awe; and they were humble to Us.
And she who guarded her virginity, so We breathed into her of Our spirit and appointed her and her son to be a sign unto all beings.
'Surely this community of yours is one community, and I am your Lord; so serve Me.'
But they split up their affair between them; all shall return to Us.
And whosoever does deeds of righteousness, being a believer, no unthankfulness shall befall his endeavour; We Ourselves write it down for him.
There is a ban upon any city that We have destroyed; they shall not return
till, when Gog and Magog are unloosed, and they slide down out of every slope,
and nigh has drawn the true promise, and behold, the eyes of the unbelievers staring: 'Alas for us! We were heedless of this; 'nay, we were evildoers.'
'Surely you, and that you were serving apart from God, are fuel for Gehenna; you shall go down to it.'
If those had been gods, they would never have gone down to it; yet every one of them shall therein abide forever;'
there shall be sighing for them therein, and naught they shall hear.
But as for those unto whom already the reward most fair has gone forth from Us,
they shall be, kept far from it neither shall they hear any whisper of it, and they shall dwell forever in that their souls desired;
the greatest terror shall not grieve them, and the angels shall receive them: 'This is your day that you were promised.'
On the day when We shall roll up heaven as a scroll is rolled for the writings; as We originated the first creation, so We shall bring it back again -- a promise binding on Us; so We shall do.
For We have written in the Psalms, after the Remembrance, 'The earth shall be the inheritance of My righteous servants.'
Surely in this is a Message delivered unto a people who serve.
We have not sent thee, save as a mercy unto all beings.
Say: 'It is revealed unto me only that your God is One God; do you then surrender?'
Then, if they should turn their backs, say: 'I have proclaimed to you all equally, even though I know not whether near or far is that you are promised.'
Surely He knows what is spoken aloud and He knows what you hide.
I know not; haply it is a trial for you and an enjoyment for a time.
He said: 'My Lord, judge Thou with truth!
And our Lord is the All-merciful; His succour is ever to be sought against that you describe.'
O men, fear your Lord! Surely the earthquake of the Hour is a mighty thing;
on the day when you behold it, every suckling woman shall neglect the child she has suckled, and every pregnant woman shall deposit her burden, and thou shalt see mankind drunk, yet they are not drunk, but God's chastisement is terrible.
And among men there is such a one that disputes concerning God without knowledge and follows every rebel Satan,
against whom it is written down that whosoever takes him for a friend, him he leads astray, and he guides him to the chastisement of the burning.
O men, if you are in doubt as to the Uprising, surely We created you of dust then of a sperm-drop, then of a blood clot, then of a lump of flesh, formed and unformed that We may make clear to you.
And We establish in the wombs what We will, till a stated term, then We deliver you as infants, then that you may come of age; and some of you die, and some of you are kept back unto the vilest state of life, that after knowing somewhat, they may know nothing.
And thou beholdest the earth blackened, then, when We send down water upon it, it quivers, and swells, and puts forth herbs of every joyous kind.
That is because God -- He is the Truth, and brings the dead to life, and is powerful over everything,
and because the Hour is coming, no doubt of it, and God shall raise up whosoever is within the tombs.
And among men there is such a one that disputes concerning God without knowledge or guidance, or an illuminating Book,
turning his side to lead astray from God's way; for him is degradation in this world; and on the Resurrection Day We shall let him taste the chastisement of the burning:
'That is for what thy hands have forwarded and for that God is never unjust unto His servants.'
And among men there is such a one as serves God upon the very edge -- if good befalls him he is at rest in it, but if a trial befalls him he turns completely over; he loses this world and the world to come; that is indeed the manifest loss.
He calls, apart from God, upon that which hurts him not, and which neither profits him anything; that is indeed the far error.
He calls upon him who is likelier to hurt him, rather than to profit him -- an evil protector indeed, he, an evil friend!
God shall surely admit those who believe and do righteous deeds into gardens underneath which rivers flow; surely God does that He desires.
Whosoever thinks God will not help him in the present world and the world to come; let him stretch up a rope to heaven, then let him sever it, and behold whether his guile does away with what enrages him.
Even so We have sent it down as signs, clear signs, and for that God guides whom He desires.
Surely they that believe, and those of Jewry, the Sabaeans, the Christians, the Magians and the idolaters -- God shall distinguish between them on the Day of Resurrection; assuredly God is witness over everything.
Hast thou not seen how to God bow all who are in the and all who are in the earth, heavens the sun and the moon, the stars and the mountains, the trees and the beasts, and many of mankind?
And many merit the chastisement; and whom God abases, there is none to honour him.
God does whatsoever He will.
These are two disputants who have disputed concerning their Lord.
As for the unbelievers, for them garments of fire shall, be cut, and there shall be poured over their heads boiling water
whereby whatsoever is in their bellies and their skins shall be melted;
for them await hooked iron rods;
as often as they desire in their anguish to come forth from it, they shall be restored into it, and: 'Taste the chastisement of the burning!'
God shall surely admit those who believe and do righteous deeds into gardens underneath which rivers flow; therein they shall be adorned with bracelets of gold and with pearls, and their apparel there shall be of silk;
and they; shall be guided unto goodly speech, and they shall be guided unto the path of the All-laudable.
Those who disbelieve, and bar from God's way and the Holy Mosque that We have appointed equal unto men, alike him who cleaves to it and the tent-dweller, and whosoever purposes to violate it wrongly, We shall let him taste a painful chastisement.
And when We settled for Abraham the place of the House: 'Thou shall not associate with Me anything. And do thou purify My House for those that shall go about it and those that stand, for those that bow and prostrate themselves;
and proclaim among men the Pilgrimage, and they shall come unto thee on foot and upon every lean beast, they shall come from every deep ravine
that they may witness things profitable to them and mention God's Name on days well-known over such beasts of the flocks as He has provided them: "So eat thereof, and feed the wretched poor."
Let them then finish with their self-neglect and let them fulfil their vows, and go about the Ancient House.'
All that; and whosoever venerates the sacred things of God, it shall be better for him with his Lord.
And permitted to you are the flocks, except that which is recited to you.
And eschew the abomination of idols, and eschew the speaking of falsehood,
being men pure of faith unto God, not associating with Him anything; for whosoever associates with God anything, it is as though he has fallen from heaven and the birds snatch him away, or the wind sweeps him headlong into a place far away.
All that; and whosoever venerates God's waymarks, that is of the godliness of the hearts.
There are things therein profitable to you unto a stated term; thereafter their lawful place of sacrifice is by the Ancient House.
We have appointed for every nation a holy rite, that they may mention God's Name over such beasts of the flocks as He has provided them.
Your God is One God, so to Him surrender.
And give thou good tidings unto the humble
who, when God is mentioned, their hearts quake, and such as endure patiently whatever visits them, and who perform the prayer, and expend of what We have provided them.
And the beasts of sacrifice -- We have appointed them for you as among God's waymarks; therein is good for you.
So mention God's Name over them, standing in ranks then, when their flanks collapse, eat of them and feed the beggar and the suppliant.
So We have subjected them to you; haply you will be thankful.
The flesh of them shall not reach God, neither their blood, but godliness from you shall reach Him.
So He has subjected them to you, that you may magnify God for that He has guided you.
And give thou good tidings unto the good-doers.
Assuredly God will defend those who believe; surely God loves not any ungrateful traitor.
Leave is given to those who fight because they were wronged -- surely God is able to help them --
who were expelled from their habitations without right, except that they say 'Our Lord is God.'
Had God not driven back the people, some by the means of others, there had been destroyed cloisters and churches, oratories and mosques, wherein God's Name is much mentioned.
Assuredly God will help him who helps Him -- surely God is All-strong, All-mighty
who, if We establish them in the land, perform the prayer, and pay the alms, and bid to honour, and forbid dishonour; and unto God belongs the issue of all affairs.
If they cry lies to thee, so too before them the people of Noah cried lies, and Ad and Thamood,
and the people of Abraham, the people of Lot,
and the men of Midian; to Moses also they cried lies.
And I respited the unbelievers, then I seized them; and how was My horror!
How many a city We have destroyed in its evildoing, and now it is fallen down upon its turrets! How many a ruined well, a tall palace!
What, have they not journeyed in the land so that they have hearts to understand with or ears to hear with?
It is not the eyes that are blind, but blind are the hearts within the breasts.
And they demand of thee to hasten the chastisement!
God will not fail His promise; and surely a day with thy Lord is as a thousand years of your counting.
How many a city I have respited in its evildoing; then I seized it, and to Me was the homecoming.
Say: 'O men, I am only for you a plain warner.'
Those who believe, and do deeds of righteousness -- theirs shall be forgiveness and generous provision.
And those who strive against Our signs to void them -- they shall be the inhabitants of Hell.
We sent not ever any Messenger or Prophet before thee, but that Satan cast into his fancy, when he was fancying; but God annuls what Satan casts, then God confirms His signs -- surely God is All-knowing, All-wise --
that He may make what Satan casts a trial for those in whose hearts is sickness, and those whose hearts are hard; and surely the evildoers are in wide schism;
and that they who have been given knowledge may know that it is the truth from thy Lord and believe in it, and so their hearts be humble unto Him; and assuredly God ever guides those who believe to a straight path.
And the unbelievers will not cease to be in doubt of it, until the Hour comes on them suddenly, or there shall come upon them the chastisement of a barren day.
The Kingdom upon that day shall belong to God, and He shall judge between them.
As for those who believe, and do deeds of righteousness, they shall be in Gardens of Bliss.
But as for the unbelievers, who cried lies to Our signs; for them awaits a humbling chastisement.
And those who emigrated in God's way and were slain, or died, God shall provide them with a fair provision; and surely God is the best of providers.
He shall admit them by a gate that is well-pleasing to them; and surely God is All-knowing, All-clement.
All that; and whosoever chastises after the manner that he was chastised and then again is oppressed, assuredly God will help him; surely God is All-pardoning, All-forgiving.
That is because God makes the night to enter into the day and makes the day to enter into the night; and that God is All-hearing, All-seeing.
That is because God -- He is the Truth, and that they call upon apart from Him -- that is the false; and for that God is the All-high, the All-great.
Hast thou not seen how that God has sent down out of heaven water, and in the morning the earth becomes green?
God is All-subtle, All-aware.
To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth; surely God -- He is the All-sufficient, the All-laudable.
Hast thou not seen how that God has subjected to you all that is in the earth and the ships to run upon the sea at His commandment, and He holds back heaven lest it should fall upon the earth, save by His leave?
Surely God is All-gentle to men, All-compassionate.
It is He who gave you life, then He shall make you dead, then He shall give you life.
Surely man is ungrateful.
We have appointed for every nation a holy rite that they shall perform. Let them not therefore wrangle with thee upon the matter, and do thou summon unto thy Lord; surely thou art upon a straight guidance.
And if they should dispute with thee, do thou say, 'God knows very well what you are doing.
God shall judge between you on the Day of Resurrection touching that whereon you were at variance.'
Didst thou not know that God knows all that is in heaven and earth?
Surely that is in a Book; surely that for God is an easy matter.
They serve, apart from God, that whereon He has sent down never authority and that whereof they have no knowledge; and for the evildoers there shall be no helper.
And when Our signs are recited to them, clear signs, thou recognisest in the faces of the unbelievers denial; wellnigh they rush upon those who recite to them Our signs.
Say: 'Shall I tell you of something worse than that?
The Fire -- God has promised it to the unbelievers -- an evil homecoming!'
O men, a similitude is struck; so give you ear to it. Surely those upon whom you call, apart from God, shall never create a fly, though they banded together to do it; and if a fly should rob them of aught, they would never rescue it from him.
Feeble indeed alike are the seeker and the sought!
They measure not God with His true measure; surely God is All-strong, All-mighty.
God chooses of the angels Messengers and of mankind; surely God is All-hearing, All-seeing.
He knows whatsoever is before them and behind them, and unto God all matters are returned.'
O men, bow you down and prostrate yourselves, and serve your Lord, and do good; haply so you shall prosper;
and struggle for God as is His due, for He has chosen you, and has laid on you no impediment in your religion, being the creed of your father Abraham; He named you Muslims aforetime and in this, that the Messenger might be a witness against you, and that you might be witnesses against mankind. So perform the prayer, and pay the alms, and hold you fast to God; He is your Protector -- an excellent Protector, an excellent Helper.
Prosperous are the believers
who in their prayers are humble
and from idle talk turn away
and at almsgiving are active
and guard their private parts
save from their wives and what their right hands own then being not blameworthy
(but whosoever seeks after more than that, those are the transgressors)
and who preserve their trusts and their covenant
and who observe their prayers.
Those are the inheritors
who shall inherit Paradise therein dwelling forever.
We created man of an extraction of clay,
then We set him, a drop, in a receptacle secure,
then We created of the drop a clot then We created of the clot a tissue then We created of the tissue bones then We garmented the bones in flesh; thereafter We produced him as another creature.
So blessed be God, the fairest of creators!
Then after that you shall surely die,
then on the Day of Resurrection you shall surely be raised up.
And We created above you seven ways, and We were not heedless of creation.
And We sent down out of heaven water in measure and lodged it in the earth; and We are able to take it away.
Then We produced for you therewith gardens of palms and vines wherein are many fruits for you, and of them you eat,
and a tree issuing from the Mount of Sinai that bears oil and seasoning for all to eat.
And surely in the cattle there is a lesson for you; We give you to drink of what is in their bellies, and many uses there are in them for you, and of them you eat;
and upon them, and on the ships, you are borne.
And We sent Noah to his people; and he, said, 'O my people, serve God!
You have no god other than He.
Will you not be godfearing?"
Said the Council of the unbelievers of his people, 'This is naught but a mortal like yourselves, who desires to gain superiority over you.
And if God willed, He would have sent down angels.
We never heard of this among, our fathers, the ancients.
He is naught but a man bedevilled; so wait on him for a time.
He said, 'O my Lord, help me, for that they cry me lies.'
Then We said to him, 'Make thou the Ark under Our eyes and as We reveal, and then, when Our command comes and the Oven boils, insert in it two of every kind and thy, family -- except for him against whom the word already has been spoken; and address Me not concerning those who have done evil; they shall be drowned.
Then, when thou art seated in the Ark and those with thee, say, "Praise belongs to God, who has delivered us from the people of the evildoers."
And say, "'O my Lord, do Thou harbour me in a blessed harbour, for Thou art the best of harbourers."
Surely in that are signs, and surely We put to the test.
Thereafter, after them, We produced another generation,
and We sent amongst them a Messenger of themselves, saying, 'Serve God!
You have no god other than He.
Will you not be godfearing?'
Said the Council of the unbelievers of his people, who cried lies to the encounter of the world to come, and to whom We had given ease in the present' life, 'This is naught but a mortal like yourselves, who eats of what you eat and drinks of what you drink.
If you obey a mortal like yourselves, then you will be losers.
What, does he promise you that when you are dead, and become dust and bones, you shall be brought forth?
Away, away with that you are promised!
There is nothing but our present life; we die, and we live, and we shall not be raised up.
He is naught but a man who has forged against God a lie, and we will not believe him.'
He said, 'O my Lord, help me, for that they cry me lies.'
He said, 'In a little they will be remorseful.'
And the Cry seized them justly, and We made them as scum; so away with the people of the evildoers!
Thereafter, after them, We produced other generations;
no nation outstrips its term, nor do they put it back.
Then sent We Our Messengers successively; whenever its Messenger came to a nation they cried him lies, so We caused some of them to follow others, and We made them as but tales; so away with a people who do not believe!
Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our signs and a manifest authority
unto Pharaoh and his Council; but they waxed proud, and they were a lofty people,
and they said, 'What, shall we believe two mortals like ourselves, whose people are our servants?'
So they cried them lies, and they were among the destroyed.
And We gave Moses the Book, that haply they would be guided;
and We made Mary's son, and his mother, to be a sign, and gave them refuge upon a height, where was a hollow and a spring:
'O Messengers, eat of the good things and do righteousness; surely I know the things you do.
Surely this community of yours is one community, and I am your Lord; so fear Me.'
But they split in their affair between them into sects, each party rejoicing in what is with them.
So leave thou them in their perplexity for a time.
What, do they think that We succour them with of wealth and children,
We vie in good works for them?
Nay, but they are not aware.
Surely those who tremble in fear of their Lord
and those who believe in the signs of their Lord
and those who associate naught with their Lord
and those who give what they give, their hearts quaking that they are returning to their Lord --
those vie in good works, outracing to them.
We charge not any soul save to its capacity, and with Us is a Book speaking truth, and they shall not be wronged.
Nay, but their hearts are in perplexity as to this, and they have deeds besides that that they are doing.
Till, when We seize with the chastisement the ones of them that live at ease, behold, they groan.
'Groan not today; surely you shall not be helped from Us.
My signs were recited to you, but upon your heels you withdrew,
waxing proud against it, talking foolish talk by night.'
Have they not pondered the saying, or came there upon them that which came not upon their fathers, the ancients?
Or did they not recognise their Messenger and so denied him?
Or do they say, 'He is bedevilled'?
Nay, he has brought them the truth, but most of them are averse from the truth.
Had the truth followed their caprices, the heavens and the earth and whosoever in them is had surely corrupted.
Nay, We brought them their Remembrance, but from their Remembrance they turned.
Or dost thou ask them for tribute?
Yet the tribute of thy Lord is better, and He is the best of providers.
Assuredly thou art calling them to a straight path;
and surely they that believe not in the world to come are deviating from the path.
Did We have mercy on them, and remove the affliction that is upon them, they would persist in their insolence wandering blindly.
We already seized them with the chastisement, yet they abased not themselves to their Lord nor were they humble;
until, when We open against them a door of terrible chastisement, lo, they are sore confounded at it.
It is He who produced for you hearing, and eyes, and hearts; little thanks you show.
It is He who scattered you in the earth, and to Him you shall be mustered.
It is He who gives life, and makes to die, and to Him belongs the alternation of night and day; what, will you not understand?
Nay, but they said the like of what the ancients said.
They said, 'What, when we are dead and become dust and bones, shall we be indeed raised up?
We and our fathers have been promised this before; this is naught but the fairy-tales of the ancients.'
Say: 'Whose is the earth, and whoso is in it, if you have knowledge?'
They will say, God's.'
Say: 'Will you not then remember?'
Say: 'Who is the Lord of the seven heavens and the Lord of the mighty Throne?'
They will say, 'God's.'
Say: 'Will you not then be godfearing?'
Say: 'In whose hand is the dominion of everything, protecting and Himself unprotected, if you have knowledge?'
They will say, 'God's.'
Say: 'How then are you bewitched?
Nay, but We brought them the truth and they are truly liars.
God has not taken to Himself any son, nor is there any god with Him; for then each god would have taken off that he created and some of them would have risen up over others; glory to be God, beyond that they describe,
who has knowledge of the Unseen and the Visible; high exalted be He, above that they associate!
Say: 'O my Lord, if Thou shouldst show me that they are promised,
O my Lord, put me not among the people of the evildoers.'
Assuredly, We are able to show thee that We promise them.
Repel thou the evil with that which is fairer.
We Ourselves know very well that they describe.
And say: 'O my Lord, I take refuge in Thee from the evil suggestions of the Satans,
and I take refuge in Thee, O my Lord, lest they attend me.'
Till, when death comes to one of them, he says, 'My Lord, return me;
haply I shall do righteousness in that I forsook.'
Nay, it is but a word he speaks; and there; behind them, is a barrier until the day that they shall be raised up.
For when the Trumpet is blown, that day there shall be no kinship any more between them, neither will they question one another.
Then he whose scales are heavy -- they are the prosperers,
and he whose scales are light -- they have lost their souls in Gehenna dwelling forever,
the Fire smiting their faces the while they glower there.
'What, were My signs not recited to you, and you cried them lies?'
They shall say, 'Our Lord, our adversity prevailed over us; we were an erring people.
Our Lord, bring us forth out of it!
Then, if we revert, we shall be evildoers indeed.'
'Slink you into it,' He shall say, 'and do not speak to Me.
There is a party of My servants who said, "Our Lord, we believe; therefore forgive us, and have mercy on us, for Thou art the best of the merciful."
But you took them for a laughing-stock, till they made you forget My remembrance, mocking at them.
Now today I have recompensed them for their patient endurance; they are the triumphant.'
He shall say, 'How long have you tarried in the earth, by number of years?'
They shall say, 'We have tarried a day, or part of a day; ask the numberers!'
He shall say, 'You have tarried but a little, did you know.
What, did you think that We created you only for sport, and that you would not be returned to Us?'
Then high exalted be God, the King, the True!
There is no god but He? the Lord of the noble Throne.
And whosoever calls upon another god with God, whereof he has no proof, his reckoning is with his Lord; surely the unbelievers shall not prosper.
And say: 'My Lord, forgive and have mercy, for Thou art the best of the merciful.'
A sura that We have sent down and appointed; and We have sent down in it signs, clear signs, that haply you will remember.
The fornicatress and the fornicator -- scourge each one of them a hundred stripes, and in the matter of God's religion let no tenderness for them seize you if you believe in God and the Last Day; and let a party of the believers witness their chastisement.
The fornicator shall marry none but a fornicatress or an idolatress, and the fornicatress -- none shall marry her but a fornicator or an idolator; that is forbidden to the believers.
And those who cast it up on women in wedlock, and then bring not four witnesses, scourge them with eighty stripes, and do not accept any testimony of theirs ever; those -- they are the ungodly,
save such as repent thereafter and make amends; surely God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
And those who cast it up on their wives having no witnesses except themselves, the testimony of one of them shall be to testify by God four times that he is of the truthful,
and a fifth time, that the curse of God shall be upon him, if he should be of the liars.
It shall avert from her the chastisement if she testify by God four times that he is of the liars,
and a fifth time, that the wrath of God shall be upon her, if he should be of the truthful.
But for God's bounty to you and His mercy and that God turns, and is All-wise --
Those who came with the slander are a band of you; do not reckon it evil for you; rather it is good for you.
Every man of them shall have the sin that he has earned charged to him; and whosoever of them took upon himself the greater part of it, him there awaits a mighty chastisement.
Why, when you heard it, did the believing men and women not of their own account think good thoughts, and say, 'This is a manifest calumny'?
Why did they not bring four witnesses against it?
But since they did not bring the witnesses, in God's sight they are the liars.
But for God's bounty to you and His mercy in the present world and the world to come there would have visited you for your mutterings a mighty chastisement.
When you received it on your tongues, and were speaking with your mouths that whereof you had no knowledge, and reckoned it a light thing, and with God it was a mighty thing --
And why, when you heard it, did you not say, 'It is not for us to speak about this; glory be to Thee!
This is a mighty calumny'?
God admonishes you, that you shall never repeat the like of it again; if you are believers.
God makes clear to you the signs; and God is All-knowing, All-wise.
Those who love that indecency should be spread abroad concerning them that believe -- there awaits them a painful chastisement in the present world and the world to come; and God knows, and you know not.
But for God's bounty to you and His mercy and that God is All-gentle, All-compassionate --
O believers, follow not the steps of Satan; for whosoever follows the steps of Satan, assuredly he bids to indecency and dishonour.
But for God's bounty to you and His mercy not one of you would have been pure ever; but God purifies whom He will; and God is All-hearing, All-knowing.
Let not those of you who possess bounty and plenty swear off giving kinsmen and the poor and those who emigrate in the way of God; but let them pardon and forgive.
Do you not wish that God should forgive you?
God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
Surely those who cast it up on women in wedlock that are heedless but believing shall be accursed in the present world and the world to come; and there awaits them a mighty chastisement
on the day when their tongues, their hands and their feet shall testify against them touching that they were doing.
Upon that day God will pay them in full their just due, and they shall know that God is the manifest Truth.
Corrupt women for corrupt men, and corrupt men for corrupt women; good women for good men, and good men for good women -- these are declared quit of what they say; theirs shall be forgiveness and generous provision.
O believers, do not enter houses other than your houses until you first ask leave and, salute the people thereof; that is better for you; haply you will remember.
And if you find not anyone therein, enter it not until leave is given to you.
And if you are told, 'Return,' return; that is purer for you; and God knows the things you do.
There is no fault in you that you enter houses uninhabited wherein enjoyment is for you.
God knows what you reveal and what you hide.
Say to the believers, that they cast down their eyes and guard their private parts; that is purer for them.
God is aware of the things they work.
And say to the believing women, that they cast down their eyes' and guard their private parts, and reveal not their adornment save such as is outward; and let them cast their veils over their bosoms, and not reveal their adornment save to their husbands, or their fathers, or their husbands' fathers, or their sons, or their husbands' sons, or their brothers, or their brothers' sons, or their sisters' sons, or their women, or what their right hands own, or such men as attend them, not having sexual desire, or children who have not yet attained knowledge of women's private parts; nor let them stamp their feet, so that their hidden ornament may be known.
And turn all together to God, O you believers; haply so you will prosper.
Marry the spouseless among you, and your slaves and handmaidens that are righteous; if they are poor, God will enrich them of His bounty; God is All-embracing, All-knowing.
And let those who find not the means to marry be abstinent till God enriches them of His bounty.
Those your right hands own who seek emancipation, contract with them accordingly, if you know some good in them; and give them of the wealth of God that He has given you.
And constrain not your slave-girls to prostitution, if they desire to live in chastity, that you may seek the chance goods of the present life.
Whosoever constrains them, surely God, after their being constrained, is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
Now We have sent down to you signs making all clear, and an example of those who passed away before you, and an admonition for the godfearing.
God is the Light of the heavens and the earth; the likeness of His Light is as a niche wherein is a lamp (the lamp in a glass, the glass as it were a glittering star) kindled from a Blessed Tree, an olive that is neither of the East nor of the West whose oil wellnigh would shine, even if no fire touched it; Light upon Light; (God guides to His Light whom He will.) (And God strikes similitudes for men, and God has knowledge of everything.)
in temples God has allowed to be raised up, and His Name to be commemorated therein; therein glorifying Him, in the mornings and the evenings,
are men whom neither commerce nor trafficking diverts from the remembrance of God and to perform the prayer, and to pay the alms, fearing a day when hearts and eyes shall be turned about,
that God may recompense them for their fairest works and give them increase of His bounty; and God provides whomsoever He will, without reckoning.
And as for the unbelievers, their works are as a mirage in a spacious plain which the man athirst supposes to be water, till, when he comes to it, he finds it is nothing; there indeed he finds God, and He pays him his account in full; (and God is swift at the reckoning.)
or they are as shadows upon a sea obscure covered by a billow above which is a billow above which are clouds, shadows piled one upon another; when he puts forth his hand, wellnigh he cannot see it.
And to whomsoever God assigns no light, no light has he.
Hast thou not seen how that whatsoever is in the heavens and in the earth extols God, and the birds spreading their wings?
Each -- He knows its prayer and its extolling; and God knows the things they do.
To God belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and to Him is the homecoming.
'hast thou not seen how God drives the clouds, then composes them, then converts them into a mass, then thou seest the rain issuing out of the midst of them?
And He sends down out of heaven mountains, wherein is hail, so that He smites whom He will with it, and turns it aside from whom He will; wellnigh the gleam of His lightning snatches away the sight.
God turns about the day and the night; surely in that is a lesson for those who have eyes.
God has created every beast of water, and some of them go upon their bellies, and some of them go upon two feet, and some of them go upon four; God creates whatever He will; God is powerful over everything.
Now We have sent down signs making all clear; God guides whomsoever He will to a straight path.
They say, 'We believe in God and the Messenger, and we obey.'
Then after that a party of them turn away; those -- they are not believers.
When they are called to God and His Messenger that he may judge between them, lo, a party of them are swerving aside;
but if they are in the right, they will come to him submissively.
What, is there sickness in their hearts, or are they in doubt, or do they fear that God may be unjust towards them and His Messenger?
Nay, but those -- they are the evildoers.
All that the believers say, when they are called to God and His Messenger, that he may judge between them, is that they say, 'We hear, and we obey'; those -- they are the prosperers.
Whoso obeys God and His Messenger, and fears God and has awe of Him, those -- they are the triumphant.
They have sworn by God the most earnest oaths, if thou commandest them they will go forth.
Say: 'Do not swear; honourable obedience is sufficient.
Surely God is aware of the things you do.'
Say: 'Obey God, and obey the Messenger; then, if you turn away, only upon him rests what is laid on him, and upon you rests what is laid on you.
If you obey him, you will be guided.
It is only for the Messenger to deliver the manifest Message.'
God has promised those of you who believe and do righteous deeds that He will surely make you successors in the land, even as He made those who were before them successors, and that He will surely establish their religion for them that He has approved. for them, and will give them in exchange, after their fear, security: 'They shall serve Me, not associating with Me anything.'
Whoso disbelieves after that, those - they are the ungodly.
Perform the prayer, and pay the alms, and obey the Messenger -- haply so you will find mercy.
Think not the unbelievers able to frustrate God in the earth; their refuge is the Fire -- an evil homecoming.
O believers, let those your right hands own and those of you who have not reached puberty ask leave of you three times -- before the prayer of dawn, and when you put off your garments at the noon, and after the evening prayer -- three times of nakedness for you.
There is no fault in you or them, apart from these, that you go about one to the other.
So God makes clear to you the signs; and God is All-knowing, All-wise.
When your children reach puberty, let them ask leave, as those before them asked leave.
So God makes clear to you His signs; and God is All-knowing, All-wise.
Such women as are past child- bearing and have no hope of marriage -- there is no fault in them that they put off their clothes, so be it that they flaunt no ornament; but to abstain is better for them; and God is All-hearing, All-knowing.
There is no fault in the blind, and there is no fault in the lame, and there is no fault in the sick, neither in yourselves, that you eat of your houses, or your fathers' houses, or your mothers' houses, or your brothers' houses, or your sisters' houses, or the houses of your uncles or your aunts paternal, or the houses of your uncles or your aunts maternal, or that whereof you own the keys, or of your friend; there is no fault in you that you eat all together, or in groups separately.
But when you enter houses, greet one another with a greeting from God, blessed and good.
So God makes clear to you the signs; haply you will understand.
Those only are believers, who believe in God and His Messenger and who, when they are with him upon a common matter, go not away until they ask his leave.
Surely those who ask thy leave -- those are they that believe in God and His Messenger; so, when they ask thy leave for some affair of their own, give leave to whom thou wilt of them, and ask God's forgiveness for them; surely God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
Make not the calling of the Messenger among yourselves like your calling one of another.
God knows those of you who slip away surreptitiously; so let those who go against His command beware, lest a trial befall them, or there befall them a painful chastisement.
Why, surely to God belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth; He ever knows what state you are upon; and the day when they shall be returned to Him, then He will tell them of what they did; and God knows everything.
Blessed be He who has sent down the Salvation upon His servant, that he may be a warner to all beings;
to whom belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth; and He has not taken to Him a son, and He has no associate in the Kingdom; and He created every thing, then He ordained it very exactly.
Yet they have taken to them gods, apart from Him, that create nothing and themselves are created, and have no power to hurt or profit themselves, no power of death or life or raising up.
The unbelievers say, 'This is naught but a calumny he has forged, and other folk have helped him to it.'
So they have committed wrong and falsehood.
They say, 'Fairy-tales of the ancients that he has had written down, so that they are recited to him at the dawn and in the evening.'
Say: 'He sent it down, who knows the secret in the heavens and earth; He is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.'
They also say, 'What ails this Messenger that he eats food, and goes in the markets?
Why has an angel not been sent down to him, to be a warner with him?
Or why is not a treasure thrown to him, or why has he not a Garden to eat of?'
The evildoers say, 'You are only following a man bewitched!'
Behold, how they strike similitudes for thee, and go astray, and are unable to find a way!
Blessed be He who, if He will, shall assign to them better than that -- gardens underneath which rivers flow, and he shall assign to thee palaces.
Nay, but they cry lies to the Hour; and We have prepared for him who cries lies to the Hour a Blaze.
When it sees them from a far place, they shall hear its bubbling and sighing.
And when they are cast, coupled in fetters, into a narrow place of that Fire, they will call out there for destruction.
'Call not out today for one destruction, but call for many!'
Say: 'Is that better, or the Garden of Eternity, that is promised to the godfearing, and is their recompense and homecoming?'
Therein they shall have what they will dwelling forever; it is a promise binding upon thy Lord, and of Him to be required.
Upon the day when He shall muster them and that they serve, apart from God, and He shall say, 'Was it you that led these My servants astray, or did they themselves err from the way?'
They shall 'Glory be to Thee!
It did not behove us to take unto say, ourselves protectors apart from Thee; but Thou gavest them and their fathers enjoyment of days, until they forgot
the Remembrance, and were a people corrupt.' So they cried lies touching the things you say, and you can neither turn it aside, nor find any help.
Whosoever of you does evil, We shall let him taste a great chastisement.
And We sent not before thee any Envoys, but that they ate food, and went in the markets; and We appointed some of you to be a trial for others: 'Will you endure?'
Thy Lord is ever All-seeing.
Say those who look not to encounter Us, 'Why have the angels not been sent down on us, or why see we not our Lord?'
Waxed proud they have within them, and become greatly disdainful.
Upon the day that they see the angels, no good tidings that day for the sinners; they shall say, 'A ban forbidden!'
We shall advance upon what work they have done, and make it a scattered dust.
The inhabitants of Paradise that day, better shall be their lodging, fairer their resting-place.
Upon the day that heaven is split asunder with the clouds and the angels are sent down in majesty,
the Kingdom that day, the true Kingdom, shall belong to the All-merciful and it shall be a day harsh for the unbelievers.
Upon the day the evildoer shall bite his hands, saying, 'Would that I had taken a way along with the Messenger!
Alas, would that I had not taken So-and-so for a friend!
He indeed led me astray from the Remembrance, after it had come to me; Satan is ever a forsaker of men.'
The Messenger says, 'O my Lord, behold, my people have taken this Koran as a thing to be shunned.'
Even so We have appointed to every Prophet an enemy among the sinners; but thy Lord suffices as a guide and as a helper.
The unbelievers say, 'Why has the Koran not been sent down upon him all at once?'
Even so, that We may strengthen thy heart thereby, and We have chanted it very distinctly.
They bring not to thee any similitude but that We bring thee the truth, and better in exposition.
Those who shall be mustered to Gehenna upon their faces -- they shall be worse in place, and gone further astray from the way.
We gave Moses the Book, and appointed with him his brother Aaron as minister
and We said, 'Go to the people who have cried lies to Our signs'; then We destroyed them utterly.
And the people of Noah, when they cried lies to the Messengers, We drowned them, and made them to be a sign to mankind; and We have prepared for the evildoers a painful chastisement.
And Ad, and Thamood, and the men of Er-Rass, and between that generations a many,
for each We struck similitudes, and each We ruined utterly.
Surely they have come by the city that was rained on by an evil rain; what, have they not seen it?
Nay, but they look for no upraising.
And when they see thee, they take thee in mockery only: 'What, is this he whom God sent forth as a Messenger?
Wellnigh he had led us astray from our gods, but that we kept steadfast to them.'
Assuredly they shall know, when they see the chastisement, who is further astray from the way.
Hast thou seen him who has taken his caprice to be his god?
Wilt thou be a guardian over them?
Or deemest thou that most of them hear or understand?
They are but as the cattle; nay, they are further astray from the way.
Hast thou not regarded thy Lord, how He has stretched out the shadow?
Had He willed, He would have made it still.
Then We appointed the sun, to be a guide to it;
thereafter We seize it to Ourselves, drawing it gently.
It is He who appointed the night for you to be a garment and sleep for a rest, and day He appointed for a rising.
And it is He who has loosed the winds, bearing good tidings before His mercy; and We sent down from heaven pure water
so that We might revive a dead land, and give to drink of it, of that We created, cattle and men a many.
We have indeed turned it about amongst them, so that they may remember; yet most men refuse all but unbelief.
If We had willed, We would have raised up in every city a warner.
So obey not the unbelievers, but struggle with them thereby mightily.
And it is He who let forth the two seas, this one Sweet, grateful to taste, and this salt, bitter to the tongue, and He set between them a barrier, and a ban forbidden.
And it is He who created of water a mortal, and made him kindred of blood and marriage; thy Lord is All-powerful.
And they serve, apart from God, what neither profits them nor hurts them; and the unbeliever is ever a partisan against his Lord.
We have sent thee not, except good tidings to bear, and warning.
Say: 'I do not ask of you a wage for this, except for him who wishes to take to his Lord a way.'
Put thy trust in the Living God, the Undying, and proclaim His praise.
Sufficiently is He aware of His servants sins
who created the heavens and the earth, and what between them is, in six days, then sat Himself upon the Throne, the All-compassionate: ask any informed of Him!
But when they are told, 'Bow yourselves to the All-merciful,' they say, 'And what is the All-merciful?
Shall we bow ourselves to what thou biddest us?'
And it increases them in aversion.
Blessed be He who has set in heaven constellations, and has set among them a lamp, and an illuminating moon.
And it is He who made the night and day a succession for whom He desires to remember or He desires to be thankful.
The servants of the All-merciful are those who walk in the earth modestly and who, when the ignorant address them, say, 'Peace';
who pass the night prostrate to their Lord and standing;
who say, 'Our Lord, turn Thou from us the chastisement of Gehenna; surely its chastisement is torment most terrible;
evil it is as a lodging-place and an abode';
who, when they expend, are neither prodigal nor parsimonious, but between that is a just stand;
who call not upon another god with God, nor slay the soul God has forbidden except by right, neither fornicate, for whosoever does that shall meet the price
of sin-doubled shall be the chastisement for him on the Resurrection Day, and he shall dwell therein humbled,
save him who repents, and believes, and does righteous work -- those, God will change their evil deeds into good deeds, for God is ever All-forgiving, All-compassionate;
and whosoever repents, and does righteousness, he truly turns to God in repentance.
And those who bear not false witness and, when they pass by idle talk, pass by with dignity;
who, when they are reminded of the signs of their Lord, fall not down thereat deaf and blind;
who say, 'Our Lord, give us refreshment of our wives and seed, and make us a model to the godfearing.'
Those shall be recompensed with the highest heaven, for that they endured patiently, and they shall receive therein a greeting and --' Peace!'
Therein they shall dwell forever; fair it is as a lodging-place and an abode.
Say: 'My Lord esteems you not at all were it not for your prayer, for you have cried lies, and it shall surely be fastened.'
Ta Sin Mim
Those are the signs of the Manifest Book.
Perchance thou consumest thyself that they are not believers.
If We will, We shall send down on them out of heaven a sign, so their necks will stay humbled to it.
But never fresh remembrance comes to them from the All-merciful, except they turn away from it.
So they have cried lies; therefore assuredly tidings will come to them of that they mocked at.
What, have they not regarded the earth, how many therein We have caused to grow of every generous kind?
Surely in that is a sign, yet most of them are not believers.
Surely thy Lord, He is the All-mighty, the All-compassionate.
And when thy Lord called to Moses, 'Go to the people of the evildoers,
the people of Pharaoh; will they not be godfearing?'
He said, 'My Lord, I fear they will cry me lies,
and my breast will be straitened, and my tongue will not be loosed; so send to Aaron.
They also have a sin against me, and I fear they will slay me.'
Said He, 'No indeed; but go, both of you, with Our signs, and We assuredly shall be with you, listening.
So go you to Pharaoh, and say, "Verily, I am the Messenger of the Lord of all Being;
so send forth with us the Children of Israel."
He said, 'Did we not raise thee amongst us as a child?
Didst thou not tarry among us years of thy life?
And thou didst the deed thou didst, being one of the ungrateful!'
Said he, 'Indeed I did it then, being one of those that stray;
so I fled from you, fearing you. But my Lord gave me Judgment and made me one of the Envoys.
That is a blessing thou reproachest me with, having enslaved the Children of Israel.'
Pharaoh said, 'And what is the Lord of all Being?'
He said, 'The Lord of the heavens and earth, and what between them is, if you have faith.'
Said he to those about him, 'Do you not hear?'
He said, 'Your Lord and the Lord of your fathers, the ancients.'
Said he, 'Surely your Messenger who was sent to you is possessed!'
He said, 'The Lord of the East and West, and what between them is, if you have understanding,'
Said he, 'If thou takest a god other than me, I shall surely make thee one of the imprisoned.'
He said, 'What, even though I brought thee something so manifest?'
Said he, 'Bring it then, if thou art of the truthful.'
So he cast his staff, and behold, it was a serpent manifest.
And he drew forth his hand, and lo, it was white to the beholders.
Said he to the Council about him, 'Surely this man is a cunning sorcerer
who desires to expel you from your land by his sorcery; what do you command?'
They said, 'Put him and his brother off a while, and send among the cities musterers,
to bring thee every cunning sorcerer.
So the sorcerers were assembled for the appointed time of a fixed day.
The people were asked, 'Will you assemble?
Haply we shall follow the sorcerers if it should be they are the victors.'
Then, when the sorcerers came, they said to Pharaoh, 'Shall we indeed have a wage, if we should be the victors?'
He said, 'Yes indeed; and you shall then be among the near-stationed.'
Moses said to them, 'Cast you down what you will cast.'
So they cast their ropes and their staffs, and said, 'By the might of Pharaoh we shall be the victors.'
Then Moses cast his staff and lo, it forthwith swallowed up their lying invention;
so the sorcerers were cast down, bowing themselves.
They said, 'We believe in the Lord of all Being,
the Lord of Moses and Aaron.'
Said Pharaoh, 'You have believed him before I gave you leave.
Why, he is the chief of you, the same that taught you sorcery; now you shall know!
I shall assuredly cut off alternately your hands and feet, then I shall crucify you all together.'
They said, 'There is no harm; surely unto our Lord we are turning.
We are eager that our Lord should forgive us our offences, for that we are the first of the believers.'
Also We revealed unto Moses, 'Go with My servants by night; surely you will be followed.'
Then Pharaoh sent among the cities musterers:
'Behold, these are a small troop,
and indeed they are enraging us;
and we are a host on our guard.'
So We expelled them from gardens and fountains,
and treasures and a noble station;
even so, and We bequeathed them upon the Children of Israel.
Then they followed them at the sunrise;
and, when the two hosts sighted each other, the companions of Moses said, 'We are overtaken!'
Said he, 'No indeed; surely my Lord is with me; He will guide me.'
Then We revealed to Moses, 'Strike with thy staff the sea'; and it clave, and each part was as a mighty mount.
And there We brought the others on,
and We delivered Moses and those with him all together;
then We drowned the others.
Surely in that is a sign, yet most of them are not believers.
Surely thy Lord, He is the All-mighty, the All-compassionate.
And recite to them the tiding of Abraham
when he said to his father and his people, 'What do you serve?'
They said, 'We serve idols, and continue cleaving to them.
He said, 'Do they hear you when you call,
or do they profit you, or harm?'
They said, 'Nay, but we found our fathers so doing.'
He said, 'And have you considered what you have been serving,
you and your fathers, the elders?
They are an enemy to me, except the Lord of all Being
who created me, and Himself guides me,
and Himself gives me to eat and drink,
and, whenever I am sick, heals me,
who makes me to die, then gives me life,
and who I am eager shall forgive me my offence on the Day of Doom.
My Lord, give me Judgment, and join me with the righteous,
and appoint me a tongue of truthfulness among the others.
Make me one of the inheritors of the Garden of Bliss
and forgive my father, for he is one of those astray.
Degrade me not upon the day when they are raised up,
the day when neither wealth nor sons shall profit
except for him who comes to God with a pure heart.
And Paradise shall be brought forward for the godfearing,
and Hell advanced for the perverse.
It shall be said to them, 'Where is that you were serving
apart from God?
Do they help you or help themselves?'
Then they shall be pitched into it, they and the perverse
and the hosts of Iblis, all together.
They shall say, as they dispute there one with another,
'By God, we were certainly in manifest error
when we made you equal with the Lord of all Being.
It was naught but the sinners that led us astray;
so now we have no intercessors,
no loyal friend.
O that we might return again, and be among the believers!'
Surely in that is a sign, yet most of them are not believers.
Surely thy Lord, He is the All-mighty, the All-compassionate.
The people of Noah cried lies to the Envoys
when their brother Noah said to them, 'Will you not be godfearing?
I am for you a faithful Messenger,
so serve you God, and obey you me.
I ask of you no wage for this; my wage falls only upon the Lord of all Being;
so fear you God, and obey you me.'
They said, 'Shall we believe thee, whom the vilest follow?'
He said, 'What knowledge have I of that they have been doing?
Their account falls only upon my Lord, were you but aware.
I would not drive away the believers;
'I am naught but a plain warner.'
They said, 'If thou givest not over, Noah, thou shalt assuredly be one of the stoned.'
He said, 'My Lord, my people have cried me lies,
so give true deliverance between me and them, and deliver me and the believers that are with me.
So We delivered him, and those with him, in the laden ship,
then afterwards We drowned the rest.
Surely in that is a sign, yet most of them are not believers.
Surely thy Lord, He is the All-mighty, the All-compassionate.
